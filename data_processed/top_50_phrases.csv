high up crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the old chateau of my ancestors for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the mossgrown castle walls these ancient turrets stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time formed in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all france from its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements barons counts and even kings had been defied yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invaderbut since those glorious years all is changed a poverty but little above the level of dire want together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour and the falling stones of the walls the overgrown vegetation in the parks the dry and dusty moat the illpaved courtyards and toppling towers without as well as the sagging floors the wormeaten wainscots and the faded tapestries within all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur as the ages passed first one then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estateit was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that i antoine last of the unhappy and accursed comtes de c first saw the light of day ninety long years ago within these walls and amongst the dark and shadowy forests the wild ravines and grottoes of the hillside below were spent the first years of my troubled life my parents i never knew my father had been killed at the age of thirtytwo a month before i was born by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle and my mother having died at my birth my care and education devolved solely upon one remaining servitor an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence whose name i remember as pierre i was an only child and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill at the time pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company now i know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearthsthus isolated and thrown upon my own resources i spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadowhaunted library of the chateau and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot it was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attentionof my own race i was permitted to learn singularly little yet what small knowledge of it i was able to gain seemed to depress me much perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which i ever felt at the mention of my great house yet as i grew out of childhood i was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which i had always deemed strange but which now became dimly terrible the circumstance to which i allude is the early age at which all the comtes of my line had met their end whilst i had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of shortlived men i afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirtytwo years upon my twentyfirst birthday the aged pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son and continued by each possessor its contents were of the most startling nature and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions at this time my belief in the supernatural was firm and deepseated else i should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyesthe paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century when the old castle in which i sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress it told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our estates a person of no small accomplishments though little above the rank of peasant by name michel usually designated by the surname of mauvais the evil on account of his sinister reputation he had studied beyond the custom of his kind seeking such things as the philosophers stone or the elixir of eternal life and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy michel mauvais had one son named charles a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts and who had therefore been called le sorcier or the wizard this pair shunned by all honest folk were suspected of the most hideous practices old michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the devil and the unaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray of humanity the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affectionone night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young godfrey son to henri the comte a searching party headed by the frantic father invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old michel mauvais busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron without certain cause in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair the comte laid hands on the aged wizard and ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no more meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain as the comte and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists the form of charles le sorcier appeared through the trees the excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred yet he seemed at first unmoved at his fathers fate then slowly advancing to meet the comte he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of cmay neer a noble of thy murdrous linesurvive to reach a greater age than thinespake he when suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his fathers slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night the comte died without utterance and was buried the next day but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth no trace of the assassin could be found though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighbouring woods and the meadowland around the hillthus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the minds of the late comtes family so that when godfrey innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title was killed by an arrow whilst hunting at the age of thirtytwo there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise but when years afterward the next young comte robert by name was found dead in a nearby field from no apparent cause the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his thirtysecond birthday when surprised by early death louis son to robert was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle henris roberts antoines and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murderthat i had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which i read my life previously held at small value now became dearer to me each day as i delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic isolated as i was modern science had produced no impression upon me and i laboured as in the middle ages as wrapt as had been old michel and young charles themselves in the acquisition of daemonological and alchemical learning yet read as i might in no manner could i account for the strange curse upon my line in unusually rational moments i would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister charles le sorcier and his heirs yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist i would fall back to occult studies and once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house from its terrible burden upon one thing i was absolutely resolved i should never wed for since no other branches of my family were in existence i might thus end the curse with myselfas i drew near the age of thirty old pierre was called to the land beyond alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau which in youth fear had caused me to shun and some of which old pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries strange and awesome were many of the objects i encountered furniture covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness met my eyes cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloomof my exact age even down to days and hours i kept a most careful record for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence at length i approached that time which i had so long viewed with apprehension since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of comte henri at his end i was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death in what strange form the curse should overtake me i knew not but i was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contentsit was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle less than a week before that fatal hour which i felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth beyond which i could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that i came upon the culminating event of my whole life i had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down halfruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets as the afternoon progressed i sought the lower levels descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder as i slowly traversed the nitreencrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase the paving became very damp and soon i saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank waterstained wall impeded my journey turning to retrace my steps my eye fell upon a small trapdoor with a ring which lay directly beneath my feet pausing i succeeded with difficulty in raising it whereupon there was revealed a black aperture exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps as soon as the torch which i lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and steadily i commenced my descent the steps were many and led to a narrow stoneflagged passage which i knew must be far underground the passage proved of great length and terminated in a massive oaken door dripping with the moisture of the place and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction i had proceeded back some distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind without warningi heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hingesmy immediate sensations are incapable of analysis to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as i had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description when at last i turned and faced the seat of the sound my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld there in the ancient gothic doorway stood a human figure it was that of a man clad in a skullcap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour his long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue and of incredible profusion his forehead high beyond the usual dimensions his cheeks deepsunken and heavily lined with wrinkles and his hands long clawlike and gnarled were of such a deathly marblelike whiteness as i have never elsewhere seen in man his figure lean to the proportions of a skeleton was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment but strangest of all were his eyes twin caves of abysmal blackness profound in expression of understanding yet inhuman in degree of wickedness these were now fixed upon me piercing my soul with their hatred and rooting me to the spot whereon i stood at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence the language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of latin in use amongst the more learned men of the middle ages and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and daemonologists the apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house told me of my coming end dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old michel mauvais and gloated over the revenge of charles le sorcier he told how the young charles had escaped into the night returning in after years to kill godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his fathers at his assassination how he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself unknown in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator how he had seized robert son of godfrey in a field forced poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of thirtytwo thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards father and son speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youthhis enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them but suddenly the fiendish glare returned and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had charles le sorcier six hundred years before ended that of my ancestor prompted by some preserving instinct of selfdefence i broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance the shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the wouldbe assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves and i fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faintwhen at last my senses returned all was frightfully dark and my mind remembering what had occurred shrank from the idea of beholding more yet curiosity overmastered all who i asked myself was this man of evil and how came he within the castle walls why should he seek to avenge the death of poor michel mauvais and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of charles le sorcier the dread of years was lifted from my shoulders for i knew that he whom i had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse and now that i was free i burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries and made of my own youth one longcontinued nightmare determined upon further exploration i felt in my pockets for flint and steel and lit the unused torch which i had with me first of all the new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger the hideous eyes were now closed disliking the sight i turned away and entered the chamber beyond the gothic door here i found what seemed much like an alchemists laboratory in one corner was an immense pile of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch it may have been gold but i did not pause to examine it for i was strangely affected by that which i had undergone at the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest filled with wonder yet now realising how the man had obtained access to the chateau i proceeded to return i had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face but as i approached the body i seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound as though life were not yet wholly extinct aghast i turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor then all at once the horrible eyes blacker even than the seared face in which they were set opened wide with an expression which i was unable to interpret the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand once i caught the name of charles le sorcier and again i fancied that the words years and curse issued from the twisted mouth still i was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech at my evident ignorance of his meaning the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me until helpless as i saw my opponent to be i trembled as i watched himsuddenly the wretch animated with his last burst of strength raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement then as i remained paralysed with fear he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights fool he shrieked can you not guess my secret have you no brain whereby you may recognise the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house have i not told you of the great elixir of eternal life know you not how the secret of alchemy was solved i tell you it is i ii that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revengefor i am charles le sorcier,1
hello bruce havent seen you in a dogs age come ini threw open the door and he followed me into the room his gaunt ungainly figure sprawled awkwardly into the chair i indicated and he twirled his hat between nervous fingers his deepset eyes wore a worried hunted look and he glanced furtively around the room as if searching for a hidden something which might unexpectedly pounce upon him his face was haggard and colorless the corners of his mouth twitched spasmodicallywhats the matter old man you look as if youd seen a ghost brace up i crossed to the buffet and poured a small glass of wine from the decanter drink thishe downed it with a hasty gulp and took to toying with his hat againthanks praguei dont feel quite myself tonightyou dont look it either whats wrongmalcolm bruce shifted uneasily in his chairi eyed him in silence for a moment wondering what could possibly affect the man so strongly i knew bruce as a man of steady nerves and iron will to find him so visibly upset was in itself unusual i passed cigars and he selected one automaticallyit was not until the second cigar had been lighted that bruce broke the silence his nervousness was apparently gone once more he was the dominant selfreliant figure i knew of oldprague he began ive just been through the most devilish gruesome experience that ever befell a man i dont know whether i dare tell it or not for fear youll think ive gone crazyand i wouldnt blame you if you did but its true every word of ithe paused dramatically and blew a few rings of smoke in the airi smiled many a weird tale i had listened to over that selfsame table there must have been some kink in my personality that inspired confidence for i had been told stories that some men would have given years of their life to have heard and yet despite my love of the bizarre and the dangerous and my longing to explore far reaches of littleknown lands i had been doomed to a life of prosaic flat uneventful businessdo you happen to have heard of professor van allister asked bruceyou dont mean arthur van allisterthe same then youknowhimi should say so known him for years ever since he resigned as professor of chemistry at the college so he could have more time for his experiments why i even helped him choose the plans for that soundproof laboratory of his on the top floor of his home then he got so busy with his confounded experiments he couldnt find time to be chummyyou may recall prague that when we were in college together i used to dabble quite a bit in chemistryi nodded and bruce continuedabout four months ago i found myself out of a job van allister advertised for an assistant and i answered he remembered me from college days and i managed to convince him i knew enough about chemistry to warrant a trialhe had a young lady doing his secretarial worka miss marjorie purdy she was one of these strictattentiontobusiness types and as goodlooking as she was efficient she had been helping van allister a bit in his laboratory and i soon discovered she took a genuine interest in puttering around making experiments of her own indeed she spent nearly all her spare time with us in the laboratoryit was only natural that such companionship should result in a close friendship and it wasnt long before i began to depend on her to help me in difficult experiments when the professor was busy i never could seem to stump her that girl took to chemistry as a duck takes to waterabout two months ago van allister had the laboratory partitioned off and made a separate workroom for himself he told us that he was about to enter upon a series of experiments which if successful would bring him everlasting fame he flatly refused to make us his confidants in any way shape or mannerfrom that time on miss purdy and i were left alone more and more for days at a time the professor would retire to the seclusion of his new workshop sometimes not even appearing for his mealsthat meant too that we had more spare time on our hands our friendship ripened i felt a growing admiration for the trim young woman who seemed perfectly content to fuss around smelly bottles and sticky messes gowned in white from head to foot even to the rubber gloves she woreday before yesterday van allister invited us into his workshopat last i have achieved success he announced holding up for our inspection a small bottle containing a colorless liquid i have here what will rank as the greatest chemical discovery ever known i am going to prove its efficacy right before your eyes bruce will you bring me one of the rabbits pleasei went back into the other room and brought him one of the rabbits we kept together with guinea pigs for experimental purposeshe put the little animal into a small glass box just large enough to hold it and closed the cover then he set a glass funnel in a hole in the top of the box and we drew nearer to watch the experimenthe uncorked the bottle and poised it above the rabbits prisonnow to prove whether my weeks of effort have resulted in success or failureslowly methodically he emptied the contents of the bottle into the funnel and we watched it trickle into the compartment with the frightened animalmiss purdy uttered a suppressed cry and i rubbed my eyes to make sure that they had not deceived me for in the case where but a moment before there had been a live terrified rabbitthere was now nothing but a pile of soft white ashesprofessor van allister turned to us with an air of supreme satisfaction his face radiated ghoulish glee and his eyes were alight with a weird insane gleam when he spoke his voice took on a tone of masterybruceand you too miss purdyit has been your privilege to witness the first successful trial of a preparation that will revolutionize the world it will instantaneously reduce to a fine ash anything with which it comes into contact except glass just think what that means an army equipped with glass bombs filled with my compound could annihilate the world wood metal stone brickeverythingswept away before them leaving no more trace than the rabbit i have just experimented uponjust a pile of soft white ashesi glanced at miss purdy her face had gone as white as the apron she worewe watched van allister as he transferred all that was left of the bunny to a small bottle and neatly labeled it ill admit that i was suffering a mental chill myself by the time he dismissed me and we left him alone behind the tightly closed doors of his workshoponce safely outside miss purdys nerves gave way completely she reeled and would have fallen had i not caught her in my armsthe feel of her soft yielding body held close to my own was the last straw i cast prudence to the winds and crushed her tightly to my breast kiss after kiss i pressed upon her full red lips until her eyes opened and i saw the lovelight reflected in themafter a delicious eternity we came back to earth againlong enough to realize that the laboratory was no place for such ardent demonstrations at any moment van allister might come out of his retreat and if he should discover our lovemakingin his present state of mindwe dared not think of what might happenfor the rest of the day i was like a man in a dream its a wonder to me that i succeeded in accomplishing anything at all my body was merely an automaton a welltrained machine going about its appointed tasks while my mind soared into faraway realms of delightful daydreamingmarjorie kept busy with her secretarial work for the rest of the day and not once did i lay eyes upon her until my tasks in the laboratory were completedthat night we gave over to the joys of our newfound happiness prague i shall remember that night as long as i live the happiest moment i have ever known was when marjorie purdy promised to become my wifeyesterday was another day of unalloyed bliss all day long my sweetheart and i worked side by side then followed another night of lovemaking if youve never been in love with the only girl in the world prague you cant understand the delirious joy that comes from the very thought of her and marjorie returned my devotion a hundredfold she gave herself unreservedly into my keepingalong about noontime today i needed something to complete an experiment and i stepped over to the drug store for itwhen i returned i missed marjorie i looked for her hat and coat and they were gone the professor had not shown himself since the experiment upon the rabbit and was locked in his workshopi asked the servants but none of them had seen her leave the house nor had she left any message for meas the afternoon wore on i grew frantic evening came and still no sign of my dear little girlall thought of work was forgotten i paced the floor of my room like a caged lion every jangle of the phone or ring at the door bolstered up my faltering hopes of some word from her but each time i was doomed to disappointment each minute seemed an hour each hour an eternitygood god prague you cant imagine how i suffered from the heights of sublime love i mentally plunged to the darkest depths of despair i conjured visions of all sorts of terrible fates overtaking her still not a word did i hearit seemed to me that i had lived a lifetime but my watch told me it was only halfpast seven when the butler told me that van allister wanted me in the laboratoryi was in no mood for experiments but while i was under his roof he was my master and it was for me to obeythe professor was in his workshop the door slightly ajar he called to me to close the door of the laboratory and join him in the little roomin my present state of mind my brain photographed every minute detail of the scene which met my eyes in the center of the room on a marbletop table was a glass case about the shape and size of a coffin it was filled almost to the brim with that same colorless liquid which the small bottle had contained two days beforeat the left on a glasstop tabourette was a newly labeled glass jar i could not repress an involuntary shudder as i realized that it was filled with soft white ashes then i saw something that almost made my heart stop beatingon a chair in a far corner of the workshop was the hat and coat of the girl who had pledged her life to minethe girl whom i had vowed to cherish and protect while life should lastmy senses were numbed my soul surcharged with horror as realization flashed over me there could be but one explanationthe ashes in that jar were the ashes of marjorie purdythe world stood still for one long terrible moment and then i went madstark staring madthe next i can remember the professor and i were locked in a desperate struggle old as he was he still possessed a strength nearly equal to mine and he had the added advantage of calm selfpossessioncloser and closer he forced me to the glass coffin a few moments more and my ashes would join those of the girl i had loved i stumbled against the tabourette and my fingers closed over the jar of ashes with one last superhuman effort i raised it high above my head and brought it down with crushing force upon the skull of my antagonist his arm relaxed his limp form dropped in a senseless heap to the floorstill acting upon impulse i raised the silent form of the professor and carefully lest i should spill some of it on the floor lowered the body into the casket of deatha moment and it was over professor and liquid both were gone and in their place was a little pile of soft white ashesas i gazed at my handiwork the brainstorm passed away and i came face to face with the cold hard truth that i had killed a fellowbeing an unnatural calm possessed me i knew that there was not a single shred of evidence against me barring the fact that i was the last one known to be alone with the professor nothing remained but ashesi put on my hat and coat told the butler that the professor had left word he was not to be disturbed and that i was going out for the evening once outside all my selfpossession vanished my nerves were shot to pieces i dont know where i wentonly that i wandered aimlessly here and there until i found myself outside your apartment just a little while agoprague i felt as if i must talk with someone that i must unburden my tortured mind i knew that i could trust you old pal so ive told you the whole story here i amdo with me as you will life holds nothing more for me now thatmarjorieis gonebruces voice trembled with emotion and broke as he mentioned the name of the girl he lovedi leaned across the table and gazed searchingly into the eyes of the abject figure that slouched dejectedly in the big chair then i rose put on my hat and coat crossed to bruce who had buried his head in his hands and was shaking with silent sobsbrucemalcolm bruce raised his eyesbruce listen to meare you sure marjorie purdy is deadam i sure that his eyes widened at the suggestion and he sat erect with a sudden startexactly i went on are you positive that the ashes in that jar were the ashes of marjorie purdywhyisee here prague what are you driving atthen yourenotsure you saw the girls hat and coat in that chair and in your state of mind you jumped at conclusions the ashes must be those of the missing girl the professor must have made away with her and all that come now did van allistertellyou anythingi dont know what he said i tell you i wentberserkmadthen you come along with me if shes not dead she must be somewhere in that house and if sheisthere were going to find heron the street we hailed a taxi and in a few moments the butler admitted us to van allisters home bruce let us into the laboratory with his key the door of the workshop was still ajarmy eyes swept the room in a comprehensive survey at the left over near the window was a closed door i strode across the room and tried the knob but it refused to yieldwhere does that leadjust an anteroom where the professor keeps his apparatusall the same that doors coming open i returned grimly stepping back a pace or two i planted a welldirected kick upon the door another and still another and the framework around the lock gave waybruce with an inarticulate cry sped across the room to a huge mahogany chest he selected one of the keys on his ring inserted it in the lock and flung back the cover with trembling handshere she is praguequick get her out where theres airtogether we bore the limp figure of the girl into the laboratory bruce hastily mixed a concoction which he forced between her lips a second dose and her eyes slowly openedher bewildered glance traveled around the room at last resting on bruce and her eyes lighted with sudden happy recognition later after the first few moments of reunion the girl told us her storyafter malcolm went out this afternoon the professor sent word to me to come into the workshop as he often summoned me to do some errand or other i thought nothing of it and to save time took my hat and coat along he closed the door of the little room and without warning attacked me from behind he overpowered me tied me hand and foot it was needless to gag me as you know the laboratory is absolutely soundproofthen he produced a huge newfoundland dog he had secured from somewhere or other reduced it to ashes before my very eyes and put the ashes in a glass jar that was on a tabourette in the workshophe went into the anteroom and from the chest where you found me took out the glass casket at least it seemed a casket to my terrorstricken eyes he mixed enough of his horrible liquid to fill it almost to the brimthen he told me that but one thing remained that wasto perform the experiment upon a human being she shuddered at the recollection he dilated at length upon what a privilege it would be for anyone to sacrifice his life in such a manner for such a cause then he calmly informed me that he had selected you as the subject of his experiment and that i was to play the role of witness i faintedthe professor must have feared some sort of intrusion for the next i remember is waking inside the chest where you discovered me it was stifling every breath i took came harder and harder i thought of you malcolmthought of the wonderful happy hours we had spent together the last few days i wondered what i would do when you were gone i even prayed that he would kill me too my throat grew parched and dryeverything went black before my eyesnext i opened them to find myself herewith you malcolm her voice sank to a hoarse nervous whisper wherewhere is the professorbruce silently led her into the workshop she shivered as the coffin of glass came within her range of vision still silently he crossed directly to the casket and taking up a handful of the soft white ashes let them sift slowly through his fingers,1
ii am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why it is altogether against my will that i tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarcticwith its vast fossilhunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient icecapand i am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain doubt of the real facts as i must reveal them is inevitable yet if i suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left the hitherto withheld photographs both ordinary and arial will count in my favour for they are damnably vivid and graphic still they will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried the ink drawings of course will be jeered at as obvious impostures notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle overin the end i must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have on the one hand sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling mythcycles and on the other hand sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and overambitious programme in the region of those mountains of madness it is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates connected only with a small university have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly controversial nature are concernedit is further against us that we are not in the strictest sense specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned as a geologist my object in leading the miskatonic university expedition was wholly that of securing deeplevel specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent aided by the remarkable drill devised by prof frank h pabodie of our engineering department i had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this but i did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection pabodies drilling apparatus as the public already knows from our reports was unique and radical in its lightness portability and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness steel head jointed rods gasoline

especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added fuelwarming and quickstarting devices worked out by pabodie could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve uswe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic seasonor longer if absolutely necessarywould permit operating mostly in the mountainranges and on the plateau south of ross sea regions explored in varying degree by shackleton amundsen scott and byrd with frequent changes of camp made by aroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material especially in the precambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously been secured we wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks since the primal lifehistory of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earths past that the antarctic continent was once temperate and even tropical with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens marine fauna arachnida and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals is a matter of common information and we hoped to expand that information in variety accuracy and detail when a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs we would enlarge the aperture by blasting in order to get specimens of suitable size and conditionour borings of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock were to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfacesthese inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or twomile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels we could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of mere glaciation though pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasolinedriven dynamo it is this planwhich we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as oursthat the coming starkweathermoore expedition proposes to follow despite the warnings i have issued since our return from the antarcticthe public knows of the miskatonic expedition through our frequent wireless reports to thearkham advertiserand associated press and through the later articles of pabodie and myself we consisted of four men from the universitypabodie lake of the biology department atwood of the physics department also a meteorologist and i representing geology and having nominal commandbesides sixteen assistants seven graduate students from miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics of these sixteen twelve were qualified aroplane pilots all but two of whom were competent wireless operators eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant as did pabodie atwood and i in addition of course our two shipswooden exwhalers reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary steamwere fully manned the nathaniel derby pickman foundation aided by a few special contributions financed the expedition hence our preparations were extremely thorough despite the absence of great publicity the dogs sledges machines camp materials and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in boston and there our ships were loaded we were marvellously wellequipped for our specific purposes and in all matters pertaining to supplies regimen transportation and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors it was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expeditionample though it wasso little noticed by the world at largeas the newspapers told we sailed from boston harbour on september 2 1930 taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the panama canal and stopping at samoa and hobart tasmania at which latter place we took on final supplies none of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before hence we all relied greatly on our ship captainsj b douglas commanding the brigarkhamand serving as commander of the sea party and georg thorfinnssen commanding the barquemiskatonicboth veteran whalers in antarctic waters as we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in the north and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day at about 62 south latitude we sighted our first icebergstablelike objects with vertical sidesand just before reaching the antarctic circle which we crossed on october 20 with appropriately quaint ceremonies we were considerably troubled with field ice the falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics but i tried to brace up for the worse rigours to come on many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly these including a strikingly vivid miragethe first i had ever seenin which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castlespushing through the ice which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed we regained open water at south latitude 67 east longitude 175 on the morning of october 26 a strong land blink appeared on the south and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast lofty and snowclad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead at last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death these peaks were obviously the admiralty range discovered by ross and it would now be our task to round cape adare and sail down the east coast of victoria land to our contemplated base on the shore of mcmurdo sound at the foot of the volcano erebus in south latitude 77 9the last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancystirring great barren peaks of mystery looming up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizongrazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow bluish ice and water lanes and black bits of exposed granite slope through the desolate summits swept raging intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and halfsentient musical piping with notes extending over a wide range and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing asian paintings of nicholas roerich and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of leng which occur in the dreadednecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred i was rather sorry later on that i had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college libraryon the seventh of november sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost we passed franklin island and the next day descried the cones of mts erebus and terror on ross island ahead with the long line of the parry mountains beyond there now stretched off to the east the low white line of the great ice barrier rising perpendicularly to a height of 200 feet like the rocky cliffs of quebec and marking the end of southward navigation in the afternoon we entered mcmurdo sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking mt erebus the scoriac peak towered up some 12700 feet against the eastern sky like a japanese print of the sacred fujiyama while beyond it rose the white ghostlike height of mt terror 10900 feet in altitude and now extinct as a volcano puffs of smoke from erebus came intermittently and one of the graduate assistantsa brilliant young fellow named danforthpointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope remarking that this mountain discovered in 1840 had undoubtedly been the source of poes image when he wrote seven years later ofthe lavas that restlessly rolltheir sulphurous currents down yaanekin the ultimate climes of the polethat groan as they roll down mount yaanekin the realms of the boreal poledanforth was a great reader of bizarre material and had talked a good deal of poe i was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of poes only long storythe disturbing and enigmaticalarthur gordon pymon the barren shore and on the lofty ice barrier in the background myriads of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins while many fat seals were visible on the water swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting iceusing small boats we effected a difficult landing on ross island shortly after midnight on the morning of the 9th carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breechesbuoy arrangement our sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and complex even though at this particular point the scott and shackleton expeditions had preceded us our camp on the frozen shore below the volcanos slope was only a provisional one headquarters being kept aboard thearkhamwe landed all our drilling apparatus dogs sledges tents provisions gasoline tanks experimental icemelting outfit cameras both ordinary and arial aroplane parts and other accessories including three small portable wireless outfits besides those in the planes capable of communicating with thearkhamslarge outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit the ships outfit communicating with the outside world was to convey press reports to thearkham advertiserspowerful wireless station on kingsport head mass we hoped to complete our work during a single antarctic summer but if this proved impossible we would winter on thearkhamsending themiskatonicnorth before the freezing of the ice for another summers suppliesi need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work of our ascent of mt erebus our successful mineral borings at several points on ross island and the singular speed with which pabodies apparatus accomplished them even through solid rock layers our provisional test of the small icemelting equipment our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies and our final assembling of five huge aroplanes at the camp atop the barrier the health of our land partytwenty men and 55 alaskan sledge dogswas remarkable though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms for the most part the thermometer varied between zero and 20 or 25 above and our experience with new england winters had accustomed us to rigours of this sort the barrier camp was semipermanent and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline provisions dynamite and other supplies only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from thearkhamin case all our exploring planes were lost later when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from 600 to 700 miles southward beyond beardmore glacier despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau we determined to dispense with intermediate bases taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiencywireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking fourhour nonstop flight of our squadron on november 21 over the lofty shelf ice with vast peaks rising on the west and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines wind troubled us only moderately and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered when the vast rise loomed ahead between latitudes 83 and 84 we knew we had reached beardmore glacier the largest valley glacier in the world and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coastline at last we were truly entering the white aeondead world of the ultimate south and even as we realised it we saw the peak of mt nansen in the eastern distance towering up to its height of almost 15000 feetthe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in latitude 86 7 east longitude 174 23 and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short aroplane flights are matters of history as is the arduous and triumphant ascent of mt nansen by pabodie and two of the graduate studentsgedney and carrollon december 1315 we were some 8500 feet above sealevel and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens the precambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous with the great bulk of the continent to the west but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below south americawhich we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of ross and weddell seas though byrd has since disproved the hypothesisin certain of the sandstones dynamited and chiselled after boring revealed their nature we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragmentsnotably ferns seaweeds trilobites crinoids and such molluscs as lingulae and gasteropodsall of which seemed of real significance in connexion with the regions primordial history there was also a queer triangular striated marking about a foot in greatest diameter which lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deepblasted aperture these fragments came from a point to the westward near the queen alexandra range and lake as a biologist seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist i saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depressionon january 6 1931 lake pabodie danforth all six of the students four mechanics and i flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes being forced down once by a sudden high wind which fortunately did not develop into a typical storm this was as the papers have stated one of several observation flights during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold silver and scarlet land of dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun on cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the twoat length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying 500 miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh subbase at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division as we mistakenly conceived it geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison our health so far had remained excellent limejuice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs it was now midsummer and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by march and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west but we had escaped damage through the skill of atwood in devising rudimentary aroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks and reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncannythe outside world knew of course of our programme and was told also of lakes strange and dogged insistence on a westwardor rather northwestwardprospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base it seems he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical daring over that triangular striated marking in the slate reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the weststretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged he was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky unknown and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a datecambrian if not actually precambrianas to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage these fragments with their odd marking must have been 500 million to a thousand million years oldiipopular imagination i judge responded actively to our wireless bulletins of lakes start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionising the entire sciences of biology and geology his preliminary sledging and boring journey of january 1118 with pabodie and five othersmarred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressureridges in the icehad brought up more and more of the archaean slate and even i was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum these markings however were of very primitive lifeforms involving no great paradox except that any lifeforms should occur in rock as definitely precambrian as this seemed to be hence i still failed to see the good sense of lakes demand for an interlude in our timesaving programmean interlude requiring the use of all four planes many men and the whole of the expeditions mechanical apparatus i did not in the end veto the plan though i decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite lakes plea for my geological advice while they were gone i would remain at the base with pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift in preparation for this transfer one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from mcmurdo sound but this could wait temporarily i kept with me one sledge and nine dogs since it is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeonlong deathlakes subexpedition into the unknown as everyone will recall sent out its own reports from the shortwave transmitters on the planes these being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by thearkhamat mcmurdo sound whence they were relayed to the outside world on wavelengths up to fifty metres the start was made january 22 at 4 am and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later when lake spoke of descending and starting a smallscale icemelting and bore at a point some 300 miles away from us six hours after that a second and very excited message told of the frantic beaverlike work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original puzzlementthree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale and when i despatched a message of protest against further hazards lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking i saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny and that i could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expeditions success but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests and unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some 1500 miles to the halfknown halfsuspected coastline of queen mary and knox landsthen in about an hour and a half more came that doubly excited message from lakes moving plane which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish i had accompanied the party1005 pm on the wing after snowstorm have spied mountainrange ahead higher than any hitherto seen may equal himalayas allowing for height of plateau probable latitude 76 15 longitude 113 10 e reaches far as can see to right and left suspicion of two smoking cones all peaks black and bare of snow gale blowing off them impedes navigationafter that pabodie the men and i hung breathlessly over the receiver thought of this titanic mountain rampart 700 miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure and we rejoiced that our expedition if not ourselves personally had been its discoverers in half an hour lake called us againmoultons plane forced down on plateau in foothills but nobody hurt and perhaps can repair shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further moves if necessary but no more heavy plane travel needed just now mountains surpass anything in imagination am going up scouting in carrolls plane with all weight out you cant imagine anything like this highest peaks must go over 35000 feet everest out of the running atwood to work out height with theodolite while carroll and i go up probably wrong about cones for formations look stratified possibly precambrian slate with other strata mixed in queer skyline effectsregular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks whole thing marvellous in redgold light of low sun like land of mystery in a dream or gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder wish you were here to studythough it was technically sleepingtime not one of us listeners thought for a moment of retiring it must have been a good deal the same at mcmurdo sound where the supply cache and thearkhamwere also getting the messages for capt douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find and sherman the cache operator seconded his sentiments we were sorry of course about the damaged aroplane but hoped it could be easily mended then at 11 pm came another call from lakeup with carroll over highest foothills dont dare try really tall peaks in present weather but shall later frightful work climbing and hard going at this altitude but worth it great range fairly solid hence cant get any glimpses beyond main summits exceed himalayas and very queer range looks like precambrian slate with plain signs of many other upheaved strata was wrong about volcanism goes farther in either direction than we can see swept clear of snow above about 21000 feet odd formations on slopes of highest mountains great low square blocks with exactly vertical sides and rectangular lines of low vertical ramparts like the old asian castles clinging to steep mountains in roerichs paintings impressive from distance flew close to some and carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate pieces but that is probably weathering most edges crumbled and rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years parts especially upper parts seem to be of lightercoloured rock than any visible strata on slopes proper hence an evidently crystalline origin close flying shews many cavemouths some unusually regular in outline square or semicircular you must come and investigate think i saw rampart squarely on top of one peak height seems about 30000 to 35000 feet am up 21500 myself in devilish gnawing cold wind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves but no flying danger so farfrom then on for another halfhour lake kept up a running fire of comment and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on foot i replied that i would join him as soon as he could send a plane and that pabodie and i would work out the best gasoline planjust where and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expeditions altered character obviously lakes boring operations as well as his aroplane activities would need a great deal delivered for the new base which he was to establish at the foot of the mountains and it was possible that the eastward flight might not be made after all this season in connexion with this business i called capt douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the single dogteam we had left there a direct route across the unknown region between lake and mcmurdo sound was what we really ought to establishlake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where moultons plane had been forced down and where repairs had already progressed somewhat the icesheet was very thin with dark ground here and there visible and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions he spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene and the queer state of his sensations at being in the lee of vast silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the worlds rim atwoods theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from 30000 to 34000 feet the windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed lake for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales violent beyond anything we had so far encountered his camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher foothills abruptly rose i could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his wordsflashed across a glacial void of 700 milesas he urged that we all hasten with the matter and get the strange new region disposed of as soon as possible he was about to rest now after a continuous days work of almost unparalleled speed strenuousness and resultsin the morning i had a threecornered wireless talk with lake and capt douglas at their widely separated bases and it was agreed that one of lakes planes would come to my base for pabodie the five men and myself as well as for all the fuel it could carry the rest of the fuel question depending on our decision about an easterly trip could wait for a few days since lake had enough for immediate camp heat and borings eventually the old southern base ought to be restocked but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer and meanwhile lake must send a plane to explore a direct route between his new mountains and mcmurdo soundpabodie and i prepared to close our base for a short or long period as the case might be if we wintered in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from lakes base to thearkhamwithout returning to this spot some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow and now we decided to complete the job of making a permanent esquimau village owing to a very liberal tent supply lake had with him all that his base would need even after our arrival i wirelessed that pabodie and i would be ready for the northwestward move after one days work and one nights restour labours however were not very steady after 4 pm for about that time lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages his working day had started unpropitiously since an aroplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces shewed an entire absence of those archaean and primordial strata for which he was looking and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that loomed up at a tantalising distance from the camp most of the rocks glimpsed were apparently jurassic and comanchian sandstones and permian and triassic schists with now and then a glossy black outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal this rather discouraged lake whose plans all hinged on unearthing specimens more than 500 million years older it was clear to him that in order to recover the archaean slate vein in which he had found the odd markings he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselveshe had resolved nevertheless to do some local boring as part of the expeditions general programme hence set up the drill and put five men to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aroplane the softest visible rocka sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camphad been chosen for the first sampling and the drill made excellent progress without much supplementary blasting it was about three hours afterward following the first really heavy blast of the operation that the shouting of the drill crew was heard and that young gedneythe acting foremanrushed into the camp with the startling newsthey had struck a cave early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of comanchian limestone full of minute fossil cephalopods corals echini and spirifera and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bonesthe latter probably of teliosts sharks and ganoids this in itself was important enough as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured but when shortly afterward the drillhead dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators a goodsized blast had laid open the subterrene secret and now through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet thick there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic worldthe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh slightly moving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean system its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites some of which met in columnar form but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones which in places nearly choked the passage washed down from unknown jungles of mesozoic treeferns and fungi and forests of tertiary cycads fanpalms and primitive angiosperms this osseous medley contained representatives of more cretaceous eocene and other animal species than the greatest palaeontologist could have counted or classified in a year molluscs crustacean armour fishes amphibians reptiles birds and early mammalsgreat and small known and unknown no wonder gedney ran back to the camp shouting and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a newfound gateway to secrets of inner earth and vanished aeonswhen lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he scribbled a message in his notebook and had young moulton run back to the camp to despatch it by wireless this was my first word of the discovery and it told of the identification of early shells bones of ganoids and placoderms remnants of labyrinthodonts and thecodonts great mososaur skull fragments dinosaur vertebrae and armourplates pterodactyl teeth and wingbones archaeopteryx debris miocene sharks teeth primitive birdskulls and skulls vertebrae and other bones of archaic mammals such as palaeotheres xiphodons dinocerases eohippi oreodons and titanotheres there was nothing as recent as a mastodon elephant true camel deer or bovine animal hence lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the oligocene age and that the hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried dead and inaccessible state for at least thirty million yearson the other hand the prevalence of very early lifeforms was singular in the highest degree though the limestone formation was on the evidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites positively and unmistakably comanchian and not a particle earlier the free fragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periodseven rudimentary fishes molluscs and corals as remote as the silurian or ordovician the inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of over 300 million years ago and that of only thirty million years ago how far this continuity had extended beyond the oligocene age when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation in any event the coming of the frightful ice in the pleistocene some 500000 years agoa mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavitymust have put an end to any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common termslake was not content to let his first message stand but had another bulletin written and despatched across the snow to the camp before moulton could get back after that moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes transmitting to meand to thearkhamfor relaying to the outside worldthe frequent postscripts which lake sent him by a succession of messengers those who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created among men of science by that afternoons reportsreports which have finally led after all these years to the organisation of that very starkweathermoore expedition which i am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes i had better give the messages literally as lake sent them and as our base operator mctighe translated them from his pencil shorthandfowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone fragments from blasts several distinct triangular striated prints like those in archaean slate proving that source survived from over 600 million years ago to comanchian times without more than moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size comanchian prints apparently more primitive or decadent if anything than older ones emphasise importance of discovery in press will mean to biology what einstein has meant to mathematics and physics joins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions appears to indicate as i suspected that earth has seen whole cycle or cycles of organic life before known one that begins with archaeozoic cells was evolved and specialised not later than thousand million years ago when planet was young and recently uninhabitable for any

later job now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp without dogs which bark furiously and cant be trusted near them with nine menthree left to guard the dogswe ought to manage the three sledges fairly well though wind is bad must establish plane communication with mcmurdo sound and begin shipping material but ive got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest wish i had a real laboratory here dyer better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip first the worlds greatest mountains and then this if this last isnt the high spot of the expedition i dont know what is were made scientifically congrats pabodie on the drill that opened up the cave now willarkhamplease repeat descriptionthe sensations of pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description nor were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm mctighe who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the droning receiving set wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version as soon as lakes operator signed off all appreciated the epochmaking significance of the discovery and i sent lake congratulations as soon as thearkhamsoperator had repeated back the descriptive parts as requested and my example was followed by sherman from his station at the mcmurdo sound supply cache as well as by capt douglas of thearkhamlater as head of the expedition i added some remarks to be relayed through thearkhamto the outside world of course rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement and my only wish was to get to lakes camp as quickly as i could it disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early arial travel impossiblebut within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment lake was sending more messages and told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp it had been a hard pull for the things were surprisingly heavy but nine men had accomplished it very neatly now some of the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding the specimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp save for one on which lake was making crude attempts at dissectionthis dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected for despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen specimena powerful and intact onelost nothing of their more than leathery toughness lake was puzzled as to how he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the structural niceties he was looking for he had it is true seven more perfect specimens but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited supply accordingly he removed the specimen and dragged in one which though having remnants of the starfisharrangements at both ends was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrowsresults quickly reported over the wireless were baffling and provocative indeed nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered existing biology would have to be wholly revised for this thing was no product of any cellgrowth science knows about there had been scarcely any mineral replacement and despite an age of perhaps forty million years the internal organs were wholly intact the leathery undeteriorative and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the things form of organisation and pertained to some palaeogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation at first all that lake found was dry but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect organic moisture of pungent and offensive odour was encountered toward the things uninjured side it was not blood but a thick darkgreen fluid apparently answering the same purpose by the time lake reached this stage all 37 dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid diffusive smellfar from helping to place the strange entity this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery all guesses about its external members had been correct and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that lake was left hopelessly at sea it had digestion and circulation and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its starfishshaped base cursorily one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide and there were odd evidences of airstorage chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathingsystemsgills and pores clearly it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless hibernationperiods as well vocal organs seemed present in connexion with the main respiratory system but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution articulate speech in the sense of syllableutterance seemed barely conceivable but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable the muscular system was almost preternaturally developedthe nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave lake aghast though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects the thing had a set of ganglial centres and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialised development its fivelobed brain was surprisingly advanced and there were signs of a sensory equipment served in part through the wiry cilia of the head involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism probably it had more than five senses so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing analogy it must lake thought have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and delicately differentiated functions in its primal world much like the ants and bees of today it reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams especially the pteridophytes having sporecases at the tips of the wings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallusbut to give it a name at this stage was mere folly it looked like a radiate but was clearly something more it was partly vegetable but had threefourths of the essentials of animal structure that it was marine in origin its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its later adaptations the wings after all held a persistent suggestion of the arial how it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a newborn earth in time to leave prints in archaean rocks was so far beyond conception as to make lake whimsically recall the primal myths about great old ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earthlife as a joke or mistake and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by a folklorist colleague in miskatonics english departmentnaturally he considered the possibility of the precambrian prints having been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens but quickly rejected this too facile theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the older fossils if anything the later contours shewed decadence rather than higher evolution the size of the pseudofeet had decreased and the whole morphology seemed coarsened and simplified moreover the nerves and organs just examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more complex atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent altogether little could be said to have been solved and lake fell back on mythology for a provisional namejocosely dubbing his finds the elder onesat about 230 am having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin emerged from the laboratory tent and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest the ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle so that the headpoints and tubes of two or three shewed signs of unfolding but lake did not believe there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air he did however move all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays that would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs whose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters he had to weight down the corners of the tentcloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts early apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived and under atwoods supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents new dogcorral and crude aroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side these latter shelters begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments were by no means as high as they should have been and lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on themit was after four when lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher he held some friendly chat with pabodie over the ether and repeated his praise of the really marvellous drills that had helped him make his discovery atwood also sent greetings and praises i gave lake a warm word of congratulation owning up that he was right about the western trip and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning if the gale was then over lake would send a plane for the party at my base just before retiring i despatched a final message to thearkhamwith instructions about toning down the days news for the outside world since the full details seemed radical enough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiatediiinone of us i imagine slept very heavily or continuously that morning for both the excitement of lakes discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing so savage was the blast even where we were that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at lakes camp directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it mctighe was awake at ten oclock and tried to get lake on the wireless as agreed but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication we did however get thearkhamand douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach lake he had not known about the wind for very little was blowing at mcmurdo sound despite its persistent rage where we werethroughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get lake at intervals but invariably without results about noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded out of the west causing us to fear for the safety of our camp but it eventually died down with only a moderate relapse at 2 pm after three oclock it was very quiet and we redoubled our efforts to get lake reflecting that he had four planes each provided with an excellent shortwave outfit we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once nevertheless the stony silence continued and when we thought of the delirious force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the most direful conjecturesby six oclock our fears had become intense and definite and after a wireless consultation with douglas and thorfinnssen i resolved to take steps toward investigation the fifth aroplane which we had left at the mcmurdo sound supply cache with sherman and two sailors was in good shape and ready for instant use and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us i got sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible the air conditions being apparently highly favourable we then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party and decided that we would include all hands together with the sledge and dogs which i had kept with me even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our especial orders for heavy machinery transportation at intervals i still tried to reach lake with the wireless but all to no purposesherman with the sailors gunnarsson and larsen took off at 730 and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing they arrived at our base at midnight and all hands at once discussed the next move it was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a single aroplane without any line of bases but no one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity we turned in at two oclock for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane but were up again in four hours to finish the loading and packingat 715 am january 25th we started flying northwestward under mctighes pilotage with ten men seven dogs a sledge a fuel and food supply and other items including the planes wireless outfit the atmosphere was clear fairly quiet and relatively mild in temperature and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by lake as the site of his camp our apprehensions were over what we might find or fail to find at the end of our journey for silence continued to answer all calls despatched to the campevery incident of that fourandahalfhour flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial position in my life it marked my loss at the age of fiftyfour of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external nature and natures laws thenceforward the ten of usbut the student danforth and myself above all otherswere to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could the newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane telling of our nonstop course our two battles with treacherous upperair gales our glimpse of the broken surface where lake had sunk his midjourney shaft three days before and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snowcylinders noted by amundsen and byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau there came a point though when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand and a later point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorshipthe sailor larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles ahead and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane despite our speed they were very slow in gaining prominence hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off and visible only because of their abnormal height little by little however they rose grimly into the western sky allowing us to distinguish various bare bleak blackish summits and to catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent icedust clouds in the whole spectacle there was a persistent pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation as if these stark nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream and complex gulfs of remote time space and ultradimensionality i could not help feeling that they were evil thingsmountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss that seething halfluminous cloudbackground held ineffable suggestions of a vague etherealbeyondnessfar more than terrestrially spatial and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness separateness desolation and aeonlong death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral worldit was young danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skylineregularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes which lake had mentioned in his messages and which indeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial templeruins on cloudy asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by roerich there was indeed something hauntingly roerichlike about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery i had felt it in october when we first caught sight of victoria land and i felt it afresh now i felt too another wave of uneasy consciousness of archaean mythical resemblances of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of leng in the primal writings mythologists have placed leng in central asia but the racial memory of manor of his predecessorsis long and it may well be that certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than asia and earlier than any human world we know a few daring mystics have hinted at a prepleistocene origin for the fragmentary pnakotic manuscripts and have suggested that the devotees of tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as tsathoggua itself leng wherever in space or time it might brood was not a region i would care to be in or near nor did i relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and archaean monstrosities as those lake had just mentioned at the moment i felt sorry that i had ever read the abhorrednecronomiconor talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist wilmarth at the universitythis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills i had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism and i shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled icevapours above our headsthe effect was that of a cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination with vast aggregations of nightblack masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws and attaining the most grotesque extremes of sinister bizarrerie there were truncated cones sometimes terraced or fluted surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped discs and strange beetling tablelike constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or fivepointed stars with each one overlapping the one beneath there were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids and occasional needlelike spires in curious clusters of five all of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer giganticism the general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler scoresby in 1820 but at this time and place with those dark unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead that anomalous elderworld discovery in our minds and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portenti was glad when the mirage began to break up though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted temporary forms of even vaster hideousness as the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again and saw that our journeys end was not far off the unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a fieldglass we were over the lowest foothills now and could see amidst the snow ice and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be lakes camp and boring the higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than himalayan peaks beyond them at length ropesthe student who had relieved mctighe at the controlsbegan to head downward toward the lefthand dark spot whose size marked it as the camp as he did so mctighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expeditioneveryone of course has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day or of the night before that eleven known dead young gedney missing people pardoned our hazy lack of details through realisation of the shock the sad event must have caused us and believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside indeed i flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress utter bewilderment and soulclutching horror we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance the tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tellwhat i would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrorsit is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc whether all could have lived through it even without the other thing is gravely open to doubt the storm with its fury of madly driven iceparticles must have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before one aroplane shelterall it seems had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate statewas nearly pulverised and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces the exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking wooden surfaces left out in the blast were pitted and denuded of paint and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated it is also true that we found none of the archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole we did gather some minerals from a vast tumbled pile including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd fivepointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons and some fossil bones among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimensnone of the dogs survived their hurriedly built snow enclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed the wind may have done that though the greater breakage on the side next the camp which was not the windward one suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves all three sledges were gone and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown the drill and icemelting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which lake had blasted we likewise left at the camp the two most shakenup of the planes since our surviving party had only four real pilotssherman danforth mctighe and ropesin all with danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate we brought back all the books scientific equipment and other incidentals we could find though much was rather unaccountably blown away spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of conditionit was approximately 4 pm after wide plane cruising had forced us to give gedney up for lost that we sent our guarded message to thearkhamfor relaying and i think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing the most we said about agitation concerned our dogs whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor lakes accounts we did not mention i think their display of the same uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other objects in the disordered region objects including scientific instruments aroplanes and machinery both at the camp and at the boring whose parts had been loosened moved or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have harboured singular curiosity and investigativenessabout the fourteen biological specimens we were pardonably indefinite we said that the only ones we discovered were damaged but that enough was left of them to prove lakes description wholly and impressively accurate it was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this matterand we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find we had by that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of lakes men and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully buried upright in ninefoot snow graves under fivepointed mounds punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly like those on the queer greenish soapstones dug up from mesozoic or tertiary times the eight perfect specimens mentioned by lake seemed to have been completely blown awaywe were careful too about the publics general peace of mind hence danforth and i said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day it was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us on our return at 1 am danforth was close to hysterics but kept an admirably stiff upper lip it took no persuasion to make him promise not to shew our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside and to hide our camera films for private development later on so that part of my present story will be as new to pabodie mctighe ropes sherman and the rest as it will be to the world in general indeeddanforth is closer mouthed than i for he sawor thinks he sawone thing he will not tell even meas all know our report included a tale of a hard ascent a confirmation of lakes opinion that the great peaks are of archaean slate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle comanchian times a conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart formations a decision that the cavemouths indicate dissolved calcareous veins a conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers and a remark that the mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the mountains themselves20000 feet in elevation with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer precipices of the highest peaksthis body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes and it completely satisfied the men at the camp we laid our absence of sixteen hoursa longer time than our announced flying landing reconnoitring and rockcollecting programme called forto a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions and told truly of our landing on the farther foothills fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our flight had any tried to do that i would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop themand i do not know what danforth would have done while we were gone pabodie sherman ropes mctighe and williamson had worked like beavers over lakes two best planes fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanismwe decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base as soon as possible even though indirect that was the safest way to work toward mcmurdo sound for a straightline flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the aeondead continent would involve many additional hazards further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery and the doubts and horrors around uswhich we did not revealmade us wish only to escape from this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we couldas the public knows our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters all planes reached the old base on the evening of the next dayjanuary 27thafter a swift nonstop flight and on the 28th we made mcmurdo sound in two laps the one pause being very brief and occasioned by a faulty rudder in the furious wind over the iceshelf after we had cleared the great plateau in five days more thearkhamandmiskatonicwith all hands and equipment on board were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working up ross sea with the mocking mountains of victoria land looming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the winds wails into a wideranged musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted accursed realm where life and death space and time have made black and blasphemous alliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on the planets scarcecooled crustsince our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic exploration and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with splendid unity and faithfulness even young danforth with his nervous breakdown has not flinched or babbled to his doctorsindeed as i have said there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me though i think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so it might explain and relieve much though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock that is the impression i gather after those rare irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to methings which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself againit will be hard work deterring others from the great white south and some of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice we might have known from the first that human curiosity is undying and that the results we announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same agelong pursuit of the unknown lakes reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and palaeontologists to the highest pitch though we were sensible enough not to shew the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried specimens or our photographs of those specimens as they were found we also refrained from shewing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones while danforth and i have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across the range and the crumpled things we smoothed studied in terror and brought away in our pockets but now that starkweathermoore party is organising and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted if not dissuaded they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that which may end the world we know so i must break through all reticences at lasteven about that ultimate nameless thing beyond the mountains of madnessivit is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that i let my mind go back to lakes camp and what we really found thereand to that other thing beyond the frightful mountain wall i am constantly tempted to shirk the details and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions i hope i have said enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest the rest that is of the horror at the camp i have told of the windravaged terrain the damaged shelters the disarranged machinery the varied uneasinesses of our dogs the missing sledges and other items the deaths of men and dogs the absence of gedney and the six insanely buried biological specimens strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries from a world forty million years dead i do not recall whether i mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing we did not think much about that till laterindeed only danforth and i have thought of it at allthe principal things i have been keeping back relate to the bodies and to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos at the time i tried to keep the mens minds off those points for it was so much simplerso much more normalto lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of lakes party from the look of things that daemon mountain wind must have been enough to drive any man mad in the midst of this centre of all earthly mystery and desolationthe crowning abnormality of course was the condition of the bodiesmen and dogs alike they had all been in some terrible kind of conflict and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways death so far as we could judge had in each case come from strangulation or laceration the dogs had evidently started the trouble for the state of their illbuilt corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within it had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish archaean organisms but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain when left alone in that monstrous wind behind flimsy walls of insufficient height they must have stampededwhether from the wind itself or from some subtle increasing odour emitted by the nightmare specimens one could not say those specimens of course had been covered with a tentcloth yet the low antarctic sun had beat steadily upon that cloth and lake had mentioned that solar heat tended to make the strangely sound and tough tissues of the things relax and expand perhaps the wind had whipped the cloth from over them and jostled them about in such a way that their more pungent olfactory qualities became manifest despite their unbelievable antiquitybut whatever had happened it was hideous and revolting enough perhaps i had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at lastthough with a categorical statement of opinion based on the firsthand observations and most rigid deductions of both danforth and myself that the then missing gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found i have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled now i must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious coldblooded and inhuman fashion it was the same with dogs and men all the healthier fatter bodies quadrupedal or bipedal had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed as by a careful butcher and around them was a strange sprinkling of salttaken from the ravaged provisionchests on the planeswhich conjured up the most horrible associations the thing had occurred in one of the crude aroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory scattered bits of clothing roughly slashed from the human incisionsubjects hinted no clues it is useless to bring up the halfimpression of certain faint snowprints in one shielded corner of the ruined enclosurebecause that impression did not concern human prints at all but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks one had to be careful of ones imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madnessas i have indicated gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end when we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent which we entered after investigating the monstrous graves had something to reveal it was not as lake had left it for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table indeed we had already realised that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had foundthe one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful odourmust represent the collected sections of the entity which lake had tried to analyse on and around that laboratory table were strown other things and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog i shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the mans identity lakes anatomical instruments were missing but there were evidences of their careful cleansing the gasoline stove was also gone though around it we found a curious litter of matches we buried the human parts beside the other ten men and the canine parts with the other 35 dogs concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory table and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered near it we were much too bewildered to speculatethis formed the worst of the camp horror but other things were equally perplexing the disappearance of gedney the one dog the eight uninjured biological specimens the three sledges and certain instruments illustrated technical and scientific books writing materials electric torches and batteries food and fuel heating apparatus spare tents fur suits and the like was utterly beyond sane conjecture as were likewise the spatterfringed inkblots on certain pieces of paper and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the boring the dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery then too there was the upsetting of the larder the disappearance of certain staples and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places the profusion of scattered matches intact broken or spent formed another minor enigma as did the two or three tentcloths and fur suits which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations the maltreatment of the human and canine bodies and the crazy burial of the damaged archaean specimens were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness in view of just such an eventuality as the present one we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed starkweathermoore expeditionour first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open the row of insane graves with the fivepointed snow mounds we could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds with their clusters of grouped dots to poor lakes descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close indeed the whole general formation it must be made clear seemed abominably suggestive of the starfishhead of the archaean entities and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitised minds of lakes overwrought party our own first sight of the actual buried entities formed a horrible moment and sent the imaginations of pabodie and myself back to some of the shocking primal myths we had read and heard we all agreed that the mere sight and continued presence of the things must have coperated with the oppressive polar solitude and daemon mountain wind in driving lakes party madfor madnesscentring in gedney as the only possible surviving agentwas the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned though i will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have harboured wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely sherman pabodie and mctighe made an exhaustive aroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon sweeping the horizon with fieldglasses in quest of gedney and of the various missing things but nothing came to light the party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike without any diminution in height or essential structure on some of the peaks though the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer having doubly fantastic similitudes to roerichpainted asian hill ruins the distribution of cryptical cavemouths on the black snowdenuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be tracedin spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer scientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those mysterious mountains as our guarded messages stated we rested at midnight after our day of terror and bafflement but not without a tentative plan for one or more rangecrossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with arial camera and geologists outfit beginning the following morning it was decided that danforth and i try it first and we awaked at 7 am intending an early trip though heavy windsmentioned in our brief bulletin to the outside worlddelayed our start till nearly nine oclocki have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at campand relayed outsideafter our return sixteen hours later it is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in the hidden transmontane worldhints of the revelations which have finally driven danforth to a nervous collapse i wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks he alone saweven though it was probably a nervous delusionand which was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is but he is firm against that all i can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the windtortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which i shared this will form my last word if the plain signs of surviving elder horrors in what i disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the inner antarcticor at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman aeoncursed desolationthe responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immensurable evils will not be minedanforth and i studying the notes made by pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant had calculated that the lowest available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us within sight of camp and about 23000 or 24000 feet above sealevel for this point then we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery the camp itself on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau was some 12000 feet in altitude hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose for on account of visibility conditions we had to leave the cabin windows open we were dressed of course in our heaviest fursas we drew near the forbidding peaks dark and sinister above the line of crevasseriven snow and interstitial glaciers we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes and thought again of the strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich the ancient and windweathered rock strata fully verified all of lakes bulletins and proved that these hoary pinnacles had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earths historyperhaps over fifty million years how much higher they had once been it was futile to guess but everything about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavourable to change and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegrationbut it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes ramparts and cavemouths which fascinated and disturbed us most i studied them with a fieldglass and took arial photographs whilst danforth drove and at times relieved him at the controlsthough my aviation knowledge was purely an amateursin order to let him use the binoculars we could easily see that much of the material of the things was a lightish archaean quartzite unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor lake had scarcely hintedas he had said their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration many parts especially those closest to the slopes seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface the whole arrangement looked like the ruins of machu picchu in the andes or the primal foundationwalls of kish as dug up by the oxfordfield museum expedition in 1929 and both danforth and i obtained that occasional impression ofseparate cyclopean blockswhich lake had attributed to his flightcompanion carroll how to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me and i felt queerly humbled as a geologist igneous formations often have strange regularitieslike the famous giants causeway in irelandbut this stupendous range despite lakes original suspicion of smoking cones was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structurethe curious cavemouths near which the odd formations seemed most abundant presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline they were as lakes bulletin had said often approximately square or semicircular as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites outside those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular and danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrositieswe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected as we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a scott a shackleton or an amundsen some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to windbared passes with unusual continuity and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exceptionour sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed the touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic associationa thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes even the winds burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cavemouths there was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressionswe were now after a slow ascent at a height of 23570 feet according to the aneroid and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us up here were only dark bare rock slopes and the start of roughribbed glaciersbut with those provocative cubes ramparts and echoing cavemouths to add a portent of the unnatural the fantastic and the dreamlike looking along the line of high peaks i thought i could see the one mentioned by poor lake with a rampart exactly on top it seemed to be halflost in a queer antarctic haze such a haze perhaps as had been responsible for lakes early notion of volcanism the pass loomed directly before us smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapours and lighted by the low polar sunthe sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazeda few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm danforth and i unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines exchanged eloquent glances and then having gained those last few feet we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earthvi think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe wonder terror and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond of course we must have had some natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment probably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the garden of the gods in colorado or the fantastically symmetrical windcarved rocks of the arizona desert perhaps we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness we must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless tempestscarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal regular and geometrically eurhythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest and in places obviously thinnerthe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable for some fiendish violation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset here on a hellishly ancient tableland fully 20000 feet high and in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less than 500000 years ago there stretched nearly to the visions limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental selfdefence could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and artificial cause we had previously dismissed so far as serious thought was concerned any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin how could they be otherwise when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial deathyet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken for this cyclopean maze of squared curved and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge it was very clearly the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark objective and ineluctable reality that damnable portent had had a material basis after allthere had been some horizontal stratum of icedust in the upper air and this shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection of course the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated and had contained things which the real source did not contain yet now as we saw that real source we thought it even more hideous and menacing than its distant imageonly the incredible unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousandsperhaps millionsof years it had brooded there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland corona mundi roof of the world all sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle i thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic worldof the daemoniac plateau of leng of the migo or abominable snowmen of the himalayas of the pnakotic manuscripts with their prehuman implications of the cthulhu cult of thenecronomiconand of the hyperborean legends of formless tsathoggua and the worse than formless starspawn associated with that semientityfor boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning indeed as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through which we had come we had merely struck at random a limited part of something of incalculable extent the foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts these latter as well as the queer cavemouths were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the mountainsthe nameless stone labyrinth consisted for the most part of walls from 10 to 150 feet in iceclear height and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet it was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate schist and sandstoneblocks in many cases as large as 4 6 8 feetthough in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid uneven bedrock of precambrian slate the buildings were far from equal in size there being innumerable honeycombarrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate structures the general shape of these things tended to be conical pyramidal or terraced though there were many perfect cylinders perfect cubes clusters of cubes and other rectangular forms and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose fivepointed ground plan roughly suggested modern fortifications the builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of the arch and domes had probably existed in the citys heydaythe whole tangle was monstrously weathered and the glacial surface from which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the gigantic piles and noticed the icepreserved stone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances above the ground on the exposed walls we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed closer inspection revealed countless largish windows some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion many of the ruins of course were roofless and with uneven though windrounded upper edges whilst others of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and pitting with the fieldglass we could barely make out what seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bandsdecorations including those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now assumed a vastly larger significancein many places the buildings were totally ruined and the icesheet deeply riven from various geologic causes in other places the stonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation one broad swath extending from the plateaus interior to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed was wholly free from buildings and probably represented we concluded the course of some great river which in tertiary timesmillions of years agohad poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean abyss of the great barrier range certainly this was above all a region of caves gulfs and underground secrets beyond human penetrationlooking back to our sensations and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from aeons we had thought prehuman i can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did of course we knew that somethingchronology scientific theory or our own consciousnesswas woefully awry yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane observe many things quite minutely and take a careful series of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good stead in my case ingrained scientific habit may have helped for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this ageold secretto know what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place and what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a concentration of life could have hadfor this place could be no ordinary city it must have formed the primary nucleus and centre of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earths history whose outward ramifications recalled only dimly in the most obscure and distorted myths had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom here sprawled a palaeogean megalopolis compared with which the fabled atlantis and lemuria commoriom and uzuldaroum and olatho in the land of lomar are recent things of todaynot even of yesterday a megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as valusia rlyeh ib in the land of mnar and the nameless city of arabia deserta as we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associationseven weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the campthe planes fueltank in the interest of greater lightness had been only partly filled hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations even so however we covered an enormous extent of groundor rather airafter swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible there seemed to be no limit to the mountainrange or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills fifty miles of flight in each direction shewed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice there were though some highly absorbing diversifications such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinkingplace in the great range the headlands at the streams entrance had been boldly carved into cyclopean pylons and something about the ridgy barrelshaped designs stirred up oddly vague hateful and confusing semiremembrances in both danforth and mewe also came upon several starshaped open spaces evidently public squares and noted various undulations in the terrain where a sharp hill rose it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling stone edifice but there were at least two exceptions of these latter one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the wellknown snake tomb in the ancient valley of petraflying inland from the mountains we discovered that the city was not of infinite width even though its length along the foothills seemed endless after about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice the course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad depressed line while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the misthazed westso far we had made no landing yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable accordingly we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our navigable pass there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on foot though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landingplaces selecting that nearest to the pass since our next flight would be across the great range and back to camp we succeeded about 1230 pm in coming down on a smooth hard snowfield wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favourable takeoff later onit did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold for our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass hand camera light provisions voluminous notebooks and paper geologists hammer and chisel specimenbags coil of climbing rope and powerful electric torches with extra batteries this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing take ground pictures make drawings and topographical sketches and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope outcropping or mountain cave fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up place in a spare specimenbag and use on the ancient principle of hareandhounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate this had been brought in case we found some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual rockchipping method of trailblazingwalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously true we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years agobefore any known race of men could have existedwas none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual both danforth and i found ourselves bearing up very well and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot it took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic fivepointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet for this latter we headed and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered cyclopean blocks we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our speciesthis rampart shaped like a star and perhaps 300 feet from point to point was built of jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size averaging 6 8 feet in surface there was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface looking through these we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick that there were no partitions remaining within and that there were traces of banded carvings or basreliefs on the interior walls facts we had indeed guessed before when flying low over this rampart and others like it though lower parts must have originally existed all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this pointwe crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less icechoked and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully and studied its mortarless cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment we wished that pabodie were present for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built upthe halfmile walk downhill to the actual city with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background was something whose smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but danforth and me conceive such optical effects between us and the churning vapours of the west lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers its outr and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision it was a mirage in solid stone and were it not for the photographs i would still doubt that such a thing could be the general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all descriptioneven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its infinite bizarrerie endless variety preternatural massiveness and utterly alien exoticism there were geometrical forms for which an euclid could scarcely find a namecones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion shafts with odd bulbous enlargements broken columns in curious groups and fivepointed or fiveridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness as we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the icesheet and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures at various heights of orderly streets there seemed to be none the only broad open swath being a mile to the left where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town into the mountainsour fieldglasses shewed the external horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures and dotgroups to be very prevalent and we could half imagine what the city must once have looked likeeven though most of the roofs and towertops had necessarily perished as a whole it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys all of them deep canyons and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges now outspread below us it loomed like a dreamphantasy against a westward mist through whose northern end the low reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was struggling to shine and when for a moment that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow the effect was subtly menacing in a way i can never hope to depict even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful malignity the last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there under the glaciation we believed there must be a flight of steps or its equivalentwhen at last we plunged into the labyrinthine town itself clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls our sensations again became such that i marvel at the amount of selfcontrol we retained danforth was frankly jumpy and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the campwhich i resented all the more because i could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare antiquity the speculations worked on his imagination too for in one placewhere a debrislittered alley turned a sharp cornerhe insisted that he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle imaginary sound from some undefined pointa muffled musical piping he said not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves yet somehow disturbingly different the ceaselessfivepointednessof the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed placenevertheless our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead and we mechanically carried out our programme of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented in the masonry we wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place nothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the jurassic and comanchian periods nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than the pliocene age in stark certainty we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least 500000 years and in all probability even longeras we proceeded through this maze of stoneshadowed twilight we stopped at all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities some were above our reach whilst others led only into icechoked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill one though spacious and inviting opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of descent now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a surviving shutter and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain these things had come from mesozoic gymnosperms and conifersespecially cretaceous cycadsand from fanpalms and early angiosperms of plainly tertiary date nothing definitely later than the pliocene could be discovered in the placing of these shutterswhose edges shewed the former presence of queer and longvanished hingesusage seemed to be varied some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures they seemed to have become wedged in place thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and fasteningsafter a time we came across a row of windowsin the bulges of a colossal fiveridged cone of undamaged apexwhich led into a vast wellpreserved room with stone flooring but these were too high in the room to permit of descent without a rope we had a rope with us but did not wish to bother with this twentyfoot drop unless obliged toespecially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action this enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort and our electric torches shewed bold distinct and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques we took careful note of this spot planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encounteredfinally though we did encounter exactly the opening we wished an archway about six feet wide and ten feet high marking the former end of an arial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation these archways of course were flush with upperstory floors and in this case one of the floors still existed the building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left facing westward that across the alley where the other archway yawned was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture it was totally dark inside and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptinessheaped debris made the entrance to the vast lefthand building doubly easy yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the longwished chance for though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us in the end however we made the plunge and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure the floor beyond was of great slate slabs and seemed to form the outlet of a long high corridor with sculptured wallsobserving the many inner archways which led off from it and realising the probable complexity of the nest of apartments within we decided that we must begin our system of hareandhound trailblazing hitherto our compasses together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountainrange between the towers in our rear had been enough to prevent our losing our way but from now on the artificial substitute would be necessary accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size placed these in a bag to be carried by danforth and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow this method would probably gain us immunity from straying since there did not appear to be any strong aircurrents inside the primordial masonry if such should develop or if our paper supply should give out we could of course fall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method of rockchippingjust how extensive a territory we had opened up it was impossible to guess without a trial the close and frequent connexion of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallise the lower part for all succeeding time indeed one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim bygone aeon rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay had the coming of the ice been foreseen and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode the precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the icesheet at this point would have to wait for later solution it had not very plainly been a grinding drive perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible and perhaps some flood from the river or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range had helped to create the special state now observable imagination could conceive almost anything in connexion with this placeviit would be cumbrous to give a detailed consecutive account of our wanderings inside that cavernous aeondead honeycomb of primal masonry that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time after uncounted epochs to the tread of human feet this is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings our flashlight photographs of those carvings will do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing and it is lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us as it was we made crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used upthe building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past the inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls but on the lower levels were excellently preserved labyrinthine complexity involving curiously irregular differences in floor levels characterised the entire arrangement and we should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us we decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some 100 feet to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky ascent was effected over the steep transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs the rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions ranging from fivepointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes it might be safe to say that their general average was about 30 30 feet in floor area and 20 feet in height though many larger apartments existed after thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level we descended story by story into the submerged part where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building the cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became curiously oppressive and there was something vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours dimensions proportions decorations and constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework we soon realised from what the carvings revealed that this monstrous city was many million years oldwe cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses though the function of the arch was clearly much relied on the rooms we visited were wholly bare of all portable contents a circumstance which sustained our belief in the citys deliberate desertion the prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques there were exceptions to this rule of arrangement but its preponderance was overwhelming often however a series of smooth cartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bandsthe technique we soon saw was mature accomplished and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilised mastery though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race in delicacy of execution no sculpture i have ever seen could approach it the minutest details of elaborate vegetation or of animal life were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skilful intricacy the arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five the pictorial bands followed a highly formalised tradition and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the crosssection with the twodimensional silhouette and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity it is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futuriststhe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines whose depth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches when cartouches with dotgroups appearedevidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial language and alphabetthe depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half and of the dots perhaps a halfinch more the pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface in some specimens marks of a former colouration could be detected though for the most part the untold aeons had disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied the more one studied the marvellous technique the more one admired the things beneath their strict conventionalisation one could grasp the minute and accurate observation and graphic skill of the artists and indeed the very conventions themselves served to symbolise and accentuate the real essence or vital differentiation of every object delineated we felt too that besides these recognisable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli which another mental and emotional background and a fuller or different sensory equipment might have made of profound and poignant significance to usthe subjectmatter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished epoch of their creation and contained a large proportion of evident history it is this abnormal historicmindedness of the primal racea chance circumstance operating through coincidence miraculously in our favourwhich made the carvings so awesomely informative to us and which caused us to place their photography and transcription above all other considerations in certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps astronomical charts and other scientific designs on an enlarged scalethese things giving a naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes and dadoes in hinting at what the whole revealed i can only hope that my account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those who believe me at all it would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage theminterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelvefoot doorways both now and then retaining the petrified wooden plankselaborately carved and polishedof the actual shutters and doors all metal fixtures had long ago vanished but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room windowframes with odd transparent panesmostly ellipticalsurvived here and there though in no considerable quantity there were also frequent niches of great magnitude generally empty but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilitiesheating lighting and the likeof a sort suggested in many of the carvings ceilings tended to be plain but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles mostly fallen now floors were also paved with such tiles though plain stonework predominatedas i have said all furniture and other moveables were absent but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomblike echoing rooms above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus litter and debris but farther down this condition decreased in some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness of course where rifts or collapses had occurred the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones a central courtas in other structures we had seen from the airsaved the inner regions from total darkness so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details below the icecap however the twilight deepened and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blacknessto form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeonsilent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods memories and impressions the sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us the moment we came upon a perfect section of carving where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist it took only a brief study to give us the hideous trutha truth which it would be naive to claim danforth and i had not independently suspected before though we had carefully refrained from even hinting it to each other there could now be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years ago when mans ancestors were primitive archaic mammals and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of europe and asiawe had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insistedeach to himselfthat the omnipresence of the fivepointed motif meant only some cultural or religious exaltation of the archaean natural object which had so patently embodied the quality of fivepointedness as the decorative motifs of minoan crete exalted the sacred bull those of egypt the scarabaeus those of rome the wolf and the eagle and those of various savage tribes some chosen totemanimal but this lone refuge was now stripped from us and we were forced to face definitely the reasonshaking realisation which the reader of these pages has doubtless long ago anticipated i can scarcely bear to write it down in black and white even now but perhaps that will not be necessarythe things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs but far worse mere dinosaurs were new and almost brainless objectsbut the builders of the city were wise and old and had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down wellnigh a thousand million years rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of cells rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all they were the makers and enslavers of that life and above all doubt the originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the pnakotic manuscripts and thenecronomiconaffrightedly hint about they were the great old ones that had filtered down from the stars when earth was youngthe beings whose substance an alien evolution had shaped and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred and to think that only the day before danforth and i had actually looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilised substance and that poor lake and his party had seen their complete outlines it is of course impossible for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of prehuman life after the first shock of the certain revelation we had to pause a while to recuperate and it was fully three oclock before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research the sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late dateperhaps two million years agoas checked up by geological biological and astronomical features and embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet one edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly even fifty million yearsto the lower eocene or upper cretaceousand contained basreliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else with one tremendous exception that we encountered that was we have since agreed the oldest domestic structure we traversedwere it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public i would refrain from telling what i found and inferred lest i be confined as a madman of course the infinitely early parts of the patchwork talerepresenting the preterrestrial life of the starheaded beings on other planets and in other galaxies and in other universescan readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings themselves yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics that i scarcely know what to think let others judge when they see the photographs i shall publishnaturally no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction of any connected story nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages of that story in their proper order some of the vast rooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned whilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors the best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the ancient ground levela cavern perhaps 200 feet square and sixty feet high which had almost undoubtedly been an educational centre of some sort there were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms and buildings since certain chapters of experience and certain summaries or phases of racial history had evidently been favourites with different decorators or dwellers sometimes though variant versions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points and filling in gapsi still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal of course we even now have only the barest outline and much of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made it may be the effect of this later studythe revived memories and vague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed horrorglimpse whose essence he will not reveal even to mewhich has been the immediate source of danforths present breakdown but it had to be for we could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible information and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity certain lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouragedviithe full story so far as deciphered will shortly appear in an official bulletin of miskatonic university here i shall sketch only the salient high lights in a formless rambling way myth or otherwise the sculptures told of the coming of those starheaded things to the nascent lifeless earth out of cosmic spacetheir coming and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark upon spatial pioneering they seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast membraneous wingsthus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague they had lived under the sea a good deal building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown principles of energy evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed mans today though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate forms only when obliged to some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage of mechanised life on other planets but had receded upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying their preternatural toughness of organisation and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live on a high plane without the more specialised fruits of artificial manufacture and even without garments except for occasional protection against the elementsit was under the sea at first for food and later for other purposes that they first created earthlifeusing available substances according to longknown methods the more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies they had done the same thing on other planets having manufactured not only necessary foods but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of moulding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the community these viscous masses were without doubt what abdul alhazred whispered about as the shoggoths in his frightfulnecronomiconthough even that mad arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb when the starheaded old ones on this planet had synthesised their simple food forms and bred a good supply of shoggoths they allowed other cellgroups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes extirpating any whose presence became troublesomewith the aid of the shoggoths whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights the small low cities under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land indeed the highly adaptable old ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe and probably retained many traditions of land construction as we studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities including that whose aeondead corridors we were even then traversing we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain even to ourselves the tops of the buildings which in the actual city around us had of course been weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago were clearly displayed in the basreliefs and shewed vast clusters of needlelike spires delicate finials on certain cone and pyramid apexes and tiers of thin horizontal scalloped discs capping cylindrical shafts this was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous mirage cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years which loomed on our ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first approached poor lakes illfated campof the life of the old ones both under the sea and after part of them migrated to land volumes could be written those in shallow water had continued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual waythe writing accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces those lower down in the ocean depths though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to furnish light pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their headssenses which rendered all the old ones partly independent of light in emergencies their forms of sculpture and writing had changed curiously during the descent embodying certain apparently chemical coating processesprobably to secure phosphorescencewhich the basreliefs could not make clear to us the beings moved in the sea partly by swimmingusing the lateral crinoid armsand partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudofeet occasionally they accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fanlike folding wings on land they locally used the pseudofeet but now and then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings the many slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate flexible strong and accurate in muscularnervous cordination ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operationsthe toughness of the things was almost incredible even the terrific pressures of the deepest seabottoms appeared powerless to harm them very few seemed to die at all except by violence and their burialplaces were very limited the fact that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with fivepointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it the beings multiplied by means of sporeslike vegetable pteridophytes as lake had suspectedbut owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity and consequent lack of replacement needs they did not encourage the largescale development of new prothalli except when they had new regions to colonise the young matured swiftly and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine the prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved and produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which i shall describe more fully in my coming monograph these varied slightly according to sea or land residence but had the same foundations and essentialsthough able like vegetables to derive nourishment from inorganic substances they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food they ate uncooked marine life under the sea but cooked their viands on land they hunted game and raised meat herdsslaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted they resisted all ordinary temperatures marvellously and in their natural state could live in water down to freezing when the great chill of the pleistocene drew on howevernearly a million years agothe land dwellers had to resort to special measures including artificial heating until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back into the sea for their prehistoric flights through cosmic space legend said they had absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating breathing or heat conditions but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method in any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harmbeing nonpairing and semivegetable in structure the old ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life but seemed to organise large households on the principles of comfortable spaceutility andas we deduced from the pictured occupations and diversions of codwellerscongenial mental association in furnishing their homes they kept everything in the centre of the huge rooms leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment lighting in the case of the land inhabitants was accomplished by a device probably electrochemical in nature both on land and under water they used curious tables chairs and couches like cylindrical framesfor they rested and slept upright with foldeddown tentaclesand racks for the hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their booksgovernment was evidently complex and probably socialistic though no certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw there was extensive commerce both local and between different cities certain small flat counters fivepointed and inscribed serving as money probably the smaller of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency though the culture was mainly urban some agriculture and much stockraising existed mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced travel was very frequent but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonising movements by which the race expanded for personal locomotion no external aid was used since in land air and water movement alike the old ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for speed loads however were drawn by beasts of burdenshoggoths under the sea and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existencethese vertebrates as well as an infinity of other lifeformsanimal and vegetable marine terrestrial and arialwere the products of unguided evolution acting on lifecells made by the old ones but escaping beyond their radius of attention they had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings bothersome forms of course were mechanically exterminated it interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling primitive mammal used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable in the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vastwinged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to palaeontologythe persistence with which the old ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the earths crust was little short of miraculous though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the archaean age there was no interruption in their civilisation or in the transmission of their records their original place of advent to the planet was the antarctic ocean and it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighbouring south pacific according to one of the sculptured maps the whole globe was then under water with stone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed another map shews a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements though their main centres were transferred to the nearest seabottom later maps which display this land mass as cracking and drifting and sending certain detached parts northward uphold in a striking way the theories of continental drift lately advanced by taylor wegener and jolywith the upheaval of new land in the south pacific tremendous events began some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered yet that was not the worst misfortune another racea land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman spawn of cthulhusoon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the old ones wholly back to the seaa colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements later peace was made and the new lands were given to the cthulhu spawn whilst the old ones held the sea and the older lands new land cities were foundedthe greatest of them in the antarctic for this region of first arrival was sacred from then on as before the antarctic remained the centre of the old ones civilisation and all the discoverable cities built there by the cthulhu spawn were blotted out then suddenly the lands of the pacific sank again taking with them the frightful stone city of rlyeh and all the cosmic octopi so that the old ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak at a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globehence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make systematic borings with pabodies type of apparatus in certain widely separated regionsthe steady trend down the ages was from water to land a movement encouraged by the rise of new land masses though the ocean was never wholly deserted another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the shoggoths upon which successful sealife depended with the march of time as the sculptures sadly confessed the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost so that the old ones had to depend on the moulding of forms already in existence on land the great reptiles proved highly tractable but the shoggoths of the sea reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence presented for a time a formidable problemthey had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of the old ones and had modelled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary limbs and organs but now their selfmodelling powers were sometimes exercised independently and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion they had it seems developed a semistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the old ones without always obeying it sculptured images of these shoggoths filled danforth and me with horror and loathing they were normally shapeless entities composed of a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles and each averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere they had however a constantly shifting shape and volume throwing out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight hearing and speech in imitation of their masters either spontaneously or according to suggestionthey seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the permian age perhaps 150 million years ago when a veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine old ones pictures of this war and of the headless slimecoated fashion in which the shoggoths typically left their slain victims held a marvellously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold ages the old ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against the rebel entities and in the end had achieved a complete victory thereafter the sculptures shewed a period in which shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed old ones as the wild horses of the american west were tamed by cowboys though during the rebellion the shoggoths had shewn an ability to live out of water this transition was not encouraged since their usefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble of their managementduring the jurassic age the old ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer spacethis time by halffungous halfcrustacean creatures from a planet identifiable as the remote and recently discovered pluto creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill legends of the north and remembered in the himalayas as the migo or abominable snowmen to fight these beings the old ones attempted for the first time since their terrene advent to sally forth again into the planetary ether but despite all traditional preparations found it no longer possible to leave the earths atmosphere whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been it was now definitely lost to the race in the end the migo drove the old ones out of all the northern lands though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea little by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginningit was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the cthulhu spawn and the migo seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the old ones they were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space the old ones but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties were strictly material and must have had their absolute origin within the known spacetime continuum whereas the first sources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath all this of course assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology conceivably the old ones might have invented a cosmic framework to account for their occasional defeats since historical interest and pride obviously formed their chief psychological element it is significant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure legendsthe changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes in certain cases existing science will require revision while in other cases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed as i have said the hypothesis of taylor wegener and joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower surfacean hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines of africa and south america and the way the great mountain chains are rolled and shoved upreceives striking support from this uncanny sourcemaps evidently shewing the carboniferous world of an hundred million or more years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate africa from the once continuous realms of europe then the valusia of hellish primal legend asia the americas and the antarctic continent other chartsand most significantly one in connexion with the founding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around usshewed all the present continents well differentiated and in the latest discoverable specimendating perhaps from the pliocene agethe approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of alaska with siberia of north america with europe through greenland and of south america with the antarctic continent through graham land in the carboniferous map the whole globeocean floor and rifted land mass alikebore symbols of the old ones vast stone cities but in the later charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very plain the final pliocene specimen shewed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of south america nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of south latitude knowledge and interest in the northern world save for a study of coastlines probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membraneous wings had evidently declined to zero among the old onesdestruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains the centrifugal rending of continents the seismic convulsions of land or seabottom and other natural causes was a matter of common record and it was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on the vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general centre of the race built early in the cretaceous age after a titanic earthbuckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant it appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all where reputedly the first old ones had settled on a primal seabottom in the new citymany of whose features we could recognise in the sculptures but which stretched fully an hundred miles along the mountainrange in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our arial surveythere were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming part of the first seabottom city which were thrust up to light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of strataviiinaturally danforth and i studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which we were of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance and on the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very late date whose walls though somewhat damaged by a neighbouring rift contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region much beyond the period of the pliocene map whence we derived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world this was the last place we examined in detail since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objectivecertainly we were in one of the strangest weirdest and most terrible of all the corners of earths globe of all existing lands it was infinitely the most ancient and the conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of leng which even the mad author of thenecronomiconwas reluctant to discuss the great mountain chain was tremendously longstarting as a low range at luitpold land on the coast of weddell sea and virtually crossing the entire continent the really high part stretched in a mighty arc from about latitude 82 e longitude 60 to latitude 70 e longitude 115 with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long icelocked coast whose hills were glimpsed by wilkes and mawson at the antarctic circleyet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at hand i have said that these peaks are higher than the himalayas but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earths highest that grim honour is beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to record at all whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation it seems that there was one part of the ancient landthe first part that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the old ones had seeped down from the starswhich had come to be shunned as vaguely and namelessly evil cities built there had crumbled before their time and had been found suddenly deserted then when the first great earthbuckling had convulsed the region in the comanchian age a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaosand earth had received her loftiest and most terrible mountainsif the scale of the carvings was correct these abhorred things must have been much over 40000 feet highradically vaster than even the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed they extended it appeared from about latitude 77 e longitude 70 to latitude 70 e longitude 100less than 300 miles away from the dead city so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague opalescent haze their northern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle coastline at queen mary landsome of the old ones in the decadent days had made strange prayers to those mountains but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond no human eye had ever seen them and as i studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings i prayed that none ever might there are protecting hills along the coast beyond themqueen mary and kaiser wilhelm landsand i thank heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills i am not as sceptical about old tales and fears as i used to be and i do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptors notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the brooding crests and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible pinnacles all through the long polar night there may be a very real and very monstrous meaning in the old pnakotic whispers about kadath in the cold wastebut the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange even if less namelessly accursed soon after the founding of the city the great mountainrange became the seat of the principal temples and many carvings shewed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts in the course of ages the caves had appeared and had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples with the advance of still later epochs all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters so that the mountains the foothills and the plains below them were a veritable network of connected caverns and galleries many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep underground and of the final discovery of the stygian sunless sea that lurked at earths bowelsthis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains and which had formerly turned at the base of the old ones range and flowed beside that chain into the indian ocean between budd and totten lands on wilkess coastline little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed the old ones understanding what had happened and exercising their always keen artistic sense had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darknessthis river once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges was plainly the one whose extinct course we had seen in our aroplane survey its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the regions agelong aeondead history so that we were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient featuressquares important buildings and the likefor guidance in further explorations we could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant tertiary vegetation had looked like it must have had a marvellous and mystic beauty and as i thought of it i almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the citys inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit yet according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror for there was a sombre and recurrent type of scene in which the old ones were shewn in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some objectnever allowed to appear in the designfound in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving vinedraped cycadforests from those horrible westward mountainsit was only in the one latebuilt house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the citys desertion undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period indeed very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward but this was the first and only set we directly encountered we meant to look farther later on but as i have said immediate conditions dictated another present objective there would though have been a limitfor after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the old ones there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration the ultimate blow of course was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall and which has never departed from the illfated polesthe great cold that at the worlds other extremity put an end to the fabled lands of lomar and hyperboreajust when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say in terms of exact years nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a distance of about 500000 years from the present but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier all quantitative estimates are partly guesswork but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably less than a million years ago and that the actual desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the pleistocene500000 years agoas reckoned in terms of the earths whole surfacein the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere and of a decreased country life on the part of the old ones heating devices were shewn in the houses and winter travellers were represented as muffled in protective fabrics then we saw a series of cartouches the continuous band arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings depicting a constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmthsome fleeing to cities under the sea off the faraway coast and some clambering down through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighbouring black abyss of subterrene watersin the end it seems to have been the neighbouring abyss which received the greatest colonisation this was partly due no doubt to the traditional sacredness of this especial region but may have been more conclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains and for retaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of communication with various mines the linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes including the chiselling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abysssharply downpointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew according to our most thoughtful estimates on the guide map we were compiling it was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where we were both being on the mountainward edge of the city one less than a quartermile toward the ancient rivercourse and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite directionthe abyss it seems had shelving shores of dry land at certain places but the old ones built their new city under waterno doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth the depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great so that the earths internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite period the beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to parttimeand eventually of course wholetimeresidence under water since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy there were many sculptures which shewed how they had always frequently visited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great river the darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nightsdecadent though their style undoubtedly was these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea the old ones had gone about it scientifically quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains and employing expert workers from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods these workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new ventureshoggothtissue from which to breed stonelifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city and other protoplasmic matter to mould into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposesat last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that stygian sea its architecture much like that of the city above and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent in building operations the newly bred shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular intelligence and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvellous quickness they seemed to converse with the old ones by mimicking their voicesa sort of musical piping over a wide range if poor lakes dissection had indicated arightand to work more from spoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times they were however kept in admirable control the phosphorescent organisms supplied light with vast effectiveness and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outerworld nightart and decoration were pursued though of course with a certain decadence the old ones seemed to realise this falling off themselves and in many cases anticipated the policy of constantine the great by transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city just as the emperor in a similar age of decline stripped greece and asia of their finest art to give his new byzantine capital greater splendours than its own people could create that the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned by the time total abandonment did occurand it surely must have occurred before the polar pleistocene was far advancedthe old ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent artor had ceased to recognise the superior merit of the older carvings at any rate the aeonsilent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation though all the best separate statues like other moveables had been taken awaythe decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were as i have said the latest we could find in our limited search they left us with a picture of the old ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the seacavern city in winter and sometimes trading with the seabottom cities off the antarctic coast by this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised for the sculptures shewed many signs of the colds malign encroachments vegetation was declining and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer the saurian livestock were nearly all dead and the mammals were standing it none too well to keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously coldresistant shoggoths to land life a thing the old ones had formerly been reluctant to do the great river was now lifeless and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales all the birds had flown away save only the great grotesque penguinswhat had happened afterward we could only guess how long had the new seacavern city survived was it still down there a stony corpse in eternal blackness had the subterranean waters frozen at last to what fate had the oceanbottom cities of the outer world been delivered had any of the old ones shifted north ahead of the creeping icecap existing geology shews no trace of their presence had the frightful migo been still a menace in the outer land world of the north could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earths deepest waters those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressureand men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times and has the killerwhale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by borchgrevingkthe specimens found by poor lake did not enter into these guesses for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land citys history they were according to their location certainly not less than thirty million years old and we reflected that in their day the seacavern city and indeed the cavern itself had no existence they would have remembered an older scene with lush tertiary vegetation everywhere a younger land city of flourishing arts around them and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a faraway tropic oceanand yet we could not help thinking about these specimensespecially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from lakes hideously ravaged camp there was something abnormal about that whole businessthe strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebodys madnessthose frightful gravesthe amountand natureof the missing materialgedneythe unearthly toughness of those archaic monstrosities and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now shewed the race to have danforth and i had seen a good deal in the last few hours and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible secrets of primal natureixi have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our immediate objective this of course had to do with the chiselled avenues to the black inner world of whose existence we had not known before but which we were now eager to find and traverse from the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighbouring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy sunless cliffs above the great abyss down whose side adequate paths improved by the old ones led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean to behold this fabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of the thingyet we realised we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include it on our present flightit was now 8 pm and we had not enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever we had done so much of our studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use and despite the special dry cell formula would obviously be good for only about four morethough by keeping one torch unused except for especially interesting or difficult places we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that it would not do to be without a light in these cyclopean catacombs hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photographycuriosity having long ago got the better of horrorbut just now we must hasten our supply of trailblazing paper was far from unlimited and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it but we did let one large notebook go if worst came to worst we could resort to rockchippingand of course it would be possible even in case of really lost direction to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error so at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnelaccording to the carvings from which we had made our map the desired tunnelmouth could not be much more than a quartermile from where we stood the intervening space shewing solidlooking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a subglacial level the opening itself would be in the basementon the angle nearest the foothillsof a vast fivepointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature which we tried to identify from our arial survey of the ruins no such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged or that it had been totally shattered in an icerift we had noticed in the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked so that we would have to try the next nearest onethe one less than a mile to the north the intervening rivercourse prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip and indeed if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly oneabout a mile beyond our second choiceas we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compasstraversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation clambering up ramps crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again encountering choked doorways and piles of debris hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches taking false leads and retracing our way in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled downwe were repeatedly tantalised by the sculptured walls along our route many must have told tales of immense historical importance and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by as it was we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch if we had had more films we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain basreliefs but timeconsuming hand copying was clearly out of the questioni come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate or to hint rather than state is very strong it is necessary however to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration we had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnels mouthhaving crossed a secondstory bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanshipwhen about 830 pm danforths keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual if we had had a dog with us i suppose we would have been warned before at first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystalpure air but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely let me try to state the thing without flinching there was an odourand that odour was vaguely subtly and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the horror poor lake had dissectedof course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now there were several conceivable explanations and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering most important of all we did not retreat without further investigation for having come this far we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster anyway what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe such things did not happen in any normal world it was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torchtempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from the oppressive wallsand which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debrisdanforths eyes as well as nose proved better than mine for it was likewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many halfchoked arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level it did not look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it the irregular nature of the litter precluded any definite marks but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as if of runners this was what made us pause againit was during that pause that we caughtsimultaneously this timethe other odour ahead paradoxically it was both a less frightful and a more frightful odourless frightful intrinsically but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances unless of course gedney for the odour was the plain and familiar one of common petroleveryday gasolineour motivation after that is something i will leave to psychologists we knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this nighted burialplace of the aeons hence could not doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditionspresent or at least recentjust ahead yet in the end we did let sheer burning curiosityor anxietyor autohypnotismor vague thoughts of responsibility toward gedneyor what notdrive us on danforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at the alleyturning in the ruins above and of the faint musical pipingpotentially of tremendous significance in the light of lakes dissection report despite its close resemblance to the cavemouth echoes of the windy peakswhich he thought he had shortly afterward half heard from unknown depths below i in my turn whispered of how the camp was leftof what had disappeared and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have conceived the inconceivablea wild trip across the monstrous mountains and a descent into the unknown primal masonrybut we could not convince each other or even ourselves of anything definite we had turned off all light as we stood still and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute having automatically begun to move ahead we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch the disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off and the smell of gasoline grew stronger more and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease we had been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air our tunnel quest was a blind one and we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture openedthe torch flashing over the grotesquely carven walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood shewed several doorways in various states of obstruction and from one of them the gasoline odourquite submerging that other hint of odourcame with especial distinctness as we looked more steadily we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from that particular opening whatever the lurking horror might be we believed the direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest i do not think anyone will wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motionand yet when we did venture inside that black arch our first impression was one of anticlimax for amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypta perfect cube with sides of about twenty feetthere remained no recent object of instantly discernible size so that we looked instinctively though in vain for a farther doorway in another moment however danforths sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed and we turned on both torches full strength though what we saw in that light was actually simple and trifling i am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied it was a rough levelling of the debris upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odour even at this extreme superplateau altitude in other words it could not be other than a sort of campa camp made by questing beings who like us had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way to the abysslet me be plain the scattered objects were so far as substance was concerned all from lakes camp and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place many spent matches three illustrated books more or less curiously smudged an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional carton a broken fountain pen some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tentcloth a used electric battery with circular of directions a folder that came with our type of tent heater and a sprinkling of crumpled papers it was all bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them we felt we had come to the worst we had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us yet the effect of the sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to beara mad gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones just as the dots on those insane fivepointed gravemounds might have been made and he might conceivably have prepared rough hasty sketchesvarying in their accuracy or lack of itwhich outlined the neighbouring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside our previous routea place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our arial surveyto the present fivepointed structure and the tunnelmouth therein he might i repeat have prepared such sketches for those before us were quite obviously compiled as our own had been from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth though not from the ones which we had seen and used but what this artblind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior despite haste and carelessness to any of the decadent carvings from which they were takenthe characteristic and unmistakable technique of the old ones themselves in the dead citys heydaythere are those who will say danforth and i were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that since our conclusions were nownotwithstanding their wildnesscompletely fixed and of a nature i need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this perhaps we were madfor have i not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness but i think i can detect something of the same spiritalbeit in a less extreme formin the men who stalk deadly beasts through african jungles to photograph them or study their habits halfparalysed with terror though we were there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the endof course we did not mean to face thator thosewhich we knew had been there but we felt that they must be gone by now they would by this time have found the other neighbouring entrance to the abyss and have passed within to whatever nightblack fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulfthe ultimate gulf they had never seen or if that entrance too was blocked they would have gone on to the north seeking another they were we remembered partly independent of lightlooking back to that moment i can scarcely recall just what precise form our new emotions tookjust what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our sense of expectancy we certainly did not mean to face what we fearedyet i will not deny that we may have had a lurking unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantagepoint probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shewn on the crumpled sketches we had found we had at once recognised it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above something about the impressiveness of its rendering even in these hasty diagrams made us think that its subglacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us it was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figuredbeing indeed among the first things built in the city its carvings if preserved could not but be highly significant moreover it might form a good present link with the upper worlda shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing and probably that by which those others had descendedat any rate the thing we did was to study the terrible sketcheswhich quite perfectly confirmed our ownand start back over the indicated course to the circular place the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us the other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that i need not speak of our journeyduring which we continued to leave an economical trail of paperfor it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul de sac except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter under foot and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent we were again faintly consciousspasmodicallyof that more hideous and more persistent scent after the way had branched from our former course we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls noting in almost every case the wellnigh omnipresent sculptures which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the old onesabout 930 pm while traversing a vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch it appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great the corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins but we could see much through it even before we emerged beyond there stretched a prodigious round spacefully 200 feet in diameterstrown with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross the walls werein available spacesboldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions and displayed despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot an artistic splendour far beyond anything we had encountered before the littered floor was quite heavily glaciated and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depthbut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique babylon only the rapidity of our flight and the perspective which confounded the descent with the towers inner wall had prevented our noticing this feature from the air and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place but danforth and i could merely admire and marvel we could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed the thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the towera highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposureand its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the wallsas we stepped out into the awesome halfdaylight of this monstrous cylinderbottomfifty million years old and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyeswe saw that the ramptraversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet this we recalled from our arial survey meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twentyfoot mound of crumbled masonry somewhat sheltered for threefourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins according to the sculptures the original tower had stood in the centre of an immense circular plaza and had been perhaps 500 or 600 feet high with tiers of horizontal discs near the top and a row of needlelike spires along the upper rim most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inwarda fortunate happening since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole interior choked as it was the ramp shewed sad battering whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently halfclearedit took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere the towers mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region oddly we were still thinking about possible later tripseven after all we had seen and guessed then as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor there came a sight which for the time excluded all other mattersit was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramps lower and outwardprojecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view there they werethe three sledges missing from lakes campshaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places they were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped and contained things memorably familiar enoughthe gasoline stove fuel cans instrument cases provision tins tarpaulins obviously bulging with books and some bulging with less obvious contentseverything derived from lakes equipment after what we had found in that other room we were in a measure prepared for this encounter the really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us it seems that others as well as lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens for there were two here both stiffly frozen perfectly preserved patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred and wrapped with patent care to prevent further damage they were the bodies of young gedney and the missing dogxmany people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery and i am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations we had replaced the tarpaulin over poor gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousnessthe first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights well known and mundane though they were their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have beensince they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmonyhad it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which lakes dissection report had led us to expect in those othersand which indeed our overwrought fancies had been reading into every windhowl we had heard since coming on the camp horrorit would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the aeondead region around us a voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs as it was however the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustmentsall our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste as utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life as the sterile disc of the moon what we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an agedenied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response instead it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarised by our sea days off victoria land and our camp days at mcmurdo sound that we shuddered to think of it here where such things ought not to be to be briefit was simply the raucous squawking of a penguinthe muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had comeregions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss the presence of a living waterbird in such a directionin a world whose surface was one of agelong and uniform lifelessnesscould lead to only one conclusion hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound it was indeed repeated and seemed at times to come from more than one throat seeking its source we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared resuming our trailblazingwith an added papersupply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the sledgeswhen we left daylight behindas the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus we plainly discerned some curious dragging tracks and once danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous the course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more northerly tunnelmouth and we were glad to find that a bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open the tunnel according to the chart ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our arial survey as remarkably well preserved along our path the single torch shewed a customary profusion of carvings but we did not pause to examine any of thesesuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us and we flashed on the second torch it is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near those other ones having left their supplies in the great circular place must have planned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as if they had never existed this white waddling thing was fully six feet high yet we seemed to realise at once that it was not one of those others they were larger and dark and according to the sculptures their motion over land surfaces was a swift assured matter despite the queerness of their seaborn tentacle equipment but to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain we were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones for it was only a penguinalbeit of a huge unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessnesswhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the old ones sculptures and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stockundoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits that their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought was not for a moment to be doubted and this evidence of the gulfs continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancieswe wondered too what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain the state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply we doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the old onesan amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the old ones remained regrettingin a flareup of the old spirit of pure sciencethat we could not photograph these anomalous creatures we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clearnot long afterward a steep descent in a long low doorless and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnelmouth at last we had passed two more penguins and heard others immediately ahead then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarilya perfect inverted hemisphere obviously deep underground fully an hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one and that one yawning cavernously with a black arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet it was the entrance to the great abyssin this vast hemisphere whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome a few albino penguins waddledaliens there but indifferent and unseeing the black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep descending grade its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiselled jambs and lintel from that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air and perhaps even a suspicion of vapour proceeded and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains might conceal we wondered too whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected by poor lake as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampartcrowned peak might not be caused by the tortuouschannelled rising of some such vapour from the unfathomed regions of earths coreentering the tunnel we saw that its outline wasat least at the startabout fifteen feet each way sides floor and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry the sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late decadent style and all the construction and carving were marvellously well preserved the floor was quite clear except for a slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others the farther one advanced the warmer it became so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments we wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below and whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot after a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved regularity occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut in the floor several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss the nameless scent of such things was very distinct doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspectindeed it was just such a lure which had brought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place we saw several penguins as we passed along and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse the carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss but our previous wanderings had shewn us that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended onafter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed there was no visible vapour as at the mouth but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air the temperature was rapidly ascending and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us it was composed of furs and tentcloth taken from lakes camp and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the sidegalleries and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached the nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odourof what nature we could not guess though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared usa broadening and rising into a lofty naturallooking elliptical cavern with a level floor some 75 feet long and 50 broad and with many immense sidepassages leading away into cryptical darknessthough this cavern was natural in appearance an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings the walls were rough and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off and was free from all debris detritus or even dust to a positively abnormal extent except for the avenue through which we had come this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling the curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other something about this whole place with its polished and almost glistening floor struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encounteredthe regularity of the passage immediately ahead as well as the larger proportion of penguindroppings there prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cavemouths nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop for dust tracks of course could no longer be expected upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel wallsand stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage we realised of course the great decadence of the old ones sculpture at the time of the tunnelling and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us but now in this deeper section beyond the cavern there was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanationa difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect itthis new and degenerate work was coarse bold and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail it was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier sections but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface danforth had the idea that it was a second carvinga sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design in nature it was wholly decorative and conventional and consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of the old ones yet seeming more like a parody than a perpetuation of that tradition we could not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling behind the techniquean alien element danforth guessed that was responsible for the manifestly laborious substitution it was like yet disturbingly unlike what we had come to recognise as the old ones art and i was persistently reminded of such hybrid things as the ungainly palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the roman manner that others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the presence of a used torch battery on the floor in front of one of the most characteristic designssince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study we resumed our advance after a cursory look though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes developed nothing of the sort was perceived though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smoothfloored lateral tunnels we saw and heard fewer penguins but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth the new and inexplicable odour was abominably strong and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent puffs of visible vapour ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature and the relative nearness of the sunless seacliffs of the great abyss then quite unexpectedly we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor aheadobstructions which were quite definitely not penguinsand turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationaryxistill another time have i come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed i ought to be hardened by this stage but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing and leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror we saw as i have said certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead and i may add that our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing foetor now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before us the light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were and we dared approach them only because we could see even from a distance that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous starmounded graves at poor lakes campthey were indeed as lacking in completeness as most of those we had unearthedthough it grew plain from the thick darkgreen pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency there seemed to be only four of them whereas lakes bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us to find them in this state was wholly unexpected and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the darkpenguins attacked in a body retaliate savagely with their beaks and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit the obstructions did not suggest it for penguin beaks against the tough tissues lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make out besides the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peacefulhad there then been a struggle among those others and were the absent four responsible if so where were they were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us we glanced anxiously at some of the smoothfloored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant approach whatever the conflict was it had clearly been that which had frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering it must then have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here perhaps we reflected there had been a hideous running fight with the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them one could picture the daemoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying aheadi say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly would to heaven we had never approached them at all but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had supersededrun back before we had seen what we did see and before our minds were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily againboth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects so that we soon realised the dominant factor in their incompleteness mauled compressed twisted and ruptured as they were their chief common injury was total decapitation from each one the tentacled starfishhead had been removed and as we drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage their noisome darkgreen ichor formed a large spreading pool but its stench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench here more pungent than at any other point along our route only when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that second unexplainable foetor to any immediate sourceand the instant we did so danforth remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the old ones history in the permian age 150 million years ago gave vent to a nervetortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil palimpsest carvingsi came only just short of echoing his cry myself for i had seen those primal sculptures too and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slimecoating found on certain incomplete and prostrate old onesthose whom the frightful shoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation they were infamous nightmare sculptures even when telling of ageold bygone things for shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any beings the mad author of thenecronomiconhad nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet and that only drugged dreamers had ever conceived them formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processesviscous agglutinations of bubbling cellsrubbery fifteenfoot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductileslaves of suggestion builders of citiesmore and more sullen more and more intelligent more and more amphibious more and more imitativegreat god what madness made even those blasphemous old ones willing to use and to carve such thingsand now when danforth and i saw the freshly glistening and reflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank obscenely with that new unknown odour whose cause only a diseased fancy could envisageclung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wallin a series of grouped dotswe understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths it was not fear of those four missing othersfor all too well did we suspect they would do no harm again poor devils after all they were not evil things of their kind they were the men of another age and another order of being nature had played a hellish jest on themas it will on any others that human madness callousness or cruelty may hereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar wasteand this was their tragic homecomingthey had not been even savagesfor what indeed had they done that awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epochperhaps an attack by the furry frantically barking quadrupeds and a dazed defence against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia poor lake poor gedney and poor old ones scientists to the lastwhat had they done that we would not have done in their place god what intelligence and persistence what a facing of the incredible just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less incredible radiates vegetables monstrosities starspawnwhatever they had been they were menthey had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once worshipped and roamed among the treeferns they had found their dead city brooding under its curse and had read its carven latter days as we had done they had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they had never seenand what had they found all this flashed in unison through the thoughts of danforth and me as we looked from those headless slimecoated shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dotgroups of fresh slime on the wall beside themlooked and understood what must have triumphed and survived down there in the cyclopean watercity of that nighted penguinfringed abyss whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to belch pallidly as if in answer to danforths hysterical screamthe shock of recognising that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us into mute motionless statues and it is only through later conversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment it seemed aeons that we stood there but actually it could not have been more than ten or fifteen seconds that hateful pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulkand then came a sound which upset much of what we had just decided and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking confused penguins over our former trail back to the city along icesunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle and up that archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied automatic plunge for the sane outer air and light of daythe new sound as i have intimated upset much that we had decided because it was what poor lakes dissection had led us to attribute to those we had just judged dead it was danforth later told me precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alleycorner above the glacial level and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the windpipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves at the risk of seeming puerile i will add another thing too if only because of the surprising way danforths impression chimed with mine of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the interpretation though danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden sources to which poe may have had access when writing hisarthur gordon pyma century ago it will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally snowy birds of that malign regions coretekelili tekelilithat i may admit is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mistthat insidious musical piping over a singularly wide rangewe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered though we knew that the swiftness of the old ones would enable any screamroused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished to do so we had a vague hope however that nonaggressive conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture if only from scientific curiosity after all if such an one had nothing to fear for itself it would have no motive in harming us concealment being futile at this juncture we used our torch for a running glance behind and perceived that the mist was thinning would we see at last a complete and living specimen of those others again came that insidious musical pipingtekelili tekelilithen noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer it occurred to us that the entity might be wounded we could take no chances however since it was very obviously approaching in answer to danforths scream rather than in flight from any other entity the timing was too close to admit of doubt of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmarethat foetid unglimpsed mountain of slimespewing protoplasm whose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of the hillswe could form no guess and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled old oneperhaps a lone survivorto the peril of recapture and a nameless fatethank heaven we did not slacken our run the curling mist had thickened again and was driving ahead with increased speed whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them once more came that sinister wideranged pipingtekelili tekeliliwe had been wrong the thing was not wounded but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above them we could never know what that daemon message wasbut those burials at lakes camp had shewn how much importance the beings attached to their dead our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculpturesalmost felt even when scarcely seenbehindanother thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries there were several of the blind albino penguins in the open space and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability if at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of travelling need keeping it strictly in front of us the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our footfalls screen our true course and somehow set up a false lead amidst the churning spiralling fog the littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point as differing from the other morbidly polished burrows could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature even so far as we could conjecture for those indicated special senses which made the old ones partly though imperfectly independent of light in emergencies in fact we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste for we had of course decided to keep straight on toward the dead city since the consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkablethe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one the penguins alone could not have saved us but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so only a benign fate kept the curling vapours thick enough at the right moment for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish indeed they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave so that we actually caught one first and only halfglimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit if the fate which screened us was benign that which gave us the halfglimpse was infinitely the opposite for to that flash of semivision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted usour exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses in the midst of our flight with all our faculties centred on the problem of escape we were in no condition to observe and analyse details yet even so our latent braincells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils afterward we realised what it wasthat our retreat from the foetid slimecoating on those headless obstructions and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for in the neighbourhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable foetor had been wholly dominant but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those others this it had not donefor instead the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted and growing more and more poisonously insistent each secondso we glanced backsimultaneously it would appear though no doubt the incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other as we did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinthcentre ahead unhappy act not orpheus himself or lots wife paid much more dearly for a backward glance and again came that shocking wideranged pipingtekelili tekelilii might as well be frankeven if i cannot bear to be quite directin stating what we saw though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other the words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself it crippled our consciousness so completely that i wonder we had the residual sense to dim our torches as planned and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city instinct alone must have carried us throughperhaps better than reason could have done though if that was what saved us we paid a high price of reason we certainly had little enough left danforth was totally unstrung and the first thing i remember of the rest of the journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which i alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance it reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins reverberated through the vaultings ahead andthank godthrough the now empty vaultings behind he could not have begun it at onceelse we would not have been alive and blindly racing i shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous reactions might have broughtsouth station underwashington underpark street underkendallcentralharvard the poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the bostoncambridge tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in new england yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor homefeeling it had only horror because i knew unerringly the monstrous nefandous analogy that had suggested it we had expected upon looking back to see a terrible and incredibly moving entity if the mists were thin enough but of that entity we had formed a clear idea what we did seefor the mists were indeed all too malignly thinnedwas something altogether different and immeasurably more hideous and detestable it was the utter objective embodiment of the fantastic novelists thing that should not be and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platformthe great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterraneous distance constellated with strangely coloured lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinderbut we were not on a station platform we were on the track ahead as the nightmare plastic column of foetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its fifteenfoot sinus gathering unholy speed and driving before it a spiral rethickening cloud of the pallid abyssvapour it was a terrible indescribable thing vaster than any subway traina shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles faintly selfluminous and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnelfilling front that bore down upon us crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter still came that eldritch mocking crytekelili tekeliliand at last we remembered that the daemoniac shoggothsgiven life thought and plastic organ patterns solely by the old ones and having no language save that which the dotgroups expressedhad likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone mastersxiidanforth and i have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city yet these are purely dreamfragments involving no memory of volition details or physical exertion it was as if we floated in a nebulous world or dimension without time causation or orientation the grey halfdaylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat but we did not go near those cached sledges or look again at poor gedney and the dog they have a strange and titanic mausoleum and i hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbedit was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced but not even the fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky there was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs for as we wound our panting way up the sixtyfoot cylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead races early and undecayed techniquea farewell from the old ones written fifty million years agofinally scrambling out at the top we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward and the brooding peaks of the great mountains shewing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east the low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins and the terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape the sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous icevapours and the cold clutched at our vitals wearily resting the outfitbags to which we had instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the aeonold stone maze to the foothills where our aroplane waited of what had set us fleeing from the darkness of earths secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at allin less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothillsthe probable ancient terraceby which we had descended and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead half way uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathingspell and turned to look again at the fantastic palaeogean tangle of incredible stone shapes below usonce more outlined mystically against an unknown west as we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness the restless icevapours having moved up to the zenith where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusivethere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needlepointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rosecolour of the western sky up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient tableland the depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow for a second we gasped in admiration of the scenes unearthly cosmic beauty and then vague horror began to creep into our souls for this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden landhighest of earths peaks and focus of earths evil harbourers of nameless horrors and archaean secrets shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning untrodden by any living thing of earth but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar nightbeyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded kadath in the cold waste beyond abhorrent leng whereof unholy primal legends hint evasively we were the first human beings ever to see themand i hope to god we may be the lastif the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than 300 miles away yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence jut above that remote and snowy rim like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens their height then must have been tremendous beyond all known comparisoncarrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls looking at them i thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopesand wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those old ones who carved them so reticently i recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at queen mary land where even at that moment sir douglas mawsons expedition was doubtless working less than a thousand miles away and hoped that no evil fate would give sir douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the timeand danforth seemed to be even worseyet long before we had passed the great starshaped ruin and reached our plane our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast enough range whose recrossing lay ahead of us from these foothills the black ruincrusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east again reminding us of those strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich and when we thought of the damnable honeycombs inside them and of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their foetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles we could not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cavemouths where the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range to make matters worse we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summitsas poor lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanismand thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped of that and of the blasphemous horrorfostering abyss whence all such vapours cameall was well with the plane and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs danforth got the engine started without trouble and we made a very smooth takeoff over the nightmare city below us the primal cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw itso short yet infinitely long a time agoand we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass at a very high level there must have been great disturbance since the icedust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things but at 24000 feet the height we needed for the pass we found navigation quite practicable as we drew close to the jutting peaks the winds strange piping again became manifest and i could see danforths hands trembling at the controls rank amateur though i was i thought at that moment that i might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles and when i made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest i tried to keep all my skill and selfpossession about me and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the passresolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountaintop vapour and wishing that i had waxstopped ears like ulysses men off the sirens coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousnessbut danforth released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch could not keep quiet i felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city ahead at the caveriddled cubebarnacled peaks sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy rampartstrown foothills and upward at the seething grotesquely clouded sky it was then just as i was trying to steer safely through the pass that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment a second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safelyyet i am afraid that danforth will never be the same againi have said that danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanelya horror which i feel sadly sure is mainly responsible for his present breakdown we had snatches of shouted conversation above the winds piping and the engines buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city certain things we had agreed were not for people to know and discuss lightlyand i would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that starkweathermoore expedition and others at any cost it is absolutely necessary for the peace and safety of mankind that some of earths dark dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquestsall that danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage it was not he declares anything connected with the cubes and caves of echoing vaporous wormily honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed but a single fantastic daemoniac glimpse among the churning zenithclouds of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the old ones had shunned and feared it is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed through and of the actual though unrecognised mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near lakes camp the day before but it was so real to danforth that he suffers from it stillhe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about the black pit the carven rim the protoshoggoths the windowless solids with five dimensions the nameless cylinder the elder pharos yogsothoth the primal white jelly the colour out of space the wings the eyes in darkness the moonladder the original the eternal the undying and other bizarre conceptions but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years danforth indeed is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that wormriddled copy of thenecronomiconkept under lock and key in the college librarythe higher sky as we crossed the range was surely vaporous and disturbed enough and although i did not see the zenith i can well imagine that its swirls of icedust may have taken strange forms imagination knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected refracted and magnified by such layers of restless cloud might easily have supplied the restand of course danforth did not hint any of those specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance to draw on his bygone reading he could never have seen so much in one instantaneous glanceat the time his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single mad word of all too obvious sourcetekelili tekelili,1
when age fell upon the world and wonder went out of the minds of men when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly in whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of springs flowering meads when learning stripped earth of her mantle of beauty and poets sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and inwardlooking eyes when these things had come to pass and childish hopes had gone away forever there was a man who travelled out of life on a quest into the spaces whither the worlds dreams had fledof the name and abode of this man but little is written for they were of the waking world only yet it is said that both were obscure it is enough to know that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned and that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not on the fields and groves but on a dim court where other windows stared in dull despair from that casement one might see only walls and windows except sometimes when one leaned far out and peered aloft at the small stars that passed and because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man who dreams and reads much the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the greyness of tall cities after years he began to call the slowsailing stars by name and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existence no common eye suspects and one night a mighty gulf was bridged and the dreamhaunted skies swelled down to the lonely watchers window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonderthere came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold vortices of dust and fire swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds opiate oceans poured there litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and seanymphs of unrememberable deeps noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window and for days not counted in mens calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed the dreams that men have lost and in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore a green shore fragrant with lotusblossoms and starred by red camalotes,1

the horrible conclusion which had been gradually obtruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty i was lost completely hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recesses of the mammoth cave turn as i might in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path that nevermore should i behold the blessed light of day or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world outside my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief hope had departed yet indoctrinated as i was by a life of philosophical study i derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour for although i had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations i experienced none of these but stood quiet as soon as i clearly realised the loss of my bearingsnor did the thought that i had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment if i must die i reflected then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford a conception which carried with it more of tranquility than of despairstarving would prove my ultimate fate of this i was certain some i knew had gone mad under circumstances such as these but i felt that this end would not be mine my disaster was the result of no fault save my own since unbeknown to the guide i had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers and wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which i had pursued since forsaking my companionsalready my torch had begun to expire soon i would be enveloped by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth as i stood in the waning unsteady light i idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my coming end i remembered the accounts which i had heard of the colony of consumptives who taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world with its steady uniform temperature pure air and peaceful quiet had found instead death in strange and ghastly form i had seen the sad remains of their illmade cottages as i passed them by with the party and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and as vigorous as i now i grimly told myself my opportunity for settling this point had arrived provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this lifeas the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity i resolved to leave no stone unturned no possible means of escape neglected so summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs i set up a series of loud shoutings in the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamour yet as i called i believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose and that my voice magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me fell upon no ears save my own all at once however my attention was fixed with a start as i fancied that i heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the cavern was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon had then all my horrible apprehensions been for naught and was the guide having marked my unwarranted absence from the party following my course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain i was on the point of renewing my cries in order that my discovery might come the sooner when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as i listened for my ever acute ear now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence of the cave bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and dreadful knowledge that these footfalls werenot like those of any mortal manin the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region the tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive blows these impacts were soft and stealthy as of the padded paws of some feline besidesat timeswhen i listened carefully i seemed to trace the falls offourinstead oftwofeeti was now convinced that i had by my cries aroused and attracted some wild beast perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the cave perhaps i considered the almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that of hunger yet the instinct of selfpreservation never wholly dormant was stirred in my breast and though escape from the oncoming peril might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end i determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as i could command strange as it may seem my mind conceived of no intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility accordingly i became very quiet in the hope that the unknown beast would in the absence of a guiding sound lose its direction as had i and thus pass me by but this hope was not destined for realisation for the strange footfalls steadily advanced the animal evidently having obtained my scent which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as is that of the cave could doubtless be followed at great distanceseeing therefore that i must be armed for defence against an uncanny and unseen attack in the dark i grouped about me the largest of the fragments of rock which were strown upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the vicinity and grasping one in each hand for immediate use awaited with resignation the inevitable result meanwhile the hideous pattering of the paws drew near certainly the conduct of the creature was exceedingly strange most of the time the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped walking with a singularlack of unisonbetwixt hind and fore feet yet at brief and infrequent intervals i fancied that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion i wondered what species of animal was to confront me it must i thought be some unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a lifelong confinement in its interminable recesses it doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish bats and rats of the cave as well as some of the ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of green river which communicates in some occult manner with the waters of the cave i occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alterations cave life might have wrought in the physical structure of the beast remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cavern then i remembered with a start that even should i succeed in killing my antagonist i shouldnever behold its formas my torch had long since been extinct and i was entirely unprovided with matches the tension on my brain now became frightful my disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me and that actually seemed topressupon my body nearer nearer the dreadful footfalls approached it seemed that i must give vent to a piercing scream yet had i been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing my voice could scarce have responded i was petrified rooted to the spot i doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive now the steadypat patof the steps was close at hand nowveryclose i could hear the laboured breathing of the animal and terrorstruck as i was i realised that it must have come from a considerable distance and was correspondingly fatigued suddenly the spell broke my right hand guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing threw with full force the sharpangled bit of limestone which it contained toward that point in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering and wonderful to relate it nearly reached its goal for i heard the thing jump landing at a distance away where it seemed to pausehaving readjusted my aim i discharged my second missile this time most effectively for with a flood of joy i listened as the creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me i reeled back against the wall the breathing continued in heavy gasping inhalations and expirations whence i realised that i had no more than wounded the creature and now all desire to examine thethingceased at last something allied to groundless superstitious fear had entered my brain and i did not approach the body nor did i continue to cast stones at it in order to complete the extinction of its life instead i ran at full speed in what was as nearly as i could estimate in my frenzied condition the direction from which i had come suddenly i heard a sound or rather a regular succession of sounds in another instant they had resolved themselves into a series of sharp metallic clicks this time there was no doubtit was the guideand then i shouted yelled screamed even shrieked with joy as i beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering effulgence which i knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch i ran to meet the flare and before i could completely understand what had occurred was lying upon the ground at the feet of the guide embracing his boots and gibbering despite my boasted reserve in a most meaningless and idiotic manner pouring out my terrible story and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with protestations of gratitude at length i awoke to something like my normal consciousness the guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party at the entrance of the cave and had from his own intuitive sense of direction proceeded to make a thorough canvass of the bypassages just ahead of where he had last spoken to me locating my whereabouts after a quest of about four hoursby the time he had related this to me i emboldened by his torch and his company began to reflect upon the strange beast which i had wounded but a short distance back in the darkness and suggested that we ascertain by the rushlights aid what manner of creature was my victim accordingly i retraced my steps this time with a courage born of companionship to the scene of my terrible experience soon we descried a white object upon the floor an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself cautiously advancing we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment for of all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld this was in surpassing degree the strangest it appeared to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions escaped perhaps from some itinerant menagerie its hair was snowwhite a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the cave but it was also surprisingly thin being indeed largely absent save on the head where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in considerable profusion the face was turned away from us as the creature lay almost directly upon it the inclination of the limbs was very singular explaining however the alternation in their use which i had before noted whereby the beast used sometimes all four and on other occasions but two for its progress from the tips of the fingers or toes long naillike claws extended the hands or feet were not prehensile a fact that i ascribed to that long residence in the cave which as i before mentioned seemed evident from the allpervading and almost unearthlywhitenessso characteristic of the whole anatomy no tail seemed to be presentthe respiration had now grown very feeble and the guide had drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature when a suddensoundemitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused the sound was of a nature difficult to describe it was not like the normal note of any known species of simian and i wondered if this unnatural quality were not the result of a longcontinued and complete silence broken by the sensations produced by the advent of the light a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first entrance into the cave the sound which i might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of deeptoned chattering was faintly continued all at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of the beast the paws went through a convulsive motion and the limbs contracted with a jerk the white body rolled over so that its face was turned in our direction for a moment i was so struck with horror at the eyes thus revealed that i noted nothing else they were black those eyes deep jetty black in hideous contrast to the snowwhite hair and flesh like those of other cave denizens they were deeply sunken in their orbits and were entirely destitute of iris as i looked more closely i saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the average ape and infinitely more hairy the nose was quite distinctas we gazed upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision the thick lips opened and severalsoundsissued from them after which thethingrelaxed in deaththe guide clutched my coatsleeve and trembled so violently that the light shook fitfully casting weird moving shadows on the walls about usi made no motion but stood rigidly still my horrified eyes fixed upon the floor aheadthen fear left and wonder awe compassion and reverence succeeded in its place for thesoundsuttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth the creature i had killed the strange beast of the unfathomed cave was or had at one time been a man,1
i have an exposition of sleep come upon meshakespearei have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams and of the obscure world to which they belong whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiencesfreud to the contrary with his puerile symbolismthere are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier from my experience i cannot doubt but that man when lost to terrestrial consciousness is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much yet prove little we may guess that in dreams life matter and vitality as the earth knows such things are not necessarily constant and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenonit was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that i arose one afternoon in the winter of 19001901 when to the state psychopathic institution in which i served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly his name as given on the records was joe slater or slaader and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the catskill mountain region one of those strange repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a littletravelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts among these odd folk who correspond exactly to the decadent element of white trash in the south law and morals are nonexistent and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of the native american peoplejoe slater who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state policemen and who was described as a highly dangerous character certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when first i beheld him though well above the middle stature and of somewhat brawny frame he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes the scantiness of his neglected and nevershaven growth of yellow beard and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip his age was unknown since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist but from the baldness of his head in front and from the decayed condition of his teeth the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about fortyfrom the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case this man a vagabond hunter and trapper had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates he had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace not that his form of language was at all unusual for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness that none might listen without apprehension he himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said or at least all that had caused him to say what he did relapsing into a bovine halfamiable normality like that of the other hilldwellersas slater grew older it appeared his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities one day near noon after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon the man had roused himself most suddenly with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabina filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself rushing out into the snow he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air the while shouting his determination to reach some big big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor and the loud queer music far away as two men of moderate size sought to restrain him he had struggled with maniacal force and fury screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain thing that shines and shakes and laughs at length after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness shrieking fiendishly that he would jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him family and neighbours had now fled in a panic and when the more courageous of them returned slater was gone leaving behind an unrecognisable pulplike thing that had been a living man but an hour before none of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ravine they realised that he had somehow managed to survive and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary then had followed an armed searching party whose purpose whatever it may have been originally became that of a sheriffs posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed then questioned and finally joined the seekerson the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree and taken to the nearest gaol where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned to them he told a simple story he had he said gone to sleep one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor he had awaked to find himself standing bloodyhanded in the snow before his cabin the mangled corpse of his neighbour peter slader at his feet horrified he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime beyond these things he seemed to know nothing nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact that night slater slept quietly and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression dr barnard who had been watching the patient thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening as if of intelligent determination but when questioned slater relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer and only reiterated what he had said on the preceding dayon the third morning occurred the first of the mans mental attacks after some show of uneasiness in sleep he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a straitjacket the alienists listened with keen attention to his words since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbours slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes babbling in his backwoods dialect of great edifices of light oceans of space strange music and shadowy mountains and valleys but most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him this vast vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire in order to reach it he said he would soar through abysses of emptinessburningevery obstacle that stood in his way thus ran his discourse until with the greatest suddenness he ceased the fire of madness died from his eyes and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound dr barnard unbuckled the leathern harness and did not restore it till night when he succeeded in persuading slater to don it of his own volition for his own good the man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queerly though he knew not whywithin a week two more attacks appeared but from them the doctors learned little on thesourceof slaters visions they speculated at length for since he could neither read nor write and had apparently never heard a legend or fairy tale his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable that it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner he raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret things which he claimed to have experienced but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration the alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man with due formality slater was tried for murder acquitted on the ground of insanity and committed to the institution wherein i held so humble a posti have said that i am a constant speculator concerning dream life and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which i applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as i had fully ascertained the facts of his case he seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me born no doubt of the interest i could not conceal and the gentle manner in which i questioned him not that he ever recognised me during his attacks when i hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic wordpictures but he knew me in his quiet hours when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never enjoy again his family never called to see him probably it had found another temporary head after the manner of decadent mountain folkby degrees i commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of joe slater the man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike but his glowing titanic visions though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive how i often asked myself could the stolid imagination of a catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius how could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which slater ranted in his furious delirium more and more i inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleaguesand yet i could extract nothing definite from the man the sum of all my investigation was that in a kind of semiuncorporeal dream life slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys meadows gardens cities and palaces of light in a region unbounded and unknown to man that there he was no peasant or degenerate but a creature of importance and vivid life moving proudly and dominantly and checked only by a certain deadly enemy who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure and who did not appear to be of human shape since slater never referred to it as amanor as aught save athingthisthinghad done slater some hideous but unnamed wrong which the maniac if maniac he were yearned to avenge from the manner in which slater alluded to their dealings i judged that he and the luminousthinghad met on equal terms that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminousthingof the same race as his enemy this impression was sustained by his frequent references toflying through spaceandburningall that impeded his progress yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dreamworld indeed existed oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought could it be that the dreamsoul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter could it be that i was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if i could but learn to discover and read them i did not tell the older physicians of these things for middle age is sceptical cynical and disinclined to accept new ideas besides the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that i was overworking that my mind needed a restit had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat light and electricity this belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus and i had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude preradio period these i had tested with a fellowstudent but achieving no result had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use now in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of joe slater i sought these instruments again and spent several days in repairing them for action when they were complete once more i missed no opportunity for their trial at each outburst of slaters violence i would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wavelengths of intellectual energy i had but little notion of how the thoughtimpressions would if successfully conveyed arouse an intelligent response in my brain but i felt certain that i could detect and interpret them accordingly i continued my experiments though informing no one of their natureit was on the twentyfirst of february 1901 that the thing finally occurred as i look back across the years i realise how unreal it seems and sometimes half wonder if old dr fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination i recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when i told him but afterward gave me a nervepowder and arranged for the halfyears vacation on which i departed the next week that fateful night i was wildly agitated and perturbed for despite the excellent care he had received joe slater was unmistakably dying perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body he was drowsy near the end and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep i did not strap on the straitjacket as was customary when he slept since i saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away but i did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic radio hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dreamworld in the brief time remaining in the cell with us was one nurse a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus or think to inquire into my course as the hours wore on i saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep but i did not disturb him i myself lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man must have nodded a little laterthe sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me chords vibrations and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty walls columns and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where i seemed to float in air extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour blending with this display of palatial magnificence or rather supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys high mountains and inviting grottoes covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of yet formed wholly of some glowing ethereal plastic entity which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter as i gazed i perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses for each vista which appeared to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger for each sight and sound was familiar to me just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before and would be for like eternities to comethen the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me soul to soul with silent and perfect interchange of thought the hour was one of approaching triumph for was not my fellowbeing escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage escaping forever and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres we floated thus for a little time when i perceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us as though some force were recalling me to earthwhere i least wished to go the form near me seemed to feel a change also for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion and itself prepared to quit the scene fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects a few more thoughts were exchanged and i knew that the luminous one and i were being recalled to bondage though for my brother of light it would be the last time the sorry planetshell being wellnigh spent in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinitya welldefined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as i saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly joe slater was indeed awaking though probably for the last time as i looked more closely i saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of colour which had never before been present the lips too seemed unusual being tightly compressed as if by the force of a stronger character than had been slaters the whole face finally began to grow tense and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes i did not arouse the sleeping nurse but readjusted the slightly disarranged headbands of my telepathic radio intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld the man who had been joe slater the catskill decadent was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze and i felt beyond a doubt that i was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high orderat this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it i closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly and was rewarded by the positive knowledge thatmy longsought mental message had come at lasteach transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind and though no actual language was employed my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary englishjoe slater is deadcame the soulpetrifying voice or agency from beyond the wall of sleep my opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious horror but the blue eyes were still calmly gazing and the countenance was still intelligently animated he is better dead for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of cosmic entity his gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments between ethereal life and planet life he was too much of an animal too little a man yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me for the cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet he has been my torment and diurnal prison for fortytwo of your terrestrial years i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep i am your brother of light and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys it is not permitted me to tell your waking earthself of your real self but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travellers in many ages next year i may be dwelling in the dark egypt which you call ancient or in the cruel empire of tsanchan which is to come three thousand years hence you and i have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red arcturus and dwelt in the bodies of the insectphilosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of jupiter how little does the earthself know of life and its extent how little indeed ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presenceyou who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name ofalgol the daemonstarit is to meet and conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for aeons held back by bodily encumbrances tonight i go as a nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeancewatch me in the sky close by the daemonstari cannot speak longer for the body of joe slater grows cold and rigid and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as i wish you have been my friend in the cosmos you have been my only friend on this planetthe only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form which lies on this couch we shall meet againperhaps in the shining mists of orions sword perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric asia perhaps in unremembered dreams tonight perhaps in some other form an aeon hence when the solar system shall have been swept awayat this point the thoughtwaves abruptly ceased and the pale eyes of the dreameror can i say dead mancommenced to glaze fishily in a halfstupor i crossed over to the couch and felt of his wrist but found it cold stiff and pulseless the sallow cheeks paled again and the thick lips fell open disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate joe slater i shivered pulled a blanket over the hideous face and awakened the nurse then i left the cell and went silently to my room i had an insistent and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams i should not rememberthe climax what plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect i have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts allowing you to construe them as you will as i have already admitted my superior old dr fenton denies the reality of everything i have related he vows that i was broken down with nervous strain and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me he assures me on his professional honour that joe slater was but a lowgrade paranoiac whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folktales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities all this he tells meyet i cannot forget what i saw in the sky on the night after slater died lest you think me a biassed witness anothers pen must add this final testimony which may perhaps supply the climax you expect i will quote the following account of the starnova perseiverbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority prof garrett p servisson february 22 1901 a marvellous new star was discovered by dr anderson of edinburghnot very far from algolno star had been visible at that point before within twentyfour hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella in a week or two it had visibly faded and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye,1
my memories are very confused there is even much doubt as to where they begin for at times i feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me while at other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey formless infinity i am not even certain how i am communicating this message while i know i am speaking i have a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what i say to the points where i wish to be heard my identity too is bewilderingly cloudy i seem to have suffered a great shockperhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique incredible experiencethese cycles of experience of course all stem from that wormriddled book i remember when i found itin a dimly lighted place near the black oily river where the mists always swirl that place was very old and the ceilinghigh shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves there were besides great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins and it was in one of these heaps that i found the thing i never learned its title for the early pages were missing but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reelingthere was a formulaa sort of list of things to say and dowhich i recognised as something black and forbidden something which i had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universes guarded secrets whose decaying texts i loved to absorb it was a keya guideto certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it but this book was very old indeed no printingpress but the hand of some halfcrazed monk had traced these ominous latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquityi remember how the old man leered and tittered and made a curious sign with his hand when i bore it away he had refused to take pay for it and only long afterward did i guess why as i hurried home through those narrow winding mistchoked waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet the centuried tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignityas if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened i felt that those walls and overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungous plaster and timberwith fishy eyelike diamondpaned windows that leeredcould hardly desist from advancing and crushing me yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it awayi remember how i read the book at lastwhitefaced and locked in the attic room that i had long devoted to strange searchings the great house was very still for i had not gone up till after midnight i think i had a family thenthough the details are very uncertainand i know there were many servants just what the year was i cannot say for since then i have known many ages and dimensions and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned it was by the light of candles that i readi recall the relentless dripping of the waxand there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries i seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness as if i feared to hear some very remote intruding note among themthen came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city it came as i droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay and i knew amidst my shudders what it meant for he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow and never again can he be alone i had evokedand the book was indeed all i had suspected that night i passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision and when morning found me in the attic room i saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which i had never seen beforenor could i ever after see the world as i had known it mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future and every oncefamiliar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight from then on i walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and halfknown shapes and with each new gateway crossed the less plainly could i recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which i had so long been bound what i saw about me none else saw and i grew doubly silent and aloof lest i be thought mad dogs had a fear of me for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side but still i read morein hidden forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led meand pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and lifepatterns toward the core of the unknown cosmosi remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought the walls melted away and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needlelike pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me after a while there was utter blackness and then the light of myriad stars forming strange alien constellations finally i saw a greenlitten plain far below me and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion i had ever known or read of or dreamed of as i floated closer to that city i saw a great square building of stone in an open space and felt a hideous fear clutching at me i screamed and struggled and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor in that nights wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former nights wandering but there was more of terror because i knew i was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than i had ever been before thereafter i was more cautious with my incantations for i had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence i could never return,1

mythical beings of all sorts and kinds algernon blackwoodithe horror in claythe most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark agetheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents they have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism but it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when i think of it and maddens me when i dream of it that glimpse like all dread glimpses of truth flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated thingsin this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor i hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out certainly if i live i shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain i think that the professor too intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized himmy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 192627 with the death of my granduncle george gammell angell professor emeritus of semitic languages in brown university providence rhode island professor angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums so that his passing at the age of ninetytwo may be recalled by many locally interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat falling suddenly as witnesses said after having been jostled by a nauticallooking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceaseds home in williams street physicians were unable to find any visible disorder but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man was responsible for the end at the time i saw no reason to dissent from this dictum but latterly i am inclined to wonderand more than wonderas my granduncles heir and executor for he died a childless widower i was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in boston much of the material which i correlated will be later published by the american archaeological society but there was one box which i found exceedingly puzzling and which i felt much averse from shewing to other eyes it had been locked and i did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket then indeed i succeeded in opening it but when i did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier for what could be the meaning of the queer clay basrelief and the disjointed jottings ramblings and cuttings which i found had my uncle in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures i resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old mans peace of mindthe basrelief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area obviously of modern origin its designs however were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing and writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be though my memory despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle failed in any way to identify this particular species or even to hint at its remotest affiliationsabove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature it seemed to be a sort of monster or symbol representing a monster of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive if i say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus a dragon and a human caricature i shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing a pulpy tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings but it was thegeneral outlineof the whole which made it most shockingly frightful behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a cyclopean architectural backgroundthe writing accompanying this oddity was aside from a stack of press cuttings in professor angells most recent hand and made no pretence to literary style what seemed to be the main document was headed cthulhu cult in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheardof the manuscript was divided into two sections the first of which was headed 1925dream and dream work of h a wilcox 7 thomas st providence ri and the second narrative of inspector john r legrasse 121 bienville st new orleans la at 1908 a a s mtgnotes on same prof webbs acct the other manuscript papers were all brief notes some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines notably w scottelliotsatlantis and the lost lemuria and the rest comments on longsurviving secret societies and hidden cults with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological sourcebooks as frazersgolden boughand miss murrayswitchcult in western europethe cuttings largely alluded to outr mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925the first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale it appears that on march 1st 1925 a thin dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon professor angell bearing the singular clay basrelief which was then exceedingly damp and fresh his card bore the name of henry anthony wilcox and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him who had latterly been studying sculpture at the rhode island school of design and living alone at the fleurdelys building near that institution wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating he called himself psychically hypersensitive but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely queer never mingling much with his kind he had dropped gradually from social visibility and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns even the providence art club anxious to preserve its conservatism had found him quite hopelesson the occasion of the visit ran the professors manuscript the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his hosts archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the basrelief he spoke in a dreamy stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology young wilcoxs rejoinder which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation and which i have since found highly characteristic of him he said it is new indeed for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities and dreams are older than brooding tyre or the contemplative sphinx or gardengirdled babylonit was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle there had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before the most considerable felt in new england for some years and wilcoxs imagination had been keenly affected upon retiring he had had an unprecedented dream of great cyclopean cities of titan blocks and skyflung monoliths all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters cthulhu fhtagnthis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell he questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness and studied with almost frantic intensity the basrelief on which the youth had found himself working chilled and clad only in his nightclothes when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him my uncle blamed his old age wilcox afterward said for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design many of his questions seemed highly outofplace to his visitor especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body when professor angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams this bore regular fruit for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical senseimpacts uninscribable save as gibberish the two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters cthulhu and rlyehon march 23d the manuscript continued wilcox failed to appear and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in waterman street he had cried out in the night arousing several other artists in the building and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium my uncle at once telephoned the family and from that time forward kept close watch of the case calling often at the thayer street office of dr tobey whom he learned to be in charge the youths febrile mind apparently was dwelling on strange things and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them they included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed but touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered about he at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words as repeated by dr tobey convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dreamsculpture reference to this object the doctor added was invariably a prelude to the young mans subsidence into lethargy his temperature oddly enough was not greatly above normal but his whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorderon april 2nd at about 3 pm every trace of wilcoxs malady suddenly ceased he sat upright in bed astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of march 22nd pronounced well by his physician he returned to his quarters in three days but to professor angell he was of no further assistance all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery and my uncle kept no record of his nightthoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visionshere the first part of the manuscript ended but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thoughtso much in fact that only the ingrained scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist the notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young wilcox had had his strange visitations my uncle it seems had quickly instituted a prodigiously farflung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence asking for nightly reports of their dreams and the dates of any notable visions for some time past the reception of his request seems to have been varied but he must at the very least have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary this original correspondence was not preserved but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest average people in society and businessnew englands traditional salt of the earthgave an almost completely negative result though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there always between march 23d and april 2ndthe period of young wilcoxs delirium scientific men were little more affected though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormalit was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came and i know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes as it was lacking their original letters i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see that is why i continued to feel that wilcox somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed had been imposing on the veteran scientist these responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale from february 28th to april 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptors delirium over a fourth of those who reported anything reported scenes and halfsounds not unlike those which wilcox had described and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last one case which the note describes with emphasis was very sad the subject a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism went violently insane on the date of young wilcoxs seizure and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number i should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation but as it was i succeeded in tracing down only a few all of these however bore out the notes in full i have often wondered if all the objects of the professors questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction it is well that no explanation shall ever reach themthe press cuttings as i have intimated touched on cases of panic mania and eccentricity during the given period professor angell must have employed a cutting bureau for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe here was a nocturnal suicide in london where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in south america where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen a despatch from california describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some glorious fulfilment which never arrives whilst items from india speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of march voodoo orgies multiply in hayti and african outposts report ominous mutterings american officers in the philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time and new york policemen are mobbed by hysterical levantines on the night of march 2223 the west of ireland too is full of wild rumour and legendry and a fantastic painter named ardoisbonnot hangs a blasphemous dream landscape in the paris spring salon of 1926 and so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions a weird bunch of cuttings all told and i can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which i set them aside but i was then convinced that young wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professoriithe tale of inspector legrassethe older matters which had made the sculptors dream and basrelief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript once before it appears professor angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as cthulhu and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young wilcox with queries and demands for datathe earlier experience had come in 1908 seventeen years before when the american archaeological society held its annual meeting in st louis professor angell as befitted one of his authority and attainments had had a prominent part in all the deliberations and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solutionthe chief of these outsiders and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting was a commonplacelooking middleaged man who had travelled all the way from new orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source his name was john raymond legrasse and he was by profession an inspector of police with him he bore the subject of his visit a grotesque repulsive and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine it must not be fancied that inspector legrasse had the least interest in archaeology on the contrary his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations the statuette idol fetish or whatever it was had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of new orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the african voodoo circles of its origin apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members absolutely nothing was to be discovered hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol and through it track down the cult to its fountainheadinspector legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created one sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stonethe figure which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study was between seven and eight inches in height and of exquisitely artistic workmanship it represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass of feelers a scaly rubberylooking body prodigious claws on hind and fore feet and long narrow wings behind this thing which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy was of a somewhat bloated corpulence and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters the tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block the seat occupied the centre whilst the long curved claws of the doubledup crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal the cephalopod head was bent forward so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the crouchers elevated knees the aspect of the whole was abnormally lifelike and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown its vast awesome and incalculable age was unmistakable yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisations youthor indeed to any other time totally separate and apart its very material was a mystery for the soapy greenishblack stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy the characters along the base were equally baffling and no member present despite a representation of half the worlds expert learning in this field could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship they like the subject and material belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no partand yet as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspectors problem there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew this person was the late william channing webb professor of anthropology in princeton university and an explorer of no slight note professor webb had been engaged fortyeight years before in a tour of greenland and iceland in search of some runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth and whilst high up on the west greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate esquimaux whose religion a curious form of devilworship chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness it was a faith of which other esquimaux knew little and which they mentioned only with shudders saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil ortornasukand of this professor webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an agedangekokor wizardpriest expressing the sounds in roman letters as best he knew how but just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs it was the professor stated a very crude basrelief of stone comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing and so far as he could tell it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meetingthis data received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members proved doubly exciting to inspector legrasse and he began at once to ply his informant with questions having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cultworshippers his men had arrested he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist esquimaux there then followed an exhaustive comparison of details and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart what in substance both the esquimau wizards and the louisiana swamppriests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like thisthe worddivisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloudphnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagnlegrasse had one point in advance of professor webb for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant this text as given ran something like thisin his house at rlyeh dead cthulhu waits dreamingand now in response to a general and urgent demand inspector legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers telling a story to which i could see my uncle attached profound significance it savoured of the wildest dreams of mythmaker and theosophist and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such halfcastes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess iton november 1st 1907 there had come to the new orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south the squatters there mostly primitive but goodnatured descendants of lafittes men were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night it was voodoo apparently but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tomtom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured there were insane shouts and harrowing screams soulchilling chants and dancing devilflames and the frightened messenger added the people could stand it no moreso a body of twenty police filling two carriages and an automobile had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide at the end of the passable road they alighted and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of spanish moss beset them and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create at length the squatter settlement a miserable huddle of huts hove in sight and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns the muffled beat of tomtoms was now faintly audible far far ahead and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted a reddish glare too seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night reluctant even to be left alone again each one of the cowed squatters refused pointblank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship so inspector legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod beforethe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute substantially unknown and untraversed by white men there were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight in which dwelt a huge formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes and squatters whispered that batwinged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight they said it had been there before diberville before la salle before the indians and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods it was nightmare itself and to see it was to die but it made men dream and so they knew enough to keep away the present voodoo orgy was indeed on the merest fringe of this abhorred area but that location was bad enough hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidentsonly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by legrasses men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tomtoms there are vocal qualities peculiar to men and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other animal fury and orgiastic licence here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell now and then the less organised ululation would cease and from what seemed a welldrilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong chant that hideous phrase or ritualphnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagnthen the men having reached a spot where the trees were thinner came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself four of them reeled one fainted and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horrorin a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acres extent clear of trees and tolerably dry on this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a sime or an angarola could paint void of clothing this hybrid spawn were braying bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ringshaped bonfire in the centre of which revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height on top of which incongruous with its diminutiveness rested the noxious carven statuette from a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flamegirt monolith as a centre hung head downward the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared it was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fireit may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men an excitable spaniard to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror this man joseph d galvez i later met and questioned and he proved distractingly imaginative he indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest treesbut i suppose he had been hearing too much native superstitionactually the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration duty came first and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout for five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description wild blows were struck shots were fired and escapes were made but in the end legrasse was able to count some fortyseven sullen prisoners whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen five of the worshippers lay dead and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellowprisoners the image on the monolith of course was carefully removed and carried back by legrasseexamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low mixedblooded and mentally aberrant type most were seamen and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes largely west indians or brava portuguese from the cape verde islands gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult but before many questions were asked it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro fetichism was involved degraded and ignorant as they were the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faiththey worshipped so they said the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men and who came to the young world out of the sky those old ones were gone now inside the earth and under the sea but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men who formed a cult which had never died this was that cult and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu from his dark house in the mighty city of rlyeh under the waters should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway some day he would call when the stars were ready and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate himmeanwhile no more must be told there was a secret which even torture could not extract mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few but these were not the great old ones no man had ever seen the old ones the carven idol was great cthulhu but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him no one could read the old writing now but things were told by word of mouth the chanted ritual was not the secretthat was never spoken aloud only whispered the chant meant only this in his house at rlyeh dead cthulhu waits dreamingonly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged and the rest were committed to various institutions all denied a part in the ritual murders and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial meetingplace in the haunted wood but of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained what the police did extract came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named castro who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of chinaold castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed there had been aeons when other things ruled on the earth and they had had great cities remains of them he said the deathless chinamen had told him were still to be found as cyclopean stones on islands in the pacific they all died vast epochs of time before men came but there were arts which could revive them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity they had indeed come themselves from the stars and brought their images with themthese great old ones castro continued were not composed altogether of flesh and blood they had shapefor did not this starfashioned image prove itbut that shape was not made of matter when the stars were right they could plunge from world to world through the sky but when the stars were wrong they could not live but although they no longer lived they would never really die they all lay in stone houses in their great city of rlyeh preserved by the spells of mighty cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for them but at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate their bodies the spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented them from making an initial move and they could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by they knew all that was occurring in the universe but their mode of speech was transmitted thought even now they talked in their tombs when after infinities of chaos the first men came the great old ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams for only thus could their language reach the fleshly minds of mammalsthen whispered castro those first men formed the cult around small idols which the great ones shewed them idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars that cult would never die till the stars came right again and the secret priests would take great cthulhu from his tomb to revive his subjects and resume his rule of earth the time would be easy to know for then mankind would have become as the great old ones free and wild and beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy then the liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom meanwhile the cult by appropriate rites must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their returnin the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed old ones in dreams but then something had happened the great stone city rlyeh with its monoliths and sepulchres had sunk beneath the waves and the deep waters full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass had cut off the spectral intercourse but memory never died and highpriests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth mouldy and shadowy and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten seabottoms but of them old castro dared not speak much he cut himself off hurriedly and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction thesizeof the old ones too he curiously declined to mention of the cult he said that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of arabia where irem the city of pillars dreams hidden and untouched it was not allied to the european witchcult and was virtually unknown beyond its members no book had ever really hinted of it though the deathless chinamen said that there were double meanings in thenecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose especially the muchdiscussed coupletthat is not dead which can eternal lieand with strange aeons even death may dielegrasse deeply impressed and not a little bewildered had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult castro apparently had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret the authorities at tulane university could shed no light upon either cult or image and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the greenland tale of professor webbthe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by legrasses tale corroborated as it was by the statuette is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture legrasse for some time lent the image to professor webb but at the latters death it was returned to him and remains in his possession where i viewed it not long ago it is truly a terrible thing and unmistakably akin to the dreamsculpture of young wilcoxthat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor i did not wonder for what thoughts must arise upon hearing after a knowledge of what legrasse had learned of the cult of a sensitive young man who haddreamednot only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swampfound image and the greenland devil tablet but had comein his dreamsupon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by esquimau diabolists and mongrel louisianans professor angells instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural though privately i suspected young wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncles expense the dreamnarratives and cuttings collected by the professor were of course strong corroboration but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what i thought the most sensible conclusions so after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of legrasse i made a trip to providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke i thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged manwilcox still lived alone in the fleurdelys building in thomas street a hideous victorian imitation of seventeenthcentury breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill and under the very shadow of the finest georgian steeple in america i found him at work in his rooms and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic he will i believe some time be heard from as one of the great decadents for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in paintingdark frail and somewhat unkempt in aspect he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising when i told him who i was he displayed some interest for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams yet had never explained the reason for the study i did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard but sought with some subtlety to draw him out in a short time i became convinced of his absolute sincerity for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake they and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion he could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream basrelief but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands it was no doubt the giant shape he had raved of in delirium that he really knew nothing of the hidden cult save from what my uncles relentless catechism had let fall he soon made clear and again i strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressionshe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion making me see with terrible vividness the damp cyclopean city of slimy green stonewhosegeometryhe oddly said wasall wrongand hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless halfmental calling from underground cthulhu fhtagn cthulhu fhtagn these words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead cthulhus dreamvigil in his stone vault at rlyeh and i felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs wilcox i was sure had heard of the cult in some casual way and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining later by virtue of its sheer impressiveness it had found subconscious expression in dreams in the basrelief and in the terrible statue i now beheld so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one the youth was of a type at once slightly affected and slightly illmannered which i could never like but i was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty i took leave of him amicably and wish him all the success his talent promisesthe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions i visited new orleans talked with legrasse and others of that oldtime raidingparty saw the frightful image and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived old castro unfortunately had been dead for some years what i now heard so graphically at firsthand though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written excited me afresh for i felt sure that i was on the track of a very real very secret and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note my attitude was still one of absolute materialismas i wish it still wereand i discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by professor angellone thing i began to suspect and which i now fear iknowis that my uncles death was far from natural he fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels after a careless push from a negro sailor i did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cultmembers in louisiana and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and beliefs legrasse and his men it is true have been let alone but in norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptors data have come to sinister ears i think professor angell died because he knew too much or because he was likely to learn too much whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen for i have learned much nowiiithe madness from the seaif heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelfpaper it was nothing on which i would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round for it was an old number of an australian journal thesydney bulletinfor april 18 1925 it had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncles researchi had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the cthulhu cult and was visiting a learned friend in paterson new jersey the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones it was thesydney bulletini have mentioned for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts and the picture was a halftone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which legrasse had found in the swampeagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents i scanned the item in detail and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length what it suggested however was of portentous significance to my flagging quest and i carefully tore it out for immediate action it read as followsmystery derelict found at seavigilant arrives with helpless armed new zealand yacht in towone survivor and dead man found aboard tale ofdesperate

complete bafflement and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht in a small carved shrine of common patternthis man after recovering his senses told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter he is gustaf johansen a norwegian of some intelligence and had been second mate of the twomasted schooneremmaof auckland which sailed for callao february 20th with a complement of eleven men theemmahe says was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of march 1st and on march 22nd in s latitude 49 51 w longitude 128 34 encountered thealertmanned by a queer and evillooking crew of kanakas and halfcastes being ordered peremptorily to turn back capt collins refused whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yachts equipment theemmasmen shewed fight says the survivor and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her grappling with the savage crew on the yachts deck and being forced to kill them all the number being slightly superior because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fightingthree of theemmasmen including capt collins and first mate green were killed and the remaining eight under second mate johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed the next day it appears they raised and landed on a small island although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean and six of the men somehow died ashore though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm later it seems he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her but were beaten about by the storm of april 2nd from that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little and he does not even recall when william briden his companion died bridens death reveals no apparent cause and was probably due to excitement or exposure cable advices from dunedin report that thealertwas well known there as an island trader and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront it was owned by a curious group of halfcastes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of march 1st our auckland correspondent gives theemmaand her crew an excellent reputation and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man the admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow at which every effort will be made to induce johansen to speak more freely than he has done hithertothis was all together with the picture of the hellish image but what a train of ideas it started in my mind here were new treasuries of data on the cthulhu cult and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land what motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back theemmaas they sailed about with their hideous idol what was the unknown island on which six of theemmascrew had died and about which the mate johansen was so secretive what had the viceadmiraltys investigation brought out and what was known of the noxious cult in dunedin and most marvellous of all what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my unclemarch 1stour february 28th according to the international date linethe earthquake and storm had come from dunedin thealertand her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange dank cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded cthulhu march 23d the crew of theemmalanded on an unknown island and left six men dead and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monsters malign pursuit whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium and what of this storm of april 2ndthe date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased and wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever what of all thisand of those hints of old castro about the sunken starborn old ones and their coming reign their faithful cultand their mastery of dreamswas i tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond mans power to bear if so they must be horrors of the mind alone for in some way the second of april had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankinds soulthat evening after a day of hurried cabling and arranging i bade my host adieu and took a train for san francisco in less than a month i was in dunedin where however i found that little was known of the strange cultmembers who had lingered in the old seataverns waterfront scum was far too common for special mention though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills in auckland i learned that johansen had returnedwith yellow hair turned whiteafter a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials and all they could do was to give me his oslo addressafter that i went to sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the viceadmiralty court i saw thealertnow sold and in commercial use at circular quay in sydney cove but gained nothing from its noncommittal bulk the crouching image with its cuttlefish head dragon body scaly wings and hieroglyphed pedestal was preserved in the museum at hyde park and i studied it long and well finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship and with the same utter mystery terrible antiquity and unearthly strangeness of material which i had noted in legrasses smaller specimen geologists the curator told me had found it a monstrous puzzle for they vowed that the world held no rock like it then i thought with a shudder of what old castro had told legrasse about the primal great ones they had come from the stars and had brought their images with themshaken with such a mental revolution as i had never before known i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo sailing for london i rembarked at once for the norwegian capital and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the egeberg johansens address i discovered lay in the old town of king harold haardrada which kept alive the name of oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as christiana i made the brief trip by taxicab and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front a sadfaced woman in black answered my summons and i was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting english that gustaf johansen was no morehe had not survived his return said his wife for the doings at sea in 1925 had broken him he had told her no more than he had told the public but had left a long manuscriptof technical matters as he saidwritten in english evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal during a walk through a narrow lane near the gothenburg dock a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down two lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead physicians found no adequate cause for the end and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitutioni now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till i too am at rest accidentally or otherwise persuading the widow that my connexion with her husbands technical matters was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript i bore the document away and began to read it on the london boat it was a simple rambling thinga naive sailors effort at a postfacto diaryand strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage i cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance but i will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessels sides became so unendurable to me that i stopped my ears with cottonjohansen thank god did not know quite all even though he saw the city and the thing but i shall never sleep calmly again when i think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and airjohansens voyage had begun just as he told it to the viceadmiralty theemmain ballast had cleared auckland on february 20th and had felt the full force of that earthquakeborn tempest which must have heaved up from the seabottom the horrors that filled mens dreams once more under control the ship was making good progress when held up by thealerton march 22nd and i could feel the mates regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking of the swarthy cultfiends on thealerthe speaks with significant horror there was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty and johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry then driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under johansens command the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea and in s latitude 47 9 w longitude 126 43 come upon a coastline of mingled mud ooze and weedy cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earths supreme terrorthe nightmare corpsecity of rlyeh that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars there lay great cthulhu and his hordes hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last after cycles incalculable the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration all this johansen did not suspect but god knows he soon saw enoughi suppose that only a single mountaintop the hideous monolithcrowned citadel whereon great cthulhu was buried actually emerged from the waters when i think of theextentof all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping babylon of elder daemons and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and basreliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on thealertis poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened descriptionwithout knowing what futurism is like johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city for instead of describing any definite structure or building he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfacessurfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs i mention his talk aboutanglesbecause it suggests something wilcox had told me of his awful dreams he had said that thegeometryof the dreamplace he saw was abnormal noneuclidean and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible realityjohansen and his men landed at a sloping mudbank on this monstrous acropolis and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase the very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this seasoaked perversion and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed convexitysomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others and it was only halfheartedly that they searchedvainly as it provedfor some portable souvenir to bear awayit was rodriguez the portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found the rest followed him and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squiddragon basrelief it was johansen said like a great barndoor and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel threshold and jambs around it though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trapdoor or slantwise like an outside cellardoor as wilcox would have said the geometry of the place was all wrong one could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variablebriden pushed at the stone in several places without result then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge pressing each point separately as he went he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone mouldingthat is one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontaland the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast then very softly and slowly the acregreat panel began to give inward at the top and they saw that it was balanced donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal in this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upsetthe aperture was black with a darkness almost material that tenebrousness was indeed apositive qualityfor it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeonlong imprisonment visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings the odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable and at length the quickeared hawkins thought he heard a nasty slopping sound down there everyone listened and everyone was listening still when it lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madnesspoor johansens handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this of the six men who never reached the ship he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant the thing cannot be describedthere is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy such eldritch contradictions of all matter force and cosmic order a mountain walked or stumbled god what wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad and poor wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant the thing of the idols the green sticky spawn of the stars had awaked to claim his own the stars were right again and what an ageold cult had failed to do by design a band of innocent sailors had done by accident after vigintillions of years great cthulhu was loose again and ravening for delightthree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned god rest them if there be any rest in the universe they were donovan guerrera and ngstrom parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of greencrusted rock to the boat and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldnt have been there an angle which was acute but behaved as if it were obtuse so only briden and johansen reached the boat and pulled desperately for thealertas the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the watersteam had not been suffered to go down entirely despite the departure of all hands for the shore and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get thealertunder way slowly amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene she began to churn the lethal waters whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus then bolder than the storied cyclops great cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast waveraising strokes of cosmic potency briden looked back and went mad laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriouslybut johansen had not given out yet knowing that the thing could surely overtake thealertuntil steam was fully up he resolved on a desperate chance and setting the engine for full speed ran lightninglike on deck and reversed the wheel there was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon the awful squidhead with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht but johansen drove on relentlessly there was a bursting as of an exploding bladder a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish a stench as of a thousand opened graves and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper for an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud and then there was only a venomous seething astern wheregod in heaventhe scattered plasticity of that nameless skyspawn was nebulouslyrecombiningin its hateful original form whilst its distance widened every second as thealertgained impetus from its mounting steamthat was all after that johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side he did not try to navigate after the first bold flight for the reaction had taken something out of his soul then came the storm of april 2nd and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness there is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted hilarious elder gods and the green batwinged mocking imps of tartarusout of that dream came rescuethevigilantthe viceadmiralty court the streets of dunedin and the long voyage back home to the old house by the egeberg he could not tellthey would think him mad he would write of what he knew before death came but his wife must not guess death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memoriesthat was the document i read and now i have placed it in the tin box beside the basrelief and the papers of professor angell with it shall go this record of minethis test of my own sanity wherein is pieced together that which i hope may never be pieced together again i have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me but i do not think my life will be long as my uncle went as poor johansen went so i shall go i know too much and the cult still livescthulhu still lives too i suppose again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young his accursed city is sunken once more for thevigilantsailed over the spot after the april storm but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idolcapped monoliths in lonely places he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy who knows the end what has risen may sink and what has sunk may rise loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men a time will comebut i must not and cannot think let me pray that if i do not survive this manuscript my executors may put caution before

been incineratedborellusi a result and a prologue1from a private hospital for the insane near providence rhode island there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person he bore the name of charles dexter ward and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological characterin the first place the patient seemed oddly older than his twentysix years would warrant mental disturbance it is true will age one rapidly but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire in the second place his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry the voice was lost so that no sounds above a whisper were possible digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded either normal or pathological the skin had a morbid chill and dryness and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before in general all physicians agree that in ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedentpsychologically too charles ward was unique his madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms dr willett who was wards family physician affirms that the patients gross mental capacity as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity had actually increased since the seizure ward it is true was always a scholar and an antiquarian but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists it was indeed a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem and only on the evidence of others and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence was he finally placed in confinement to the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted and shrewd observers failing to foresee his escape freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custodyonly dr willett who brought charles ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom he had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues willett indeed presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case he was the last to see the patient before his flight and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when wards escape became known three hours later that escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of dr waites hospital a window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it yet after that talk with willett the youth was undeniably gone willett himself has no public explanations to offer though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape many indeed feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him he had found ward in his room but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain when they opened the door the patient was not there and all they found was the open window with a chill april breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluishgrey dust that almost choked them true the dogs howled some time before but that was while willett was still present and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on wards father was told at once over the telephone but he seemed more saddened than surprised by the time dr waite called in person dr willett had been talking with him and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape only from certain closely confidential friends of willett and the senior ward have any clues been gained and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence the one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthedcharles ward was an antiquarian from infancy no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in prospect street on the crest of the hill with the years his devotion to ancient things increased so that history genealogy and the study of colonial architecture furniture and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests these tastes are important to remember in considering his madness for although they do not form its absolute nucleus they play a prominent part in its superficial form the gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of autohypnosis the odd thing was that ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well he had it appears lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain that this wholesale deletion had occurred he did his best to hide but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time alienists are now wondering how in view of his vitally impaired range of data the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normalthe beginning of wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists dr lyman the eminent boston authority places it in 1919 or 1920 during the boys last year at the moses brown school when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make this is certainly borne out by wards altered habits at the time especially by his continual search through town records and among old buryinggrounds for a certain grave dug in 1771 the grave of an ancestor named joseph curwen some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in olney court on stampers hill which curwen was known to have built and occupied it is broadly speaking undeniable that the winter of 191920 saw a great change in ward whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers gravefrom this opinion however dr willett substantially dissents basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him so that his voice trembles when he tells them and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them willett admits that the change of 191920 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928 but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made granting freely that the boy was always illbalanced temperamentally and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness crediting instead wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound the true madness he is certain came with a later change after the curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed after a trip to strange foreign places had been made and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances after certainanswersto these invocations had been plainly indicated and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions after the wave of vampirism and the ominous pawtuxet gossip and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticedit was only about this time willett points out with much acuteness that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with ward and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery in the first place two workmen of high intelligence saw joseph curwens ancient papers found secondly the boy once shewed dr willett those papers and a page of the curwen diary and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness the hole where ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality and willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the orne and hutchinson letters and the problem of the curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about dr allen these things and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experienceand most conclusive of all there are the two hideousresultswhich the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge2one must look back at charles wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly in the autumn of 1918 and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period he had begun his junior year at the moses brown school which lies very near his home the old main building erected in 1819 had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape his social activities were few and his hours were spent mainly at home in rambling walks in his classes and drills and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the city hall the state house the public library the athenaeum the historical society the john carter brown and john hay libraries of brown university and the newly opened shepley library in benefit street one may picture him yet as he was in those days tall slim and blond with studious eyes and a slight stoop dressed somewhat carelessly and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractivenesshis walks were always adventures in antiquity during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before his home was a great georgian mansion atop the wellnigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires domes roofs and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond here he was born and from the lovely classic porch of the doublebayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken and on toward the stately colleges along the shady sumptuous street whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow heavycolumned doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardenshe had been wheeled too along sleepy congdon street one tier lower down on the steep hill and with all its eastern homes on high terraces the small wooden houses averaged a greater age here for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village the nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of prospect terrace to chat with policemen and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment all violet and mystic against a fevered apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens the vast marble dome of the state house stood out in massive silhouette its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming skywhen he was larger his famous walks began first with his impatiently dragged nurse and then alone in dreamy meditation farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city he would hesitate gingerly down vertical jenckes street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady benefit street corner where before him was a wooden antique with an ionicpilastered pair of doorways and beside him a prehistoric gambrelroofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining and the great judge durfee house with its fallen vestiges of georgian grandeur it was getting to be a slum here but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the prerevolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals on the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps and the young charles could picture them as they were when the street was new and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visiblewestward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above down to the old town street that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636 here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning huddled houses of immense antiquity and fascinated though he was it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors he found it much less formidable to continue along benefit street past the iron fence of st johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 colony house and the mouldering bulk of the golden ball inn where washington stopped at meeting streetthe successive gaol lane and king street of other periodshe would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope and downward to the west glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient sign of shakespears head where theprovidence gazette and countryjournalwas printed before the revolution then came the exquisite first baptist church of 1775 luxurious with its matchless gibbs steeple and the georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west spectral in their manygabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud east india days amidst polyglot vice and squalor rotting wharves and bleareyed shipchandleries with such surviving alley names as packet bullion gold silver coin doubloon sovereign guilder dollar dime and centsometimes as he grew taller and more adventurous young ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses broken transoms tumbling steps twisted balustrades swarthy faces and nameless odours winding from south main to south water searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched and returning northward at this lower level past the steeproofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the great bridge where the 1773 market house still stands firm on its ancient arches in that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff decked with its two georgian spires and crowned by the vast new christian science dome as london is crowned by st pauls he liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon when the slanting sunlight touches the market house and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where providence indiamen used to ride at anchor after a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in smallpaned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wroughtiron railingsat other times and in later years he would seek for vivid contrasts spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home where the hill drops to the lower eminence of stampers hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the boston stage coach used to start before the revolution and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about george benevolent power and williams streets where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger these rambles together with the diligent studies which accompanied them certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from charles wards mind and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell in that fateful winter of 191920 the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruitiondr willett is certain that up to this illomened winter of first change charles wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid then by insidious degrees there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very longlived man named joseph curwen who had come from salem in march of 1692 and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clusteredwards greatgreatgrandfather welcome potter had in 1785 married a certain ann tillinghast daughter of mrs eliza daughter to capt james tillinghast of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace late in 1918 whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name by which in 1772 a mrs eliza curwen widow of joseph curwen resumed along with her sevenyearold daughter ann her maiden name of tillinghast on the ground that her husbands name was become a publick reproach by reason of what was knowne after his decease the which confirming an antient common rumour tho not to be credited by a loyall wife till so proven as to be wholely past doubting this entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbersit was at once clear to charles ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown greatgreatgreatgrandfather the discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person about whom there remained so few publicly available records aside from those becoming public only in modern times that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory what did appear moreover was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too validbefore this ward had been content to let his romancing about old joseph curwen remain in the idle stage but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently hushedup character he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him in this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations for old letters diaries and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy one important sidelight came from a point as remote as new york where some rhode island colonial correspondence was stored in the museum at fraunces tavern the really crucial thing though and what in dr willetts opinion formed the definite source of wards undoing was the matter found in august 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in olney court it was that beyond a doubt which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pitii an antecedent and a horror1joseph curwen as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what ward heard and unearthed was a very astonishing enigmatic and obscurely horrible individual he had fled from salem to providencethat universal haven of the odd the free and the dissentingat the beginning of the great witchcraft panic being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments he was a colourlesslooking man of about thirty and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of providence thereafter buying a home lot just north of gregory dexters at about the foot of olney street his house was built on stampers hill west of the town street in what later became olney court and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one on the same site which is still standingnow the first odd thing about joseph curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival he engaged in shipping enterprises purchased wharfage near mileend cove helped rebuild the great bridge in 1713 and in 1723 was one of the founders of the congregational church on the hill but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirtyfive as decades mounted up this singular quality began to excite wide notice but curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out how such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night was not very clear to the townsfolk and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity it was held for the most part that curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from london and the indies on his ships or purchased in newport boston and new york and when old dr jabez bowen came from rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the great bridge at the sign of the unicorn and mortar there was ceaseless talk of the drugs acids and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him acting on the assumption that curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a noncommittal way and always gave them oddcoloured potions in response to their requests it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit at length when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique the people began to whisper more darkly and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewnprivate letters and diaries of the period reveal too a multitude of other reasons why joseph curwen was marvelled at feared and finally shunned like a plague his passion for graveyards in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions was notorious though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish on the pawtuxet road he had a farm at which he generally lived during the summer and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night here his only visible servants farmers and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged narragansett indians the husband dumb and curiously scarred and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance probably due to a mixture of negro blood in the leanto of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles bags or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks crucibles alembics and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room and prophesied in whispers that the closemouthed chymistby which they meantalchemistwould not be long in finding the philosophers stone the nearest neighbours to this farmthe fenners a quarter of a mile awayhad still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the curwen place in the night there were cries they said and sustained howlings and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat milk and wool the identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the kingstown farmers then too there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windowsgreat bridge idlers likewise had much to say of curwens town house in olney court not so much the fine new one built in 1761 when the man must have been nearly a century old but the first low gambrelroofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition here there was less mystery it is true but the hours at which lights were seen the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged french housekeeper the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived and thequalityof certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times all combined with what was known of the pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad namein choicer circles too the curwen home was by no means undiscussed for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy his birth was known to be good since the curwens or corwins of salem needed no introduction in new england it developed that joseph curwen had travelled much in very early life living for a time in england and making at least two voyages to the orient and his speech when he deigned to use it was that of a learned and cultivated englishman but for some reason or other curwen did not care for society whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inanethere seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic sardonic arrogance as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities when dr checkley the famous wit came from boston in 1738 to be rector of kings church he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse charles ward told his father when they discussed curwen one winter evening that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric but that all diarists agree concerning dr checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard the good man had been hideously shocked and could never recall joseph curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famedmore definite however was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit in 1746 mr john merritt an elderly english gentleman of literary and scientific leanings came from newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing and built a fine country seat on the neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section he lived in considerable style and comfort keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town and taking great pride in his telescope his microscope and his wellchosen library of english and latin books hearing of curwen as the owner of the best library in providence mr merritt early paid him a call and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been his admiration for his hosts ample shelves which besides the greek latin and english classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical mathematical and scientific works including paracelsus agricola van helmont sylvius glauber boyle boerhaave becher and stahl led curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before and the two drove out at once in mr merritts coachmr merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical alchemical and theological subjects which curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing perhaps however the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice the bizarre collection besides a host of standard works which mr merritt was not too alarmed to envy embraced nearly all the cabbalists daemonologists and magicians known to man and was a treasurehouse of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology hermes trismegistus in mesnards

turned pale when upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as theqanooneislamhe found it was in truth the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of kingsport in the province of the massachusettsbaybut oddly enough the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail on the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of borellus bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in curwens hand the book was open at about its middle and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous penstrokes beneath the lines of mystic blackletter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through whether it was the nature of the passage underscored or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring he could not tell but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly he recalled it to the end of his days writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend dr checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector it readthe essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust a philosopher may without any criminal necromancy call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incineratedit was near the docks along the southerly part of the town street however that the worst things were muttered about joseph curwen sailors are superstitious folk and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum slave and molasses sloops the rakish privateers and the great brigs of the browns crawfords and tillinghasts all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim deceptively younglooking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the curwen warehouse in doubloon street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the curwen ships rode restlessly curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him and all his sailors were mongrel riffraff from martinique st eustatius havana or port royal it was in a way the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held a crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men that many of the errands had concerned the farm on the pawtuxet road and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place was not forgotten so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the providence wharves and their replacement in the west indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchantin 1760 joseph curwen was virtually an outcast suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named understood or even proved to exist the last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758 for in march and april of that year two royal regiments on their way to new france were quartered in providence and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion rumour dwelt on the frequency with which curwen was wont to be seen talking with the redcoated strangers and as several of them began to be missed people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen what would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on no one can tellmeanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering he had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre black pepper and cinnamon and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the browns in his importation of brassware indigo cotton woollens salt rigging iron paper and english goods of every kind such shopkeepers as james green at the sign of the elephant in cheapside the russells at the sign of the golden eagle across the bridge or clark and nightingale at the fryingpan and fish near the new coffeehouse depended almost wholly upon him for their stock and his arrangements with the local distillers the narragansett dairymen and horsebreeders and the newport candlemakers made him one of the prime exporters of the colonyostracised though he was he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort when the colony house burned down he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick onestill standing at the head of its parade in the old main streetwas built in 1761 in that same year too he helped rebuild the great bridge after the october gale he replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the colony house fire and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy market parade and deeprutted town street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or causey in the middle about this time also he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving when the whitefield adherents broke off from dr cottons hill church in 1743 and founded deacon snows church across the bridge curwen had gone with them though his zeal and attendance soon abated now however he cultivated piety once more as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked2the sight of this strange pallid man hardly middleaged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse was at once a pathetic a dramatic and a contemptible thing such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures however that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased he must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions for he was never again caught at such wanderings whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion his rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high but not until modern times when charles ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the shepley library did it occur to any personsave one embittered youth perhapsto make dark comparisons between the large number of guinea blacks he imported until 1766 and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slavedealers at the great bridge or to the planters of the narragansett country certainly the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon himbut of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer his elaborate studies and experiments whatever they may have been apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of providence so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation transparent excuses of errands elsewhere and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness his clerks being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ were giving him much worry and he held to his seacaptains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over thema mortgage a promissory note or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare in many cases diarists have recorded with some awe curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use during the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the longdead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues endabout this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community hitherto a complete hermit he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible it may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them but of this nothing certain can ever be learned naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure such candidates he found were not at all easy to discover since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty accomplishments and social security at length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest shipcaptains a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named dutee tillinghast whose only daughter eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress capt tillinghast was completely under the domination of curwen and consented after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on powers lane hill to sanction the blasphemous allianceeliza tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted she had attended stephen jacksons school opposite the courthouse parade and had been diligently instructed by her mother before the latters death of smallpox in 1757 in all the arts and refinements of domestic life a sampler of hers worked in 1753 at the age of nine may still be found in the rooms of the rhode island historical society after her mothers death she had kept the house aided only by one old black woman her arguments with her father concerning the proposed curwen marriage must have been painful indeed but of these we have no record certain it is that her engagement to young ezra weeden second mate of the crawford packetenterprisewas dutifully broken off and that her union with joseph curwen took place on the seventh of march 1763 in the baptist church in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast the ceremony being performed by the younger samuel winsor thegazettementioned the event very briefly and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the languagemonday evening last mr joseph curwen of this town merchant was married to miss eliza tillinghast daughter of capt dutee tillinghast a young lady who has real merit added to a beautiful person to grace the connubial state and perpetuate its felicitythe collection of durfeearnold letters discovered by charles ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of melville f peters esq of george st and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this illassorted match the social influence of the tillinghasts however was not to be denied and once more joseph curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold his acceptance was by no means complete and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down in his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration the new house in olney court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations and although curwen was much absent at the pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence only one person remained in open enmity with him this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to eliza tillinghast had been so abruptly broken ezra weeden had frankly vowed vengeance and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition was now gaining a hatebred dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husbandon the seventh of may 1765 curwens only child ann was born and was christened by the rev john graves of kings church of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage in order to compromise between their respective congregational and baptist affiliations the record of this birth as well as that of the marriage two years before was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear and charles ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness the birth entry indeed was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist dr graves who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the revolution ward had tried this source because he knew that his greatgreatgrandmother ann tillinghast potter had been an episcopalianshortly after the birth of his daughter an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness curwen resolved to sit for a portrait this he had painted by a very gifted scotsman named cosmo alexander then a resident of newport and since famous as the early teacher of gilbert stuart the likeness was said to have been executed on a wallpanel of the library of the house in olney court but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition at this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the pawtuxet road he seemed it was stated in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subjecthis affectation of civic interest did not diminish and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as stephen hopkins joseph brown and benjamin west in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town which was then much below the level of newport in its patronage of the liberal arts he had helped daniel jenckes found his bookshop in 1763 and was thereafter his best customer extending aid likewise to the strugglinggazettethat appeared each wednesday at the sign of shakespears head in politics he ardently supported governor hopkins against the ward party whose prime strength was in newport and his really eloquent speech at hackers hall in 1765 against the setting off of north providence as a separate town with a proward vote in the general assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him but ezra weeden who watched him closely sneered cynically at all this outward activity and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of tartarus the revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the curwen warehouses and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay he also kept as close a watch as possible on the pawtuxet farm and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old indian couple loosed upon him3in 1766 came the final change in joseph curwen it was very sudden and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak giving instant place to an illconcealed exaltation of perfect triumph curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing for no explanation was ever offered by him it was after this transition which appears to have come early in july that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their longdead ancestors would seem to be able to impartbut curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change on the contrary they tended rather to increase so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been he altogether abandoned the slave trade alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing every possible moment was spent at the pawtuxet farm though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which though not actually near graveyards were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was ezra weeden though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked and subjected curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had beforemany of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the sugar act which hampered a prominent traffick smuggling and evasion were the rule in narragansett bay and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces but weeden night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the curwen warehouses at the town street docks soon felt assured that it was not merely his majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of pawtuxet being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the curwen farm where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows after that change however the whole programme was altered importation of slaves ceased at once and for a time curwen abandoned his midnight sailings then about the spring of 1767 a new policy appeared once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black silent docks and this time they would go down the bay some distance perhaps as far as namquit point where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore and transport it overland to the farm locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes the cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffinsweeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity visiting it each night for long periods and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprintrevealing snow even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties he hired a tavern companion named eleazar smith to continue the survey during his absences and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours that they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible instead they wished to learn something definite before taking any action what they did learn must have been startling indeed and charles ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at weedens later burning of his notebooks all that can be told of their discoveries is what eleazar smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary and what other diarists and letterwriters have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally madeand according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehensionit is gathered that weeden and smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old indian and his wife underlay the farm the house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamondpaned lattice windows the laboratory being in a leanto toward the north where the roof came nearly to the ground this building stood clear of any other yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath these voices before 1766 were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams coupled with curious chants or invocations after that date however they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest they appeared to be in different languages all known to curwen whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply reproof or threatening sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house curwen certain captives and the guards of those captives there were voices of a sort that neither weeden nor smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality the nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism as if curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisonersweeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook for english french and spanish which he knew were frequently used but of these nothing has survived he did however say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of providence families were concerned most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages once for example an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in french about the black princes massacre at limoges in 1370 as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know curwen asked the prisonerif prisoner it werewhether the order to slay was given because of the sign of the goat found on the altar in the ancient roman crypt beneath the cathedral or whether the dark man of the haute vienne coven had spoken the three words failing to obtain replies the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping soundnone of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed since the windows were always heavily draped once though during a discourse in an unknown tongue a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled weeden exceedingly reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in hackers hall when a man from germantown pennsylvania had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a view of the famous city of jerusalem in which are represented jerusalem the temple of solomon his royal throne the noted towers and hills likewise the sufferings of our saviour from the garden of gethsemane to the cross on the hill of golgotha an artful piece of statuary worthy to be seen by the curious it was on this occasion that the listener who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded gave a start which roused the old indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him after that no more conversations were ever heard in the house and weeden and smith concluded that curwen had transferred his field of action to regions belowthat such regions in truth existed seemed amply clear from many things faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure whilst hidden in the bushes along the riverbank in the rear where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the pawtuxet there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill when or how these catacombs could have been constructed weeden was unable to say but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river joseph curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed during the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep riverbank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm and in a locality where old indian buryinggrounds were common but weeden and smith drew their own inferencesit was in january 1770 whilst weeden and smith were still debating vainly on what if anything to think or do about the whole bewildering business that the incident of thefortalezaoccurred exasperated by the burning of the revenue slooplibertyat newport during the previous summer the customs fleet under admiral wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels and on this occasion his majestys armed schoonercygnetunder capt charles leslie captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snowfortalezaof barcelona spain under capt manuel arruda bound according to its log from grand cairo egypt to providence when searched for contraband material this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of egyptian mummies consigned to sailor a b c who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off namquit point and whose identity capt arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal the viceadmiralty court at newport at a loss what to do in view of the noncontraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand compromised on collector robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in rhode island waters there were later rumours of its having been seen in boston harbour though it never openly entered the port of bostonthis extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in providence and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister joseph curwen his exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town as if conscious of this natural belief curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural yet stopping just short of admitting his participation weeden and smith of course felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing and indulged in the wildest theories concerning curwen and his monstrous laboursthe following spring like that of the year before had heavy rains and the watchers kept careful track of the riverbank behind the curwen farm large sections were washed away and a certain number of bones discovered but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows something was rumoured however at the village of pawtuxet about a mile below where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove there where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge and fishingsmacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls of course the pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards and of course the spring rains had been very heavy but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out that rumour sent smithfor weeden was just then at seain haste to the riverbank behind the farm where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cavein there was however no trace of a passage into the steep bank for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft smith went to the extent of some experimental digging but was deterred by lack of successor perhaps by fear of possible success it is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time4by the autumn of 1770 weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries for he had a large number of facts to link together and a second eyewitness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy as his first confidant he selected capt james mathewson of theenterprisewho on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect the colloquy took place in an upper room of sabins tavern near the docks with smith present to corroborate virtually every statement and it could be seen that capt mathewson was tremendously impressed like nearly everyone else in the town he had had black suspicions of his own anent joseph curwen hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely at the end of the conference he was very grave and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men he would he said transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of providence ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer secrecy would probably be essential in any case for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought curwen hitherthe right persons to tell he believed would be dr benjamin west whose pamphlet on the late transit of venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker rev james manning president of the college which had just moved up from warren and was temporarily housed in the new king street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above presbyterianlane exgovernor stephen hopkins who had been a member of the philosophical society at newport and was a man of very broad perceptions john carter publisher of thegazetteall four of the brown brothers john joseph nicholas and moses who formed the recognised local magnates and of whom joseph was an amateur scientist of parts old dr jabez bowen whose erudition was considerable and who had much firsthand knowledge of curwens odd purchases and capt abraham whipple a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed these men if favourable might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the governor of the colony joseph wanton of newport before taking actionthe mission of capt mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of weedens tale there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action curwen it was clear formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and colony and must be eliminated at any cost late in december 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of stephen hopkins and debated tentative measures weedens notes which he had given to capt mathewson were carefully read and he and smith were summoned to give testimony anent details something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over though there ran through that fear a grim determination which capt whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed they would not notify the governor because a more than legal course seemed necessary with hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town nameless reprisals might ensue and even if the sinister creature complied the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place the times were lawless and men who had flouted the kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled curwen must be surprised at his pawtuxet farm by a large raidingparty of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself if he proved a madman amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices he would be properly confined if something graver appeared and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real he and all with him must die it could be done quietly and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came aboutwhile these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around in the middle of a moonlight january night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window and people around weybosset point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the turks head there was a baying of dogs in the distance but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening but nothing rewarded their search the next morning however a giant muscular body stark naked was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the great bridge where the long dock stretched out beside abbotts distilhouse and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering it was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horrorbulging eyes strike any chord of memory they shaking as they did so exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear for in those stiff hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identityand that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years beforeezra weeden was present at the finding and remembering the baying of the night before set out along weybosset street and across muddy dock bridge whence the sound had come he had a curious expectancy and was not surprised when reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the pawtuxet road he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow the naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced they had given up the chase upon coming too near the town weeden smiled grimly and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source it was the pawtuxet farm of joseph curwen as he well knew it would be and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled as it was he dared not seem too interested in full daylight dr bowen to whom weeden went at once with his report performed an autopsy on the strange corpse and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly the digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use whilst the whole skin had a coarse loosely knit texture impossible to account for impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the longdead blacksmith daniel green whose greatgrandson aaron hoppin was a supercargo in curwens employ weeden asked casual questions till he found where green was buried that night a party of ten visited the old north burying ground opposite herrendens lane and opened a grave they found it vacant precisely as they had expectedmeanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept joseph curwens mail and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one jedediah orne of salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply parts of it copied and preserved in the private archives of the smith family where charles ward found it ran as followsi delight that you continue

unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet in the smith diary found by charles ward a single oftrepeated combination of characters is clumsily copied and authorities at brown university have pronounced the alphabet amharic or abyssinian although they do not recognise the word none of these epistles was ever delivered to curwen though the disappearance of jedediah orne from salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the providence men took certain quiet steps the pennsylvania historical society also has some curious letters received by dr shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in philadelphia but more decisive steps were in the air and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of weedens disclosures slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of joseph curwens noxious mysteriescurwen despite all precautions apparently felt that something was in the wind for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look his coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the pawtuxet road and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice the nearest neighbours to his farm the fenners one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high excessively narrow windows an event which they quickly communicated to john brown in providence mr brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on curwens extirpation and had informed the fenners that some action was about to be taken this he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid and he explained his course by saying that curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at newport against whom the hand of every providence shipper merchant and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain but at any rate the fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways to them mr brown had entrusted the duty of watching the curwen farmhouse and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there5the probability that curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things as suggested by the odd shaft of light precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens according to the smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 pm on friday april 12th 1771 in the great room of thurstons tavern at the sign of the golden lion on weybosset point across the bridge of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader john brown there were present dr bowen with his case of surgical instruments president manning without the great periwig the largest in the colonies for which he was noted governor hopkins wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother esek whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest john carter capt mathewson and capt whipple who was to lead the actual raiding party these chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber after which capt whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions eleazar smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of ezra weeden whose duty was to keep track of curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farmabout 1030 a heavy rumble was heard on the great bridge followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside and at that hour there was no need of waiting for weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry a moment later as the receding coach clattered faintly over the muddy dock bridge weeden appeared and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street shouldering the firelocks fowlingpieces or whaling harpoons which they had with them weeden and smith were with the party and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service capt whipple the leader capt esek hopkins john carter president manning capt mathewson and dr bowen together with moses brown who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern all these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the muddy dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of broad street toward the pawtuxet road just beyond elder snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at providence lying outspread under the early spring stars steeples and gables rose dark and shapely and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the bridge vega was climbing above the great hill across the water whose crest of trees was broken by the roofline of the unfinished college edifice at the foot of that hill and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side the old town dreamed old providence for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped outan hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived as previously agreed at the fenner farmhouse where they heard a final report on their intended victim he had reached his farm over half an hour before and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky but there were no lights in any visible windows this was always the case of late even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders capt whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions one of twenty men under eleazar smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landingplace against possible reinforcements for curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service a second of twenty men under capt esek hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high steep bank and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves of this division one third was to be led by capt mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows another third to follow capt whipple himself to the main farmhouse and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signalthe river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistleblast then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within at the sound of two whistleblasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent the party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner forcing an entrance at the first and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns a third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building capt whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans he had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals the final reserve at the landing of course was nearly out of the whistles range hence would require a special messenger if needed for help moses brown and john carter went with capt hopkins to the riverbank while president manning was detailed with capt mathewson to the stone building dr bowen with ezra weeden remained in capt whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself the attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from capt hopkins had joined capt whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness the leader would then deliver the loud single blast and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points shortly before 1 am the three divisions left the fenner farmhouse one to guard the landing another to seek the river valley and the hillside door and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the curwen farmeleazar smith who accompanied the shoreguarding party records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots and still later smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air it was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been joseph curwen something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed for though he was a seaman well known to many of them there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart it was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable they had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures and could not forget it from them there was never any gossip for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries and from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them and eleazar smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the sign of the golden lion under the starscharles ward however discovered another vague sidelight in some fenner correspondence which he found in new london where he knew another branch of the family had lived it seems that the fenners from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible had watched the departing columns of raiders and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the curwen dogs followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack this blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building and in another moment after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent luke fenner had represented in his epistle by the characterswaaaahrrrrrrwaaahrrrthis cry however had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound it was later repeated less loudly and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river about an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece a strong smell of sulphur was noted and luke fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal though the others failed to detect it muffled musketry sounded again followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it a kind of throaty nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic valuethen the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the curwen farm ought to lie and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard muskets flashed and cracked and the flaming thing fell to the ground a second flaming thing appeared and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy almighty protect thy lamb then there were more shots and the second flaming thing fell after that came silence for about threequarters of an hour at the end of which time little arthur fenner lukes brother exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance no one but the child can testify to this but luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the roomfive minutes later a chill wind blew up and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in pawtuxet village this stench was nothing which any of the fenners had ever encountered before and produced a kind of clutching amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnelhouse close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget it thundered out of the sky like a doom and windows rattled as its echoes died away it was deep and musical powerful as a bass organ but evil as the forbidden books of the arabs what it said no man can tell for it spoke in an unknown tongue but this is the writing luke fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations deesmeesjeshetbone dosefe duvemaenitemoss not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge but charles ward paled as he recognised what mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantationsan unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the curwen farm after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable a wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms at times it became almost articulate though no auditor could trace any definite words and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter then a yell of utter ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throatsa yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst after which darkness and silence ruled all things spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following daytoward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the fenner door and requested a keg of rum for which they paid very well indeed one of them told the family that the affair of joseph curwen was over and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again arrogant as the order seemed the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority so that only these furtive letters of luke fenner which he urged his connecticut relative to destroy remain to tell what was seen and heard the noncompliance of that relative whereby the letters were saved after all has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion charles ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions old charles slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of joseph curwen was announced what kept the talk alive was the notion that this body so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about6not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party there is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter eight sailors had been killed but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred the same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by dr jabez bowen who had accompanied the party hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders a thing which was discussed for weeks of the citizen leaders capt whipple and moses brown were most severely hurt and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced psychologically every participant was aged sobered and shaken it is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple orthodox religionists for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed president manning was the most disturbed but even he outgrew the darkest shadow and smothered memories in prayers every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so little more than a twelvemonth afterward capt whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue shipgaspeeand in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome imagesthere was delivered to the widow of joseph curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design obviously found ready on the spot when needed in which she was told her husbands body lay he had it was explained been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details more than this no tongue ever uttered of joseph curwens end and charles ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory this hint was the merest threada shaky underscoring of a passage in jedediah ornes confiscated letter to curwen as partly copied in ezra weedens handwriting the copy was found in the possession of smiths descendants and we are left to decide whether weeden gave it to his companion after the end as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred or whether as is more probable smith had it before and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit crossquestioning the underlined passage is merely thisi say to you againe doe not call up any that you can not put downe by the which i meane any that can in turne call up somewhat against you whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use ask of the lesser lest the greater shall not wish to answer and shall commande more than youin the light of this passage and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity charles ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of providence killed joseph curwenthe deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders they had not at first meant to be so thorough and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions but capt tillinghast was an astute man and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name burn the library and all remaining papers and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above joseph curwens grave he knew capt whipple well and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcererfrom that time on the obliteration of curwens memory became increasingly rigid extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of thegazetteit can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on oscar wildes name for a decade after his disgrace and in extent only to the fate of that sinful king of runazar in lord dunsanys tale whom the gods decided must not only cease to be but must cease ever to have beenmrs tillinghast as the widow became known after 1772 sold the house in olney court and resided with her father in powers lane till her death in 1817 the farm at pawtuxet shunned by every living soul remained to moulder through the years and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity by 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps none ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the riverbank behind which the hillside door may have lain nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which joseph curwen departed from the horrors he had wroughtonly robust old capt whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself pox on that but he had no business to laugh while he screamed twas as though the damnd had someat up his sleeve for half a crown id burn his houseiii a search and an evocation1charles ward as we have seen first learned in 1918 of his descent from joseph curwen that he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at for every vague rumour that he had heard of curwen now became something vital to himself in whom flowed curwens blood no spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of curwen datain his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy so that even dr lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919 he talked freely with his familythough his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like curwenand with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited in applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letterwriters were regarded he often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find and what joseph curwen really had beenwhen he came across the smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from jedediah orne he decided to visit salem and look up curwens early activities and connexions there which he did during the easter vacation of 1919 at the essex institute which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs he was very kindly received and unearthed there a considerable amount of curwen data he found that his ancestor was born in salemvillage now danvers seven miles from town on the eighteenth of february os 16623 and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen not appearing again for nine years when he returned with the speech dress and manners of a native englishman and settled in salem proper at that time he had little to do with his family but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from europe and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from england france and holland certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at nightcurwens only close friends had been one edward hutchinson of salemvillage and one simon orne of salem with these men he was often seen in conference about the common and visits among them were by no means infrequent hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night he was said to entertain strange visitors and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour the knowledge he displayed concerning longdead persons and longforgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began never to be heard from again at that time joseph curwen also departed but his settlement in providence was soon learned of simon orne lived in salem until 1720 when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention he thereafter disappeared though thirty years later his precise counterpart and selfstyled son turned up to claim his property the claim was allowed on the strength of documents in simon ornes known hand and jedediah orne continued to dwell in salem till 1771 when certain letters from providence citizens to the rev thomas barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknowncertain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the essex institute the court house and the registry of deeds and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature there were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records as when one hepzibah lawson swore on july 10 1692 at the court of oyer and terminer under judge hathorne that fortie witches and the blacke man were wont to meete in the woodes behind mr hutchinsons house and one amity how declared at a session of august 8th before judge gedney that mr g b rev george burroughs on that nighte putt yedivell his marke upon bridget s jonathan asimon odeliverance wjoseph csusan p mehitable c and deborah b then there was a catalogue of hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting couched in a cipher none could read ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him after the following august his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before october or november he never stated though whether or not he had succeededbut of the greatest immediate interest was the orne material it took ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to curwen namely that simon orne and his supposed son were one and the same person as orne had said to his correspondent it was hardly safe to live too long in salem hence he resorted to a thirtyyear sojourn abroad and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder there were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which ward now either copied with care or had photographed and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the registry of deeds as positively joseph curwensthis curwen letter though undated as to the year was evidently not the one in answer to which orne had written the confiscated missive and from internal evidence ward placed it not much later than 1750 it may not be amiss to give the text in full as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible the recipient is addressed as simon but a line whether drawn by curwen or orne ward could not tell is run through the wordprouidence i may ut vulgobrothermy honourd antient

letter oddly enough was what first gave ward the exact location of curwens providence home for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific the discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old a dilapidated building still standing in olney court and well known to ward in his antiquarian rambles over stampers hill the place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing housecleaning and furnacetending services to find in distant salem such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history was a highly impressive thing to ward and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return the more mystical phases of the letter which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism frankly baffled him though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the biblical passage referred tojob 14 14was the familiar verse if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come2young ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement and spent the following saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in olney court the place now crumbling with age had never been a mansion but was a modest twoandahalf story wooden town house of the familiar providence colonial type with plain peaked roof large central chimney and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight triangular pediment and trim doric pilasters it had suffered but little alteration externally and ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his questthe present negro inhabitants were known to him and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old asa and his stout wife hannah here there was more change than the outside indicated and ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scrollandurn overmantels and shellcarved cupboard linings were gone whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked hacked and gouged or covered up altogether with cheap wallpaper in general the survey did not yield as much as ward had somehow expected but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as joseph curwen he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knockerfrom then until after the close of school ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local curwen data the former still proved unyielding but of the latter he obtained so much and so many clues to similar data elsewhere that he was ready by july to make a trip to new london and new york to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated this trip was very fruitful for it brought him the fenner letters with their terrible description of the pawtuxet farmhouse raid and the nightingaletalbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the curwen library this matter of the portrait interested him particularly since he would have given much to know just what joseph curwen looked like and he decided to make a second search of the house in olney court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wallpaperearly in august that search took place and ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder he paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained and was keenly excited after about an hour when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious groundfloor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been a few more careful tests with a thin knife and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent with truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help in three days he returned with an artist of long experience mr walter c dwight whose studio is near the foot of college hill and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances old asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearthas day by day the work of restoration progressed charles ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion dwight had begun at the bottom hence since the picture was a threequarterlength one the face did not come out for some time it was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare wellshaped man with darkblue coat embroidered waistcoat black satin smallclothes and white silk stockings seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond when the head came out it was observed to bear a neat albemarle wig and to possess a thin calm undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both ward and the artist only at the very last though did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean pallid visage and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played for it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden and to confront the bewildered charles dexter ward dweller in the past with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible greatgreatgreatgrandfatherward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling the resemblance to the boy despite an appearance of rather greater age was marvellous and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of joseph curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half mrs wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone curwen she did not relish the discovery and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home there was she averred something unwholesome about it not only intrinsically but in its very resemblance to charles mr ward however was a practical man of power and affairsa cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at riverpoint in the pawtuxet valleyand not one to listen to feminine scruples the picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son and he believed the boy deserved it as a present in this opinion it is needless to say charles most heartily concurred and a few days later mr ward located the owner of the housea small rodentfeatured person with a guttural accentand obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous hagglingit now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the ward home where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mockfireplace in charless thirdfloor study or library to charles was left the task of superintending this removal and on the twentyeighth of august he accompanied two expert workmen from the crooker decorating firm to the house in olney court where the mantel and portraitbearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck there was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course and in this young ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait curious as to what such a space might mean or contain the youth approached and looked within finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers a crude thick copybook and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover it was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the essex institute and proclaimed the volume as thejournall and notes of jos curwen gent of providenceplantations late of salemexcited beyond measure by his discovery ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding and dr willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities all the other papers were likewise in curwens handwriting and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscriptionto him who shal come after how he may gett beyonde time yespheresanother was in a cipher the same ward hoped as the hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him a third and here the searcher rejoiced seemed to be a key to the cipher whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to edw hutchinson armiger and jedediah orne esq or their heir or heirs or those representg them the sixth and last was inscribedjoseph curwen his life and travells betn yeyeares 1678 and 1687 of whither he voyagd where he stayd whom he sawe and what he learnt3we have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date charles wards madness upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously indeed in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself he did not even shew the titles to his parents but simply told them that he had found some documents in joseph curwens handwriting mostly in cipher which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning it is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity as it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matterthat night charles ward sat up in his room reading the newfound book and papers and when day came he did not desist his meals on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss were sent up to him and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study the next night he slept in snatches in his clothes meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript in the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher which he had frequently shewn her before but in response to her query he said that the curwen key could not be applied to it that afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log setting the mockfireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms the front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it after the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a yearadding and centuryrecalling mirrorhis parents subsequently recalling his conduct at this period give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying since he rightly assumed that curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them with his parents however he was more circumspect and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs as that entitledto him who shal come afteretc seemed to be he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed at night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his where he also placed them whenever he left the room he soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease the opening of school where he now began his senior year seemed a great bore to him and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college he had he said important special investigations to make which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boastnaturally only one who had always been more or less studious eccentric and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice ward however was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted at the same time both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasuretrove nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered this reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all curwen delvingsduring october ward began visiting the libraries again but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days witchcraft and magic occultism and daemonology were what he sought now and when providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for boston and tap the wealth of the great library in copley square the widener library at harvard or the zion research library in brookline where certain rare works on biblical subjects are available he bought extensively and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects while during the christmas holidays he made a round of outoftown trips including one to salem to consult certain records at the essex instituteabout the middle of january 1920 there entered wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain and he was no more found at work upon the hutchinson cipher instead he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and recordscanning fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in providence local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies later questioned gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased but clerks at the state house the city hall and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest he was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of joseph curwen from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the namelittle by little there grew upon the ward family the conviction that something was wrong charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him his school work was the merest pretence and although he failed in no test it could be seen that the old application had all vanished he had other concernments now and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study where the startlinglyone almost fancied increasinglysimilar features of joseph curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north walllate in march ward added to his archivesearching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city the cause appeared later when it was learned from city hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue his quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of joseph curwen to that of one naphthali field and this shift was explained when upon going over the files that he had been over the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred 10 ft s and 5 ft w of naphthali fields grave in ye the lack of a specified buryingground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search and naphthali fields grave seemed as elusive as that of curwen but here no systematic effacement had existed and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished hence the ramblesfrom which st johns the former kings churchyard and the ancient congregational buryingground in the midst of swan point cemetery were excluded since other statistics had shewn that the only naphthali field obiit 1729 whose grave could have been meant had been a baptist4it was toward may when dr willett at the request of the senior ward and fortified with all the curwen data which the family had gleaned from charles in his nonsecretive days talked with the young man the interview was of little value or conclusiveness for willett felt at every moment that charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour of a pallid impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits though not to reveal their object he stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge for the most part in cipher of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of friar bacon and perhaps surpassing even those they were however meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance to take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved and to this task of correlation ward was now devoting himself he was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the curwen data must possess and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought not even einstein he declared could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of thingsas to his graveyard search whose object he freely admitted but the details of whose progress he did not relate he said he had reason to think that joseph curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbolscarved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the namewhich were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system curwen he believed had wished to guard his secret with care and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion when dr willett asked to see the mystic documents ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the hutchinson cipher and orne formulae and diagrams but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real curwen findsthejournall and notesthe cipher title in cipher also and the formulafilled messageto him who shal come afterand let him glance inside such as were in obscure charactershe also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave willett a glimpse of curwens connected handwriting in english the doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century and became quickly certain that the document was genuine the text itself was relatively trivial and

reaching this point dr willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by ward who almost snatched the book from his grasp all that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief

entertained the odd fancywhich his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancythat the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish if not an actual tendency to follow young charles ward as he moved about the room he stopped before leaving to study the picture closely marvelling at its resemblance to charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical colourless face even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye cosmo alexander he decided was a painter worthy of the scotland that produced raeburn and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil gilbert stuartassured by the doctor that charless mental health was in no danger but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance the wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following june the youth made positive his refusal to attend college he had he declared studies of much more vital importance to pursue and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in america the senior ward while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen acquiesced regarding the university so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the moses brown school there ensued for charles a threeyear period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching he became recognised as an eccentric and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article again he sought a small village in the adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come but still his parents forbade him the trip to the old world which he desiredcoming of age in april 1923 and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather ward determined at last to take the european trip hitherto denied him of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully when they saw he could not be dissuaded they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could so that in june the young man sailed for liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother who accompanied him to boston and waved him out of sight from the white star pier in charlestown letters soon told of his safe arrival and of his securing good quarters in great russell street london where he proposed to stay shunning all family friends till he had exhausted the resources of the british museum in a certain direction of his daily life he wrote but little for there was little to write study and experiment consumed all his time and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms that he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mindin june 1924 a brief note told of his departure for paris to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the bibliothque nationale for three months thereafter he sent only postal cards giving an address in the rue st jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector he avoided acquaintances and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him then came a silence and in october the wards received a picture card from prague czechoslovakia stating that charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information he gave an address in the neustadt and announced no move till the following january when he dropped several cards from vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellowdelvers into the occult had invited himthe next card was from klausenburg in transylvania and told of wards progress toward his destination he was going to visit a baron ferenczy whose estate lay in the mountains east of rakus and was to be addressed at rakus in the care of that nobleman another card from rakus a week later saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains was his last message for a considerable time indeed he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until may when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in london paris or rome during the summer when the elder wards were planning to travel in europe his researches he said were such that he could not leave his present quarters while the situation of baron ferenczys castle did not favour visits it was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease moreover the baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative new england gentlefolk his aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies and his age was so great as to be disquieting it would be better charles said if his parents would wait for his return to providence which could scarcely be far distantthat return did not however take place until may 1926 when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into new york on thehomericand traversed the long miles to providence by motorcoach eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills the fragrant blossoming orchards and the white steepled towns of vernal connecticut his first taste of ancient new england in nearly four years when the coach crossed the pawcatuck and entered rhode island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force and the entry to providence along reservoir and elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved at the high square where broad weybosset and empire streets join he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind the biltmore bringing into view the great dome and soft roofpierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river and the tall colonial spire of the first baptist church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous backgroundold providence it was this place and the mysterious forces of its long continuous history which had brought him into being and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix here lay the arcana wondrous or dreadful as the case might be for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him a taxicab whirled him through post office square with its glimpse of the river the old market house and the head of the bay and up the steep curved slope of waterman street to prospect where the vast gleaming dome and sunsetflushed ionic columns of the christian science church beckoned northward then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet and at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right on the left the classic adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born it was twilight and charles dexter ward had come home5a school of alienists slightly less academic than dr lymans assign to wards european trip the beginning of his true madness admitting that he was sane when he started they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change but even to this claim dr willett refuses to accede there was he insists something later and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroadodd enough things to be sure but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant ward himself though visibly aged and hardened was still normal in his general reactions and in several talks with willett displayed a balance which no madmaneven an incipient onecould feign continuously for long what elicited the notion of insanity at this period were thesoundsheard at all hours from wards attic laboratory in which he kept himself most of the time there were chantings and repetitions and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms and although these sounds were always in wards own voice there was something in the quality of that voice and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced which could not but chill the blood of every hearer it was noticed that nig the venerable and beloved black cat of the household bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heardthe odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange sometimes they were very noxious but more often they were aromatic with a haunting elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images people who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance ward did not resume his oldtime rambles but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home and to equally strange delvings within his quarters explaining that european sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work and promising great revelations in the years to come his older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the curwen portrait in his library and dr willett would often pause by the latter after a call marvelling at the virtual identity and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the longdead wizard from the living youth these calls of willetts undertaken at the request of the senior wards were curious affairs ward at no time repulsed the doctor but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology frequently he noted peculiar things about little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables and the halferased remnants of circles triangles and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room and always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of charless madnessin january 1927 a peculiar incident occurred one night about midnight as charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay and a faint obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted at the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around this was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm anomalous for the season which brought with it such a crash that mr and mrs ward believed the house had been struck they rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done but charles met them at the door to the attic pale resolute and portentous with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face he assured them that the house had not really been struck and that the storm would soon be over they paused and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right for the lightning flashed farther and farther off whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water the thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away stars came out and the stamp of triumph on charles wards face crystallised into a very singular expressionfor two months or more after this incident ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory he exhibited a curious interest in the weather and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground one night late in march he left the house after midnight and did not return till almost morning when his mother being wakeful heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance muffled oaths could be distinguished and mrs ward rising and going to the window saw four dark figures removing a long heavy box from a truck at charless direction and carrying it within by the side door she heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs and finally a dull thumping in the attic after which the footfalls descended again and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truckthe next day charles resumed his strict attic seclusion drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance he would open the door to no one and steadfastly refused all proffered food about noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard but when mrs ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly and told her that nothing had gone amiss the hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary solitude was the one prime essential and he would appear later for dinner that afternoon after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal he did finally appear wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext this indeed proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out furnished roughly and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment here he lived with books brought up from his library beneath till the time he purchased the pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effectsin the evening charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident later on dr willett having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household looked up an intact copy at thejournaloffice and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurrednocturnal diggers surprised innorth burial groundrobert hart night watchman at the north burial ground this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have beenthe discovery took place at about four oclock when harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter investigating he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach the men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken and since no known grave was disturbed hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to burythe diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection for hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of amasa field where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared the hole a place as large and deep as a grave was empty and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery recordssergt riley of the second station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed in reply to questions hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up rochambeau avenue though he could not be sureduring the next few days ward was seldom seen by his family having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm he kept closely to himself there ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away the droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass hissing chemicals running water or roaring gas flames odours of the most unplaceable quality wholly unlike any before noted hung at times around the door and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation once he made a hasty trip to the athenaeum for a book he required and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from boston suspense was written portentously over the whole situation and both the family and dr willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it6then on the fifteenth of april a strange development occurred while nothing appeared to grow different in kind there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree and dr willett somehow attaches great significance to the change the day was good friday a circumstance of which the servants made much but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence late in the afternoon young ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house the formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that mrs ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously and later on she was able to write it down at dr willetts request it ran as follows and experts have told dr willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of eliphas levi that cryptic

the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in the extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day but to those in the ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it a hideous allpervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since in the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around and then was heardthe voicethat no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness its incredible depth and its eldritch dissimilarity to charles wards voice it shook the house and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs mrs ward who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory shivered as she recognised its hellish import for charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books and of the manner in which it had thundered according to the fenner letters above the doomed pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of joseph curwens annihilation there was no mistaking that nightmare phrase for charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his curwen investigations and yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language dies mies jeschet boene doesef douvema enitemausclose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight though sunset was still an hour distant and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like yinashyogsothothhelgebfithrodogending in a yah whose maniacal force mounted in an earsplitting crescendo a second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter mrs ward with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels but obtained no sign of recognition she knocked again but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her sonand sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voicepresently she fainted although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause memory sometimes makes merciful deletionsmr ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six and not finding his wife downstairs was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at charless door from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before mounting the stairs at once he saw mrs ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory and realising that she had fainted hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove dashing the cold fluid in her face he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging for the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be but held the murmurs of a tense muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soulit was not of course new for charles to mutter formulae but this muttering was definitely different it was so palpably a dialogue or imitation of a dialogue with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer statement and response one voice was undisguisedly that of charles but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before there was something hideous blasphemous and abnormal about it and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that theodore howland ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted as it was he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him even so however he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden for mrs wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded they were merely an excited caution in charless own voice but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them the phrase was just thissshhwritemr and mrs ward conferred at some length after dinner and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with charles that very night no matter how important the object such conduct could no longer be permitted for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous wellbeing of the entire household the youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth all this must be stopped or mrs ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibilitymr ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for charless laboratory on the third floor however he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled and upon stepping to the door mr ward beheld the youth within excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape charless aspect was very drawn and haggard and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice at the elder mans command he sat down and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved there was no scene at the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right and that his noises mutterings incantations and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances he agreed to a policy of greater quiet though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy much of his future work he said was in any case purely book research and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage for the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere his use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered mr ward but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity the interview was really quite inconclusive and as charles picked up his armful and left the room mr ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business it was as mysterious as the death of poor old nig whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement with staring eyes and feardistorted mouthdriven by some vague detective instinct the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic the youths library was plainly and rigidly classified so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn on this occasion mr ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian beyond what had been previously removed was missing these new withdrawals were all modern items histories scientific treatises geographies manuals of literature philosophic works and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines it was a very curious shift from charles wards recent run of reading and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness the strangeness was a very poignant sensation and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him something was indeed wrong and tangibly as well as spiritually so ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss and at last it dawned upon him what it wason the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in olney court but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large curwen portrait disaster had come time and unequal heating had done their work at last and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened peeling clear of the wood curling tighter and tighter and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness the portrait of joseph curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluishgrey dustiv a mutation and a madness1in the week following that memorable good friday charles ward was seen more often than usual and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory his actions were quiet and rational but he had a furtive hunted look which his mother did not like and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook dr willett had been told of those friday noises and happenings and on the following tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more the interview was as always inconclusive but willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time he held out promises of an early revelation and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere at the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumblingabout the second week charles began to be absent from the house for long periods and one day when good old black hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in olney court where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar he was always very liberal to her and to old asa but seemed more worried than he used to be which grieved her very much since she had watched him grow up from birth another report of his doings came from pawtuxet where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times he seemed to haunt the resort and canoehouse of rhodesonthepawtuxet and subsequent inquiries by dr willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedgedin riverbank along which he would walk toward the north usually not reappearing for a very long whilelate in may came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from mr ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from charles it occurred one morning and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent good friday the youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused mrs ward to run upstairs and listen at the door she could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were must have it red for three months and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once when charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid but which he would try to transfer to other realmsabout the middle of june a queer nocturnal incident occurred in the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs and mr ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down that midnight after the family had retired the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress the youth spoke no word but the worthy yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly he opened the door and young ward went out but in the morning he presented his resignation to mrs ward there was he said something unholy in the glance charles had fixed on him it was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person and he could not possibly stay another night mrs ward allowed the man to depart but she did not value his statement highly to fancy charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above sounds as if of sobbing and pacing and of a sighing which told only of despairs profoundest depths mrs ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mindthe next evening much as on another evening nearly three months before charles ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section the matter was not recalled till later when dr willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there in thejournaloffice he found the section which charles had lost and marked two items as of possible significance they were as followsmore cemetery delvingit was this morning discovered by robert hart night watchman at the north burial ground that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery the grave of ezra weeden who was born in 1740 and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone was found excavated and rifled the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent toolshedwhatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood there were no wheel tracks but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity and which indicate the boots of a man of refinementhart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last march when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation but sergt riley of the second station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases in march the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known but this time a wellmarked and caredfor grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day beforemembers of the weeden family notified of the happening expressed their astonishment and regret and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor hazard weeden of 598 angell street recalls a family legend according to which ezra weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances not dishonourable to himself shortly before the revolution but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant inspector cunningham has been assigned to the case and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near futuredogs noisy in pawtuxetresidents of pawtuxet were aroused about 3 am today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of rhodesonthepawtuxet the volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd according to most who heard it and fred lemdin night watchman at rhodes declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony a sharp and very brief thunderstorm which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river put an end to the disturbance strange and unpleasant odours probably from the oil tanks along the bay are popularly linked with this incident and may have had their share in exciting the dogsthe aspect of charles now became very haggard and hunted and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him the morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator these cases too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities the residential hill and the north end near the ward home and the suburban districts across the cranston line near pawtuxet both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean lithe leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenouslydr willett who refuses to date the madness of charles ward as far back as even this is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors he has he declares certain theories of his own and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation i will not he says state who or what i believe perpetrated these attacks and murders but i will declare that charles ward was innocent of them i have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument ward meddled with terrible things but he has paid for it and he was never a monster or a villain as for nowi dont like to think a change came and im content to believe that the old charles ward died with it his soul did anyhow for that mad flesh that vanished from waites hospital had anotherwillett speaks with authority for he was often at the ward home attending mrs ward whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy and which he ridiculed in talking to her although they made him ponder deeply when alone these delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times early in july willett ordered mrs ward to atlantic city for an indefinite recuperative sojourn and cautioned both mr ward and the haggard and elusive charles to write her only cheering letters it is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity2not long after his mothers departure charles ward began negotiating for the pawtuxet bungalow it was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above rhodes but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else he gave the realestate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study he had this van loaded in the black small hours and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away after that charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor and never haunted the attic againto the pawtuxet bungalow charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries a villainouslooking portuguese halfcaste from the south main st waterfront who acted as a servant and a thin scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation the mulatto gomes spoke very little english and the bearded man who gave his name as dr allen voluntarily followed his example ward himself tried to be more affable but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the allnight burning of lights and somewhat later after this burning had suddenly ceased there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butchers and of the muffled shouting declamation rhythmic chanting and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of edgewoodward spent most of his time at the bungalow but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his fathers roof twice he was absent from the city on weeklong trips whose destinations have not yet been discovered he grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to dr willett his old old story of vital research and future revelations willett often waylaid him at his fathers house for the elder ward was deeply worried and perplexed and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult the doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this and adduces many a conversation to prove his pointabout september the vampirism declined but in the following january ward almost became involved in serious trouble for some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents in a lonely spot near hope valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by hijackers in quest of liquor shipments but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock for the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things so gruesome in fact that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld the thieves had hastily buried what they discovered but when the state police got wind of the matter a careful search was made a recently arrested vagrant under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing it would not be well for the nationalor even the internationalsense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party there was no mistaking it even by these far from studious officers and telegrams to washington ensued with feverish rapiditythe cases were addressed to charles ward at his pawtuxet bungalow and state and federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call they found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence he had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be of theidentityof the specimens he had known absolutely nothing and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce in this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague dr allen whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones so that in the end the officials took no action but carefully set down the new york name and address which ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing it is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbanceon february 9 1928 dr willett received a letter from charles ward which he considers of extraordinary importance and about which he has frequently quarrelled with dr lyman lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a welldeveloped case ofdementia praecoxbut willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth he calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship which though shewing traces of shattered nerves is nevertheless distinctly wards own the text in full is as follows100 prospect stprovidence rifebruary 8 1928dear dr willetti feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which i have so long promised you and for which you have pressed me so often the patience you have shewn in waiting and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity are things i shall never cease to appreciateand now that i am ready to speak i must own with humiliation that no triumph such as i dreamed of can ever be mine instead of triumph i have found terror and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation you recall what those fenner letters said of the old raiding party at pawtuxet that must all be done again and quickly upon us depends more than can be put into wordsall civilisation all natural law perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe i have brought to light a monstrous abnormality but i did it for the sake of knowledge now for the sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark againi have left that pawtuxet place forever and we must extirpate everything existing there alive or dead i shall not go there again and you must not believe it if you ever hear that i am there i will tell you why i say this when i see you i have come home for good and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what i have to say it will take that longand believe me when i tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this my life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balancei dare not tell my father for he could not grasp the whole thing but i have told him of my danger and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house i dont know how much good they can do for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge so come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hellany time will doi shall not be out of the house dont telephone ahead for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you and let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meetingin utmost gravity and desperationcharles dexter wardps shoot dr allen on sightand dissolve his body in aciddont burn itdr willett received this note about 1030 am and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary he planned to arrive about four oclock and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger willett had seen too much of charles wards oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving that something very subtle ancient and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure and the reference to dr allen could almost be comprehended in view of what pawtuxet gossip said of wards enigmatical colleague willett had never seen the man but had heard much of his aspect and bearing and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those muchdiscussed dark glasses might concealpromptly at four dr willett presented himself at the ward residence but found to his annoyance that charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors the guards were there but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity he had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone one of the detectives said replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as i am very tired and must rest a while i cant receive anyone for some time youll have to excuse me please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise or i am very sorry but i must take a complete vacation from everything ill talk with you later then apparently gaining boldness through meditation he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one oclock and entered the house without a word he had gone upstairs where a bit of his fear must have surged back for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp when however the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued after which he had reappeared and left at once willett inquired whether or not any message had been left but was told that there was none the butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in charless appearance and manner and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nervesfor almost two hours dr willett waited vainly in charles wards library watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall whence a year before the suave features of old joseph curwen had looked mildly down after a time the shadows began to gather and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadowlike before the night mr ward finally arrived and shewed much surprise and anger at his sons absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him he had not known of charless appointment and promised to notify willett when the youth returned in bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his sons condition and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise willett was glad to escape from that library for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil he had never liked that picture and even now strongnerved though he was there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible3the next morning willett received a message from the senior ward saying that charles was still absent mr ward mentioned that dr allen had telephoned him to say that charles would remain at pawtuxet for some time and that he must not be disturbed this was necessary because allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period leaving the researches in need of charless constant oversight charles sent his best wishes and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused in listening to this message mr ward heard dr allens voice for the first time and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulnessfaced by these baffling and contradictory reports dr willett was frankly at a loss what to do the frantic earnestness of charless note was not to be denied yet what could one think of its writers immediate violation of his own expressed policy young ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost and that he himself would never return to their final scene yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside willett read it over again and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply its terror was too profound and real and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation there were nameless horrors abroad and no matter how little one might be able to get at them one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any timefor over a week dr willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him and became more and more inclined to pay charles a call at the pawtuxet bungalow no friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give but willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary mr ward had been receiving brief and noncommittal typed notes from his son and said that mrs ward in her atlantic city retirement had had no better word so at length the doctor resolved to act and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of joseph curwen and by more recent revelations and warnings from charles ward set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the riverwillett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence hence knew exactly the route to take driving out broad street one early afternoon toward the end of february in his small motor he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fiftyseven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehendthe ride through the citys decaying fringe was short and trim edgewood and sleepy pawtuxet presently spread out ahead willett turned to the right down lockwood street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond houses were still few here and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand and spoke without a tremor to the evil portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crackhe must he said see charles ward at once on vitally important business no excuse would be accepted and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder ward the mulatto still hesitated and pushed against the door when willett attempted to open it but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it let him in tony it said we may as well talk now as ever but disturbing as was the whisper the greater fear was that which immediately followed the floor creaked and the speaker hove in sightand the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than charles dexter wardthe minuteness with which dr willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period for at last he concedes a vital change in charles dexter wards mentality and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years controversy with dr lyman has compelled him to be very specific and he definitely dates the madness of charles ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents those notes are not in wards normal style not even in the style of that last frantic letter to willett instead they are strange and archaic as if the snapping of the writers mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism there is an obvious effort to be modern but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the pastthe past too was evident in wards every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow he bowed motioned willett to a seat and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outseti am grown phthisical he began from this cursed river air you must excuse my speech i suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me and i hope you will say nothing to alarm himwillett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care but studying even more closely the face of the speaker something he felt was wrong and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that yorkshire butler one night he wished it were not so dark but did not request that any blind be opened instead he merely asked ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week beforei was coming to that the host replied you must know i am in a very bad state of nerves and do and say queer things i cannot account for as i have told you often i am on the edge of great matters and the bigness of them has a way of making me lightheaded any man might well be frighted of what i have found but i am not to be put off for long i was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home for having gone this far my place is here i am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours and perhaps i was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me there is no evil to any in what i do so long as i do it rightly have the goodness to wait six months and ill shew you what will pay your patience wellyou may as well know i have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books and ill leave you to judge the importance of what i can give to history philosophy and the arts by reason of the doors i have access to my ancestor had all this when those witless peeping toms came and murdered him i now have it again or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it this time nothing must happen and least of all through any idiot fears of my own pray forget all i writ you sir and have no fear of this place or any in it dr allen is a man of fine parts and i owe him an apology for anything ill i have said of him i wish i had no need to spare him but there were things he had to do elsewhere his zeal is equal to mine in all those matters and i suppose that when i feared the work i feared him too as my greatest helper in itward paused and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think he felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the charles ward he knew willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results it was the same with all the alienists later on important sections of charles wards store of mental images mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life had been unaccountably expunged whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual the youths intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy and he tried his best to hide it when willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided byit was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriffs wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in mr douglass histrionick academy in king street on the eleventh of february 1762 which fell on a thursday or about how the actors cut the text of steelesconscious loversso badly that one was almost glad the baptistridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later that thomas sabins boston coach was damnd uncomfortable old letters may well have told but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of epenetus olneys new signboard the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the crown coffee house was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in pawtuxet were playingward however would not be quizzed long in this vein modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom what he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning to this end he offered to shew willett the entire house and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic willett looked sharply but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the wide gaps on wards shelves at home and that the meagre socalled laboratory was the flimsiest sort of a blind clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere but just where it was impossible to say essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name willett returned to town before evening and told the senior ward everything which had occurred they agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then above all mrs ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her sons own strange typed notes would permitmr ward now determined to call in person upon his son making it wholly a surprise visit dr willett took him in his car one evening guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return the session was a long one and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state his reception had developed much like willetts save that charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the portuguese away with an imperative demand and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection the lights had been dim yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously he had not spoken out loud at all averring that his throat was in very poor condition but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that mr ward could not banish it from his mindnow definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youths mental salvation mr ward and dr willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region dr willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure and from all he heard he could tell that young wards life had become indeed a strange one common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evillooking mulatto and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood for a household of only three these quantities were quite absurdthen there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth reports of these things were harder to pin down but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials noises of a ritual nature positively existed and at times when the bungalow was dark they might of course have come from the known cellar but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts recalling the ancient tales of joseph curwens catacombs and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture willett and mr ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention and searched many times without success for the door in the riverbank which old manuscripts mentioned as to popular opinions of the bungalows various inhabitants it was soon plain that the brava portuguese was loathed the bearded and spectacled dr allen feared and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent during the last week or two ward had obviously changed much abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forthsuch were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there and over these mr ward and dr willett held many long and serious conferences they strove to exercise deduction induction and constructive imagination to their utmost extent and to correlate every known fact of charless later life including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old joseph curwen they would have given much for a glimpse of the papers charles had found for very clearly the key to the youths madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings4and yet after all it was from no step of mr wards or dr willetts that the next move in this singular case proceeded the father and the physician rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other officials who knew charles ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible he could he said form no written characters at all except with great difficulty and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters even those to his father and mother who would bear out the assertionwhat made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious nor even the pawtuxet gossip of which one or two of them had caught echoes it was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before something was wrong for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech there could be no normal reason for this illconcealed blankness on vital points moreover although none of these men knew ward well they could not help observing the change in his language and manner they had heard he was an antiquarian but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures altogether this combination of hoarseness palsied hands bad memory and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior ward was imperativeso on the sixth of march 1928 there was a long and serious conference in mr wards office after which the utterly bewildered father summoned dr willett in a kind of helpless resignation willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note certainly the change was radical and profound and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing it had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used it was strangebut where had he seen it before on the whole it was obvious that charles was insane of that there could be no doubt and since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure it was then that the alienists were called in drs peck and waite of providence and dr lyman of boston to whom mr ward and dr willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast after scanning this material and examining the ominous note to willett they all agreed that charles wards studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents but this latter they knew they could do if at all only after a scene at the bungalow itself willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen charles find the curwen documents and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items looking up the latter at thejournalofficeon thursday the eighth of march drs willett peck lyman and waite accompanied by mr ward paid the youth their momentous call making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness charles though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance proved a far from recalcitrant subject and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies he offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon and seemed indeed to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory his conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to dr willett and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria he insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity of the whereabouts of dr allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed in paying off the stolid brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint he was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all it was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory his lost voice and handwriting and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him his mother it was agreed was not to be told of the change his father supplying typed notes in his name ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by dr waite on conanicut island in the bay and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case it was then that the physical oddities were noticed the slackened metabolism the altered skin and the disproportionate neural reactions dr willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners for he had attended ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before and which made willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places the doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witchtrial record from salem which charles had shewn him in the old nonsecretive days and which read mr

curwen and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careerswhile ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to dr allen which mr ward had ordered delivered at the family home willett had predicted that very little would be found since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger but in the latter part of march there did come a letter from prague for dr allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought it was in a very crabbed and archaic hand and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner shewed almost as singular a departure from modern english as the speech of young ward

degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply so the absent dr allen and not charles ward had come to be the leading spirit at pawtuxet that must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youths last frantic letter and what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as mr j c there was no escaping the inference but there are limits to possible monstrosity who was simon o the old man ward had visited in prague four years previously perhaps but in the centuries behind there had been another simon osimon orne alias jedediah of salem who vanished in 1771and whose peculiar handwriting dr willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the orne formulae which charles had once shewn himwhat horrors and mysteries what contradictions and contraventions of nature had come back after a century and a half to harass old providence with her clustered spires and domesthe father and the old physician virtually at a loss what to do or think went to see charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about dr allen about the prague visit and about what he had learned of simon or jedediah orne of salem to all these inquiries the youth was politely noncommittal merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found dr allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in prague would probably be similarly gifted when they left mr ward and dr willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism and that without imparting anything vital himself the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the prague letter had containeddrs peck waite and lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young wards companion for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together and believed that charles or allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpartperhaps one who had seen ornes handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone characters reincarnation allen himself was perhaps a similar case and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the longdead curwen such things had been known before and on the same basis the hardheaded doctors disposed of willetts growing disquiet about charles wards present handwriting as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old joseph curwen himself but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues willett advised mr ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for dr allen on the second of april from rakus transylvania in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal this read as followscastle

consulte these matters innephrenka nai hadothedw hfor j curwen esqprovidencebut if willett and mr ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves no amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled dr allen of whom charless frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of curwens old salem colleagues that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of joseph curwen and that he entertainedor was at least advised to entertainmurderous designs against a boy who could scarcely be other than charles ward there was organised horror afoot and no matter who had started it the missing allen was by this time at the bottom of it therefore thanking heaven that charles was now safe in the hospital mr ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor finding whence he had come and what pawtuxet knew of him and if possible discovering his current whereabouts supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which charles yielded up he urged them to explore allens vacant room which had been identified when the patients belongings had been packed obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about mr ward talked with the detectives in his sons old library and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanationv a nightmare and a cataclysm1and now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of marinus bicknell willett and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind dr willett had conferred at length with mr ward and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule there was they conceded a terrible movement alive in the world whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the salem witchcraft could not be doubted that at least two living menand one other of whom they dared not thinkwere in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws what these horrible creaturesand charles ward as wellwere doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case they were robbing the tombs of all the ages including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed thema hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group they had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive either in the same body or different bodies and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together there had it seems been some truth in chimerical old borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain essential saltes from which the shade of a longdead living thing might be raised up there was a formula for evoking such a shade and another for putting it down and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully one must be careful about evocations for the markers of old graves are not always accuratewillett and mr ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion thingspresences or voices of some sortcould be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave and in this process also one must be careful joseph curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things and as for charleswhat might one think of him what forces outside the spheres had reached him from joseph curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things he had been led to find certain directions and he had used them he had talked with the man of horror in prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of transylvania and he must have found the grave of joseph curwen at last that newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook then he had summoned something and it must have come that mighty voice aloft on good friday and thosedifferenttones in the locked attic laboratory what were they like with their depth and hollowness was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger dr allen with his spectral bass yesthatwas what mr ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the manif man it wereover the telephonewhat hellish consciousness or voice what morbid shade or presence had come to answer charles wards secret rites behind that locked door those voices heard in argumentmust have it red for three monthsgood god was not that just before the vampirism broke out the rifling of ezra weedens ancient grave and the cries later at pawtuxetwhose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies and then the bungalow and the bearded stranger and the gossip and the fear the final madness of charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain but they did feel sure that the mind of joseph curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility allen had something to do with it and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life in the meantime since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute some effort must be made to find it willett and mr ward conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground explorationthe morning of april 6th dawned clear and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock mr ward had the key and an entry and cursory survey were made from the disordered condition of dr allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value of course the main business lay in the cellar so thither they descended without much delay again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner for a time everything seemed baffling each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young ward and his associates where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome meansthe doctor tried to put himself in charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start but could not gain much inspiration from this method then he decided on elimination as a policy and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal trying to account for every inch separately he was soon substantially narrowed down and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs which he had tried once before in vain now experimenting in every possible way and exerting a double strength he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole to which mr ward at once rushed with excited zeal the cover was not hard to lift and the father had quite removed it when willett noticed the queerness of his aspect he was swaying and nodding dizzily and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample causein a moment dr willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water mr ward responded feebly but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him wishing to take no chances willett hastened out to broad street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weakvoiced protests after which he produced an electric torch covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze and descended once more to peer into the newfound depths the foul air had now slightly abated and willett was able to send a beam of light down the stygian hole for about ten feet he saw it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building2willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf he could not help thinking of what luke fenner had reported on that last monstrous night then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance slowly as befitted one of his years he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below this was ancient masonry his torch told him and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries down down ran the steps not spirally but in three abrupt turns and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty he had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly and after that he did not feel disposed to count any moreit was a godless sound one of those lowkeyed insidious outrages of nature which are not meant to be to call it a dull wail a doomdragged whine or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soulsickening overtones was it for this that ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed it was the most shocking thing that willett had ever heard and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways the hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad its pavement was of large chipped flagstones and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry its length he could not imagine for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness of the archways some had doors of the old sixpanelled colonial type whilst others had noneovercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling willett began to explore these archways one by one finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses most of them had fireplaces the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders for many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of joseph curwens experimentation finally there came a room of obvious modernity or at least of recent occupancy there were oil heaters bookshelves and tables chairs and cabinets and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places and finding a matchsafe handy willett lighted such as were ready for usein the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of charles ward of the books the doctor had seen many before and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the prospect street mansion here and there was a piece well known to willett and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps his first duty as planned long ahead was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance especially those portentous documents found by charles so long ago behind the picture in olney court as he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing once he found large packets of letters with prague and rakus postmarks and in writing clearly recognisable as ornes and hutchinsons all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valiseat last in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the ward home willett found the batch of old curwen papers recognising them from the reluctant glimpse charles had granted him so many years ago the youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to orne and hutchinson and the cipher with its key willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files since young wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted the oddity was the slight amount in charless normal writing which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before on the other hand there were literally reams of symbols and formulae historical notes and philosophical comment in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of joseph curwen though of undeniably modern dating plainly a part of the latterday programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing which charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection of any third hand which might have been allens there was not a trace if he had indeed come to be the leader he must have forced young ward to act as his amanuensisin this new material one mystic formula or rather pair of formulae recurred so often that willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest it consisted of two parallel columns the lefthand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called dragons head and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node and the righthand one headed by a corresponding sign of dragons tail or descending node the appearance of the whole was something like this and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd nameyogsothothwhich he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter the formulae were as followsexactlyso as willett is abundantly able to testifyand the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible good friday of the previous yearyai ngngahyogsothothheelgebfai throdoguaaahogthrod aifgebleehyogsothothngahng aiyzhroso haunting were these formulae and so frequently did he come upon them that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath eventually however he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid he had still to find the hidden laboratory so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whinethe next few rooms he tried were all abandoned or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominouslooking leaden coffins but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of joseph curwens original operations he thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world and of what that final raiding party must have seen and then he decided it was better not to think any more once a great stone staircase mounted at his right and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the curwen outbuildingsperhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slitlike windowsprovided the steps he had descended had led from the steeproofed farmhouse suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead and the stench and the wailing grew stronger willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space so great that his torchlight would not carry across it and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roofafter a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of stonehenge with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light but when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines instead he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry these cells were empty but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued more insistent now than ever and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping3from that frightful smell and that uncanny noise willetts attention could no longer be diverted both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else and carried a vague impression of being far below even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down the doctor cast his beam of light about the stoneflagged floor it was very loosely paved and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down to this ladder singularly enough appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything as he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs as if they might be crude trapdoors leading down to some still deeper region of horror kneeling by one he worked at it with his hands and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it at his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone a stench unnamable now rose up from below and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blacknessif he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination willett was destined to be disappointed for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brickfaced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent as the light shone down the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind futile scrambling and slippery thumping the explorer trembled unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the roughhewn brink lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below for a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy mossgrown brick walls sinking illimitably into that halftangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft which must have been from twenty to twentyfive feet below the stone floor where he lay the torch shook in his hand but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well left starving by young ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern whatever the things were they could not lie down in their cramped spaces but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheededbut marinus bicknell willett was sorry that he looked again for surgeon and veteran of the dissectingroom though he was he has not been the same since it is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision in that second look willett saw such an outline or entity for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of dr waites private hospital he dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit he screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries he tore his hands on the rough loose stones and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars but still he kept on then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided he was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror and crushed with a memory he never could efface beneath him dozens of those things still lived and from one of the shafts the cover was removed he knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foothold might existwhat the thing was he would never tell it was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar but it was alive nature had never made it in this form for it was too palpablyunfinishedthe deficiencies were of the most surprising sort and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which ward called up fromimperfect saltsand which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes if it had not had a certain significance its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone it was not the worst thing depicted on that stonebut willett never opened the other pits at the time the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old curwen data he had digested long before a phrase used by simon or jedediah orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer certainely there was nothg butt yeliveliest awfulness in that which h raisd upp from what he coud gather onlie a part ofthen horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned twisted thing found in the fields a week after the curwen raid charles ward had once told the doctor what old slocum said of that object that it was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read aboutthese words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro squatting on the nitrous stone floor he tried to drive them out and repeated the lords prayer to himself eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodgepodge like the modernisticwaste landof mr t s eliot and finally reverting to the oftrepeated dual formula he had lately found in wards underground libraryyai ngngah yogsothothand so on till the final underlinedzhroit seemed to soothe him and he staggered to his feet after a time lamenting bitterly his frightlost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air think he would not but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library after a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncoveredonce his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar and from this spot he recoiled in loathing at another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed and here his caution became almost pitiful but he did not come upon the dread aperture after all nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him what had been down there made no sound nor stir evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it each time willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled his passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below but generally it would produce no effect at all since he moved very noiselessly several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one the thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit for he knew that once the light failed his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party mr ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period presently however he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right in a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young wards secret library trembling with relief and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety4in another moment he was hastily filling the burnedout lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration for racked though he was with horror his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind charles wards bizarre madness failing to find a lantern he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry also filling his pockets with candles and matches and taking with him a gallon can of oil which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells to traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude but he knew it must be done fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cellindented wall which bounded the cavern area and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical searchso willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects one was packed with rotting and dustdraped bales of spare clothing and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before in another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men but what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared these and the sinister incrustations upon them he liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt when he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come and out of which many doors opened this he proceeded to investigate and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose businesslike tanks and tables furnaces and modern instruments occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the longsought laboratory of charles wardand no doubt of old joseph curwen before himafter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready dr willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry on the whole little could be learned from the scientific ensemble which included a gruesomelooking dissecting table so that the room was really rather a disappointment among the books was a tattered old copy of borellus in blackletter and it was weirdly interesting to note that ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good mr merritt at curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before that older copy of course must have perished along with the rest of curwens occult library in the final raid three archways opened off the laboratory and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn from his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms but these he canvassed with care remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffinplates he could decipher there was much clothing also stored in these rooms and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate most interesting of all perhaps were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old joseph curwens laboratory appliances these had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the georgian periodthe third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps these lamps willett lighted and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him some of the upper levels were wholly vacant but most of the space was filled with small oddlooking leaden jars of two general types one tall and without handles like a grecian lekythos or oiljug and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a phaleron jug all had metal stoppers and were covered with peculiarlooking symbols moulded in low relief in a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading custodes above them and all the phalerons on the other correspondingly labelled with a sign reading materia each of the jars or jugs except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue and willett resolved to look for the latter presently for the moment however he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation the result was invariable both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull neutral colour to the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the phalerons a bluishgrey powder might be by the side of a pinkishwhite one and any one in a phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos the most individual feature about the powders was their nonadhesiveness willett would pour one into his hand and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palmthe meaning of the two signs puzzled him and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper custodes materia that was the latin for guards and materials respectivelyand then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word guards before in connexion with this dreadful mystery it was of course in the recent letter to dr allen purporting to be from old edward hutchinson and the phrase had read there was no neede to keep the guards in shape and eatg off their heads and it made much to be founde in case of trouble as you too welle knowe what did this signify but waitwas there not stillanotherreference to guards in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the hutchinson letter back in the old nonsecretive days ward had told him of the eleazar smith diary recording the spying of smith and weeden on the curwen farm and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth there had been smith and weeden insisted terrible colloquies wherein figured curwen certain captives of hisand the guards of those captivesthose guards according to hutchinson or his avatar had eaten their heads off so that now dr allen did not keep themin shapeand if notin shapehow save as the salts to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they couldsothatwas what these lekythoi contained the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help when called up by some hellish incantation in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels then he thought of the materiain the myriad phaleron jugs on the other side of the room salts tooand if not the salts of guards then the salts of what god could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern as poor charles had hinted in his frantic note all civilisation all natural law perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe and marinus bicknell willett had sifted their dust through his handsthen he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above it was only a symbol but it filled him with vague spiritual dread for a morbid dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep it was the sign of koth that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilightand willett did not like what his friend randolph carter had said of its powers but a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stenchfilled air this was a chemical rather than animal smell and came clearly from the room beyond the door and it was unmistakably the same odour which had saturated charles wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away so it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons he was wiser than old joseph curwen for he had not resisted willett boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold a wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition there was nothing alive here to harm him and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patientthe room beyond the door was of medium size and had no furniture save a table a single chair and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels which willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture on one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like grecian kylikes on the other side was the table with a powerful argand lamp a pad and pencil and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad to see what notes young ward might have been jotting down when interrupted but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed curwen chirography which shed no light on the case as a wholeb dyd not escapd into walls and founde place belowsaw olde v saye yesabaoth and learnt yewayraisdyogsothoththrice and was yenexte day deliverdf soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise those from outsideas the strong argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapelesslooking robes of a rather dismal yellowishwhite but far more interesting were the two vacant walls both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone the damp floor also bore marks of carving and with but little difficulty willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner in one of these four circles near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whiprack and just outside the periphery was one of the phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room its tag numbered 118 this was unstoppered and proved upon inspection to be empty but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not within its shallow area and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern lay a small amount of a dry dullgreenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug and willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene the whips and the instruments of torture the dust or salts from the jug of materia the two lekythoi from the custodes shelf the robes the formulae on the walls the notes on the pad the hints from letters and legends and the thousand glimpses doubts and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of charles wardall these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floorwith an effort however willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls from the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in joseph curwens time and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic one the doctor clearly recognised as what mrs ward heard her son chanting on that ominous good friday a year before and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres it was not spelled here exactly as mrs ward had set it down from memory nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of eliphas levi but its identity was unmistakable and such words assabaoth metraton almousinandzariatnatmiksent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the cornerthis was on the lefthand wall as one entered the room the righthand wall was no less thickly inscribed and willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library they were roughly speaking the same with the ancient symbols of dragons head and dragons tail heading them as in wards scribblings but the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions as if old curwen had had a different way of recording sound or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question the doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head and found it hard to do where the script he had memorised beganyai ngngah yogsothoththis epigraph started out asaye engengah yoggesothothawhich to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second wordground as the later text was into his consciousness the discrepancy disturbed him and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice its accents keyed to a droning singsong either through the spell of the past and the unknown or through the hellish example of that dull godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darknessyai ngngahyogsothothheelgebfai throdoguaaahbut what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant the lamps were sputtering woefully and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight there was smoke too and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the faraway wells an odour like that he had smelt before yet infinitely stronger and more pungent he turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents and saw that the kylix on the floor in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain was giving forth a cloud of thick greenishblack vapour of surprising volume and opacity that powdergreat god it had come from the shelf of materiawhat was it doing now and what had started it the formula he had been chantingthe first of the pairdragons headascending nodeblessed saviour could it be the doctor reeled and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen heard and read of the frightful case of joseph curwen and charles dexter ward i say to you againe doe not call up any that you can not put downe have yewordes for laying at all times readie and stopp not to be sure when there is any doubte ofwhomyou have three talkes withwhat was therein inhumd mercy of heaven what is that shape behind the parting smoke5marinus bicknell willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old he has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance but mr ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar did not willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening and again the next day and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs willett had been breathing stertorously and opened his eyes slowly when mr ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car then he shuddered and screamed crying outthat beard those eyes god who are youa very strange thing to say to a trim blueeyed cleanshaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhoodin the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees and only a faint acrid odour reminded mr ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital the doctors flashlight was missing but his valise was safely there as empty as when he had brought it before indulging in any explanations and obviously with great moral effort willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs it was unyielding crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one underneath the smooth concrete was still visible but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs only the smooth concrete underneath the planksno noisome well no world of subterrene horrors no secret library no curwen papers no nightmare pits of stench and howling no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae no dr willett turned pale and clutched at the younger man yesterday he asked softly did you see it here and smell it and when mr ward himself transfixed with dread and wonder found strength to nod an affirmative the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp and nodded in turn then i will tell you he saidso for an hour in the sunniest room they could find upstairs the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father there was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenishblack vapour from the kylix parted and willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred there were futile bewildered headshakings from both men and once mr ward ventured a hushed suggestion do you suppose it would be of any use to dig the doctor was silent for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the great abyss again mr ward asked but where did it go it brought you here you know and it sealed up the hole somehow and willett again let silence answer for himbut after all this was not the final phase of the matter reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave dr willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault it was a common sheet torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencildoubtless the one which had lain beside the pad it was folded very carelessly and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this but in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder for here was no script of any wholesome age but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar the briefly scrawled message was this and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair who forthwith walked steadily out to the ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the john hay library on the hillat the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier in the end they found what was needed the letters were indeed no fantastic invention but the normal script of a very dark period they were the pointed saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century ad and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily and the pale moon of britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the roman ruins of caerleon and hexham and by the towers along hadrians crumbling wall the words were in such latin as a barbarous age might remembercorvinus necandus est cadaver aqua forti dissolvendum nec aliquid retinendum tace ut poteswhich may roughly be translated curwen must be killed the body must be dissolved in aqua fortis nor must anything be retained keep silence as best you are ablewillett and mr ward were mute and baffled they had met the unknown and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought with willett especially the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was wellnigh exhausted and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave then they drove listlessly to the ward mansion in prospect street and talked to no purpose into the night the doctor rested toward morning but did not go home and he was still there sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up dr allenmr ward who was pacing nervously about in a dressinggown answered the call in person and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready both willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message it seemed certain that the curwen who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger charles had feared this man and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid allen moreover had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in europe under the name of curwen and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer and now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that curwen must be killed and dissolved in acid the linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious and besides was not allen planning to murder young ward upon the advice of the creature called hutchinson of course the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger but from its text they could see that allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish without doubt allen must be apprehended and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon charles wardthat afternoon hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young charles at the hospital simply and gravely willett told him all he had found and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery the physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could and watched for a wincing on charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within but ward did not wince willett paused and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving he taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply for charles having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him then he whispered in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used damn em theydoeat but theydont need tothats the rare part a month you say without food lud sir you be modest dye know that was the joke on poor old whipple with his virtuous bluster kill everything off would he why damme he was halfdeaf with the noise from outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells he never dreamed they were there at all devil take yethose cursed things have been howling down there ever since curwen was done for a hundred and fiftyseven years gonebut no more than this could willett get from the youth horrified yet almost convinced against his will he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained looking at the youths face the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought truly the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies when the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned charles shewed his first sign of animation a quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what willett had read on the pad and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic but he added had you but known the words to bring up that which i had out in the cup you had not been here to tell me this twas number 118 and i conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room twas never raised by me but i meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hitherthen willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenishblack smoke which had arisen and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on charles wards face itcameand you be here alive as ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance willett gifted with a flash of inspiration believed he saw the situation and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered no 118 you say but dont forget thatstones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten you are never sure till you questionand then without warning he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes he could have wished no stronger result for charles ward fainted forthwithall this conversation of course had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions unaided too dr willett and mr ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch in reviving the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to orne and hutchinson at once so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy and had given dr allen advice for his assassination this revelation produced no visible effect and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man after that he would converse no more so willett and the father departed presently leaving behind a caution against the bearded allen to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of and could do no one any harm even if he wished this was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear they did not worry about any communications charles might indite to that monstrous pair in europe since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outrlooking missivethere is however a curious sequel to the matter of orne and hutchinson if such indeed the exiled wizards were moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period willett arranged with an international presscutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in prague and in eastern transylvania and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated one was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of prague and the disappearance of the evil old man called josef nadek who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember the other was a titan explosion in the transylvanian mountains east of rakus and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the illregarded castle ferenczy whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well and that while curwen was left to him to dispose of the writer felt able to find and deal with orne and hutchinson itself of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think6the following morning dr willett hastened to the ward home to be present when the detectives arrived allens destruction or imprisonmentor curwens if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as validhe felt must be accomplished at any cost and he communicated this conviction to mr ward as they sat waiting for the men to come they were downstairs this time for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished curwen portraitat nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say they had not regrettably enough located the brava tony gomes as they had wished nor had they found the least trace of dr allens source or present whereabouts but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger allen had struck pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being and there was an universal belief that his thick vandyke beard was either dyed or falsea belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard together with a pair of dark glasses in his room at the fateful bungalow his voice mr ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and hornrimmed glasses one shopkeeper in the course of negotiations had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant in connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer a majority of the gossips believed that allen rather than ward was the actual vampire statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery they had felt less of the sinister in dr allen but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage the place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly but they would know him again if they saw him his beard had looked odd and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye as for the detectives search of allens room it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young ward found in the vanished catacombs of horrordr willett and mr ward caught something of a profound subtle and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded and almost trembled in following up the vague mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds the false beard and glassesthe crabbed curwen penmanshipthe old portrait and its tiny scarand the altered youth in the hospital with such a scarthat deep hollow voice on the telephonewas it not of this that mr ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced who had ever seen charles and allen together yes the officials had once but who later on was it not when allen left that charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow curwenallenwardin what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved that damnable resemblance of the picture to charleshad it not used to stare and stare and follow the boy around the room with its eyes why too did both allen and charles copy joseph curwens handwriting even when alone and off guard and then the frightful work of those peoplethe lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight the starved monsters in the noisome pits the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results the message in minuscules found in willetts pocket the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and salts and discoverieswhither did everything lead in the end mr ward did the most sensible thing steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous dr allen that article was a photograph of his luckless son on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from allens roomfor two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered then the men returned yesthe altered photograph was a very passable likeness of dr allenmr ward turned pale and willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief allenwardcurwenit was becoming too hideous for coherent thought what had the boy called out of the void and what had it done to him what really had happened from first to last who was this allen who sought to kill charles as too squeamish and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid why too had the minuscule message of whose origin no one dared think said that curwen must be likewise obliterated what was thechangeand when had the final stage occurred that day when his frantic note was receivedhe had been nervous all the morning then there was an alteration he had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him that was the time when he was out but nohad he not cried out in terror as he entered his studythis very room what had he found there or waitwhat had found himthat simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to gowas that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all had not the butler spoken of queer noiseswillett rang for the man and asked him some lowtoned questions it had surely enough been a bad business there had been noisesa cry a gasp a choking and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping or all of these and mr charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word the butler shivered as he spoke and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs terror had settled definitely upon the house and only the businesslike detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it even they were restless for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all dr willett was thinking deeply and rapidly and his thoughts were terrible ones now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new appalling and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happeningsthen mr ward made a sign that the conference was over and everyone save him and the doctor left the room it was noon now but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantomhaunted mansion willett began talking very seriously to his host and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him there would be he predicted certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative as family physician he must have a free hand and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when joseph curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panelmr ward dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side could only acquiesce and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from olney court the father listening outside heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed and finally a wrench and a creak as if a tight cupboard door were being opened then there was a muffled cry a kind of snorting choke and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened almost at once the key rattled and willett appeared in the hall haggard and ghastly and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room the furnace was not enough he said and the electric log had little practical use longing yet not daring to ask questions mr ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the july before they were in a covered basket and mr ward never saw what they werethen the doctor locked himself in the library once more and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire later after a great rustling of newspapers that odd wrench and creaking were heard again followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked thereafter two suppressed cries of willetts were heard and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes mr wards head reeled and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down after an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten and halfformless sounds of scraping sweeping and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door and at last after the slamming of some cupboard within willett made his appearancesad pale and haggard and bearing the clothdraped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory he had left the window open and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants the ancient overmantel still lingered but it seemed robbed of malignity now and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of joseph curwen night was coming on yet this time its shadows held no latent fright but only a gentle melancholy of what he had done the doctor would never speak to mr ward he said i can answer no questions but i will say that there are different kinds of magic i have made a great purgation and those in this house will sleep the better for it7that dr willetts purgation had been an ordeal almost as nerveracking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening for three days he rested constantly in his room though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on wednesday when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness servants imaginations fortunately are limited else comment might have been excited by an item in thursdaysevening bulletinwhich ran as followsnorth end ghoulsactive againafter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the weeden lot at the north burial ground a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by robert hart the night watchman happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 am hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light at once starting in pursuit he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possiblelike the first of the ghouls active during the past year this intruder had done no real damage before detection a vacant part of the ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted and no previous grave had been disturbedhart who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source but police from the second station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shatteredthe first of the incidents in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated occurred a year ago last march and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache it is possible says sergt riley that this third affair is of similar nature officers at the second station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outragesall day thursday dr willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come in the evening he wrote a note to mr ward which was delivered the next morning and which caused the halfdazed parent to ponder long and deeply mr ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of monday with its baffling reports and its sinister purgation but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke10 barnes stprovidence riapril 12 1928dear theodorei feel that i must say a word to you before doing what i am going to do tomorrow it will conclude the terrible business we have been going through for i feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of but im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless i expressly assure you how very conclusive it isyou have known me ever since you were a small boy so i think you will not distrust me when i hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored it is better that you attempt no further speculation as to charless case and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects when i call on you tomorrow charles will have escaped that is all which need remain in anyones mind he was mad and he escaped you can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name id advise you to join her in atlantic city and take a rest yourself god knows you need one after this shock as i do myself i am going south for a while to calm down and brace upso dont ask me any questions when i call it may be that something will go wrong but ill tell you if it does i dont think it will there will be nothing more to worry about for charles will be very very safe he is nowsafer than you dream you need hold no fears about allen and who or what he is he forms as much a part of the past as joseph curwens picture and when i ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person and what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yoursbut you must steel yourself to melancholy and prepare your wife to do the same i must tell you frankly that charless escape will not mean his restoration to you he has been afflicted with a peculiar disease as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him and you must not hope to see him again have only this consolationthat he was never a fiend or even truly a madman but only an eager studious and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing he stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach and something came out of those years to engulf himand now comes the matter in which i must ask you to trust me most of all for there will be indeed no uncertainty about charless fate in about a year say you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end for the boy will be no more you can put up a stone in your lot at the north burial ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way and that will mark the true restingplace of your son nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling the ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinewof the real charles dexter ward whose mind you watched from infancythe real charles with the olivemark on his hip and without the black witchmark on his chest or the pit on his forehead the charles who never did actual evil and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishnessthat is all charles will have escaped and a year from now you can put up his stone do not question me tomorrow and believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now as it has been at all times in the pastwith profoundest sympathy and exhortations to fortitude calmness and resignation i am eversincerely your friendmarinus b willettso on the morning of friday april 13 1928 marinus bicknell willett visited the room of charles dexter ward at dr waites private hospital on conanicut island the youth though making no attempt to evade his caller was in a sullen mood and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which willett obviously desired the doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities then a new element of constraint crept in as ward seemed to read behind the doctors masklike face a terrible purpose which had never been there before the patient quailed conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avengerward actually turned pale and the doctor was the first to speak more he said has been found out and i must warn you fairly that a reckoning is duedigging again and coming upon more poor starving pets was the ironic reply it was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the lastno willett slowly rejoined this time i did not have to dig we have had men looking up dr allen and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalowexcellent commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting and i trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have onthey would become you very well came the even and studied responseas indeed they seem to have doneas willett said this it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun though there was no change in the shadows on the floor then ward venturedand is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofoldno said willett gravely again you are wrong it is no business of mine if any man seeks dualityprovided he has any right to exist at all and provided he does not destroy what called him out of spaceward now started violently well sir whathaveye found and what dye want with methe doctor let a little time elapse before replying as if choosing his words for an effective answeri have found he finally intoned something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was and i have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of charles dexter ward ought to bethe madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sittingdamn ye who did ye telland wholl believe it was he after these full two months with me alive what dye mean to dowillett though a small man actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesturei have told no one this is no common caseit is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with thank god some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination that i might not go astray in thinking out this thingyou cannot deceive me joseph curwen for i know that your accursed magic is truei know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant i know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave i know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him i know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombsand at what you planned afterwardand i know how you did ityou left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house they thought it was he who went in and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him but you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds you were a fool curwen to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting it hasnt worked you see after all you know better than i who or what wrote that message in minuscules but i will warn you it was not written in vain there are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out and i believe that the writer of those words will attend to orne and hutchinson one of those creatures wrote you once do not call up any that you can not put down you were undone once before perhaps in that very way and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again curwen a man cant tamper with nature beyond certain limits and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you outbut here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him hopelessly at bay weaponless and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue joseph curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep hollow voice now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formulaper adonai eloim adonai jehova adonai sabaoth metraton but willett was too quick for him even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite an eye for an eyemagic for magiclet the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned so in a clear voice marinus bicknell willett began thesecondof that pair of formulae whose

could be pronouncedbut he did not faint and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again the madness out of time had subsided and the case of charles dexter ward was closed opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror dr willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss there had as he had predicted been no need for acids for like his accursed picture a year before joseph curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluishgrey dust,1
it is said that in ulthar which lies beyond the river skai no man may kill a cat and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire for the cat is cryptic and close to strange things which men cannot see he is the soul of antique aegyptus and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in mero and ophir he is the kin of the jungles lords and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa the sphinx is his cousin and he speaks her language but he is more ancient than the sphinx and remembers that which she hath forgottenin ulthar before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours why they did this i know not save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight but whatever the reason this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel and from some of the sounds heard after dark many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard in truth much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk they feared them more and instead of berating them as brutal assassins merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed and sounds heard after dark the loser would lament impotently or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished for the people of ulthar were simple and knew not whence it is all cats first cameone day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar dark wanderers they were and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year in the marketplace they told fortunes for silver and bought gay beads from the merchants what was the land of these wanderers none could tell but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats hawks rams and lions and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the hornsthere was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother but only a tiny black kitten to cherish the plague had not been kind to him yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow and when one is very young one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sate playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagonon the third morning of the wanderers stay in ulthar menes could not find his kitten and as he sobbed aloud in the marketplace certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife and of sounds heard in the night and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation and finally to prayer he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming it was very peculiar but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy nebulous figures of exotic things of hybrid creatures crowned with hornflanked discs nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginativethat night the wanderers left ulthar and were never seen again and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished cats large and small black grey striped yellow and white old kranon the burgomaster swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes kitten and cursed the caravan and the little boy but nith the lean notary declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold still no one durst complain to the sinister couple even when little atal the innkeepers son vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage two abreast as if in performance of some unheardof rite of beasts the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yardso ulthar went to sleep in vain anger and when the people awaked at dawnbehold every cat was back at his accustomed hearth large and small black grey striped yellow and white none was missing very sleek and fat did the cats appear and sonorous with purring content the citizens talked with one another of the affair and marvelled not a little old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious and for two whole days the sleek lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food but only doze by the fire or in the sunit was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy cornersthere was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar zath the coroner disputed at length with nith the lean notary and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions even little atal the innkeepers son was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward they talked of the old cotter and his wife of the caravan of dark wanderers of small menes and his black kitten of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yardand in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travellers in nir namely that in ulthar no man may kill a cat,1
in a dream kuranes saw the city in the valley and the seacoast beyond and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward the distant regions where the sea meets the sky in a dream it was also that he came by his name of kuranes for when awake he was called by another name perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name for he was the last of his family and alone among the indifferent millions of london so there were not many to speak to him and remind him who he had been his money and lands were gone and he did not care for the ways of people about him but preferred to dream and write of his dreams what he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he shewed it so that after a time he kept his writings to himself and finally ceased to write the more he withdrew from the world about him the more wonderful became his dreams and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper kuranes was not modern and did not think like others who wrote whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality kuranes sought for beauty alone when truth and experience failed to reveal it he sought it in fancy and illusion and found it on his very doorstep amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and dreamsthere are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth for when as children we listen and dream we think but halfformed thoughts and when as men we try to remember we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life but some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens of fountains that sing in the sun of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas of plains that stretch down to sleeping cities of bronze and stone and of shadowy companies of heroes that ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests and then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappykuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood he had been dreaming of the house where he was born the great stone house covered with ivy where thirteen generations of his ancestors had lived and where he had hoped to die it was moonlight and he had stolen out into the fragrant summer night through the gardens down the terraces past the great oaks of the park and along the long white road to the village the village seemed very old eaten away at the edge like the moon which had commenced to wane and kuranes wondered whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death in the streets were spears of long grass and the windowpanes on either side were either broken or filmily staring kuranes had not lingered but had plodded on as though summoned toward some goal he dared not disobey the summons for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life which do not lead to any goal then he had been drawn down a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs and had come to the end of thingsto the precipice and the abyss where all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing emptiness of infinity and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit by the crumbling moon and the peering stars faith had urged him on over the precipice and into the gulf where he had floated down down down past dark shapeless undreamed dreams faintly glowing spheres that may have been partly dreamed dreams and laughing winged things that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds then a rift seemed to open in the darkness before him and he saw the city of the valley glistening radiantly far far below with a background of sea and sky and a snowcapped mountain near the shorekuranes had awaked the very moment he beheld the city yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephas in the valley of oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm seabreeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village he had protested then when they had found him waked him and carried him home for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky and now he was equally resentful of awaking for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary yearsbut three nights afterward kuranes came again to celephas as before he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead and of the abyss down which one must float silently then the rift appeared again and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour and watched the gingko trees of mount aran swaying in the seabreeze but this time he was not snatched away and like a winged being settled gradually over a grassy hillside till finally his feet rested gently on the turf he had indeed come back to the valley of oothnargai and the splendid city of celephasdown the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked kuranes over the bubbling naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he had carved his name so many years ago and through the whispering grove to the great stone bridge by the city gate all was as of old nor were the marble walls discoloured nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished and kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he knew be vanished for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same and still as young as he remembered them when he entered the city past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements the merchants and cameldrivers greeted him as if he had never been away and it was the same at the turquoise temple of nathhorthath where the orchidwreathed priests told him that there is no time in oothnargai but only perpetual youth then kuranes walked through the street of pillars to the seaward wall where gathered the traders and sailors and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky there he stayed long gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun and where rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the skymore than ever kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he had heard so many strange tales and he sought again the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago he found the man athib sitting on the same chest of spices he had sat upon before and athib seemed not to realise that any time had passed then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour and giving orders to the oarsmen commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenerian sea that leads to the sky for several days they glided undulatingly over the water till finally they came to the horizon where the sea meets the sky here the galley paused not at all but floated easily in the blue of the sky among fleecy clouds tinted with rose and far beneath the keel kuranes could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or disappear at length athib told him that their journey was near its end and that they would soon enter the harbour of serannian the pink marble city of the clouds which is built on that ethereal coast where the west wind flows into the sky but as the highest of the citys carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space and kuranes awaked in his london garretfor many months after that kuranes sought the marvellous city of celephas and its skybound galleys in vain and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and unheardof places no one whom he met could tell him how to find oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills one night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint lone campfires at great distances apart and strange shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders and in the wildest part of this hilly country so remote that few men could ever have seen it he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers green foliage and lawns white paths diamond brooks blue lakelets carven bridges and redroofed pagodas that he for a moment forgot celephas in sheer delight but he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a redroofed pagoda and would have questioned the people of that land about it had he not found that there were no people there but only birds and bees and butterflies on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon and in the silent city that spread away from the riverbank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before he would have descended and asked the way to oothnargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city and the stagnation of the reedy river and the death lying upon that land as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the godsso kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of celephas and its galleys that sail to serannian in the sky meanwhile seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery on the cold desert plateau of leng in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep hasheesh helped a great deal and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence and a violetcoloured gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had called infinity the gas had not heard of planets and organisms before but identified kuranes merely as one from the infinity where matter energy and gravitation exist kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaretstudded celephas and increased his doses of drugs but eventually he had no more money left and could buy no drugs then one summer day he was turned out of his garret and wandered aimlessly through the streets drifting over a bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner and it was there that fulfilment came and he met the cortege of knights come from celephas to bear him thither foreverhandsome knights they were astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of clothofgold curiously emblazoned so numerous were they that kuranes almost mistook them for an army but their leader told him they were sent in his honour since it was he who had created oothnargai in his dreams on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore then they gave kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade and all rode majestically through the downs of surrey and onward toward the region where kuranes and his ancestors were born it was very strange but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through time for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villages as chaucer or men before him might have seen and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers when it grew dark they travelled more swiftly till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air in the dim dawn they came upon the village which kuranes had seen alive in his childhood and asleep or dead in his dreams it was alive now and early villagers courtesied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dream kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night and wondered what it would look like by day so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies the abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations endlessly down the horsemen floated their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness the brightness of the city celephas and the seacoast beyond and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the skyand kuranes reigned thereafter over oothnargai and all the neighbouring regions of dream and held his court alternately in celephas and in the cloudfashioned serannian he reigns there still and will reign happily forever though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the halfdeserted village at dawn played mockingly and cast it upon the rocks by ivycovered trevor towers where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility,1
cl mooregeorge campbell opened sleepfogged eyes upon darkness and lay gazing out of the tent flap upon the pale august night for some minutes before he roused enough even to wonder what had wakened him there was in the keen clear air of these canadian woods a soporific as potent as any drug campbell lay quiet for a moment sinking slowly back into the delicious borderlands of sleep conscious of an exquisite weariness an unaccustomed sense of muscles well used and relaxed now into perfect ease these were vacations most delightful moments after allrest after toil in the clear sweet forest nightluxuriously as his mind sank backward into oblivion he assured himself once more that three long months of freedom lay before himfreedom from cities and monotony freedom from pedagogy and the university and students with no rudiments of interest in the geology he earned his daily bread by dinning into their obdurate ears freedom fromabruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him somewhere outside the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed into his peace george campbell sat up jerkily and reached for his flashlight then he laughed and put it down again straining his eyes through the midnight gloom outside where among the tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous little night beast was prowling he stretched out a long arm and groped about among the rocks at the tent door for a missile his fingers closed on a large stone and he drew back his hand to throwbut he never threw it it was such a queer thing he had come upon in the dark square crystal smooth obviously artificial with dull rounded corners the strangeness of its rock surfaces to his fingers was so remarkable that he reached again for his flashlight and turned its rays upon the thing he heldall sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up in his idle groping it was clear as rock crystal this queer smooth cube quartz unquestionably but not in its usual hexagonal crystallized form somehowhe could not guess the methodit had been wrought into a perfect cube about four inches in measurement over each worn face for it was incredibly worn the hard hard crystal was rounded now until its corners were almost gone and the thing was beginning to assume the outlines of a sphere ages and ages of wearing years almost beyond counting must have passed over this strange clear thingbut the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make out dimly in the heart of the crystal for imbedded in its center lay a little disc of a pale and nameless substance with characters incised deep upon its quartzenclosed surface wedgeshaped characters faintly reminiscent of cuneiform writinggeorge campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the little enigma in his hands puzzling helplessly how could such a thing as this have imbedded in pure rock crystal remotely a memory floated through his mind of ancient legends that called quartz crystals ice which had frozen too hard to melt again iceand wedgeshaped cuneiformsyes didnt that sort of writing originate among the sumerians who came down from the north in historys remotest beginnings to settle in the primitive mesopotamian valley then hard sense regained control and he laughed quartz of course was formed in the earliest of earths geological periods when there was nothing anywhere but heat and heaving rock ice had not come for tens of millions of years after this thing must have been formedand yetthat writing manmade surely although its characters were unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at cuneiform shapes or could there in a paleozoic world have been things with a written language who might have graven these cryptic wedges upon the quartzenveloped disc he held ormight a thing like this have fallen meteorlike out of space into the unformed rock of a still molten world could itthen he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot at the luridness of his own imagination the silence and the solitude and the queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play tricks with his common sense he shrugged and laid the crystal down at the edge of his pallet switching off the light perhaps morning and a clear head would bring him an answer to the questions that seemed so insoluble nowbut sleep did not come easily for one thing it seemed to him as he flashed off the light that the little cube had shone for a moment as if with sustained light before it faded into the surrounding dark or perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had been only his dazzled eyes that seemed to see the light forsake it reluctantly glowing in the enigmatic deeps of the thing with queer persistencehe lay there unquietly for a long while turning the unanswered questions over and over in his mind there was something about this crystal cube out of the unmeasured past perhaps from the dawn of all history that constituted a challenge that would not let him sleepa merritthe lay there it seemed to him for hours it had been the lingering light the luminescence that seemed so reluctant to die which held his mind it was as though something in the heart of the cube had awakened stirred drowsily become suddenly alert and intent upon himsheer fantasy this he stirred impatiently and flashed his light upon his watch close to one oclock three hours more before the dawn the beam fell and was focused upon the warm crystal cube he held it there closely for minutes he snapped it out then watchedthere was no doubt about it now as his eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness he saw that the strange crystal was glimmering with tiny fugitive lights deep within it like threads of sapphire lightnings they were at its center and they seemed to him to come from the pale disk with its disturbing markings and the disc itself was becoming larger the markings shifting shapes the cube was growing was it illusion brought about by the tiny lightnings he heard a sound it was the very ghost of a sound like the ghosts of harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers he bent closer it came from the cube there was squeaking in the underbrush a flurry of bodies and an agonized wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly stilled some small tragedy of the wilderness killer and prey he stepped over to where it had been enacted but could see nothing he again snapped off the flash and looked toward his tent upon the ground was a pale blue glimmering it was the cube he stooped to pick it up then obeying some obscure warning drew back his handand again he saw its glow was dying the tiny sapphire lightnings flashing fitfully withdrawing to the disc from which they had come there was no sound from ithe sat watching the luminescence glow and fade glow and fade but steadily becoming dimmer it came to him that two elements were necessary to produce the phenomenon the electric ray itself and his own fixed attention his mind must travel along the ray fix itself upon the cubes heart if its beat were to wax until whathe felt a chill of spirit as though from contact with some alien thing it was alien he knew it not of this earth not of earths life he conquered his shrinking picked up the cube and took it into the tent it was neither warm nor cold except for its weight he would not have known he held it he put it upon the table keeping the torch turned from it then stepped to the flap of the tent and closed ithe went back to the table drew up the camp chair and turned the flash directly upon the cube focusing it so far as he could upon its heart he sent all his will all his concentration along it focusing will and sight upon the disc as he had the lightas though at command the sapphire lightnings burned forth they burst from the disc into the body of the crystal cube then beat back bathing the disc and the markings again these began to change shifting moving advancing and retreating in the blue gleaming they were no longer cuneiform they were things objectshe heard the murmuring music the plucked harp strings louder grew the sound and louder and now all the body of the cube vibrated to their rhythm the crystal walls were melting growing misty as though formed of the mist of diamonds and the disc itself was growing the shapes shifting dividing and multiplying as though some door had been opened and into it companies of phantasms were pouring while brighter more bright grew the pulsing lighthe felt swift panic tried to withdraw sight and will dropped the flash the cube had no need now of the ray and he could not withdraw could not withdraw why he himself was being sucked into that disc which was now a globe within which unnameable shapes danced to a music that bathed the globe with steady radiancethere was no tent there was only a vast curtain of sparkling mist behind which shone the globe he felt himself drawn through that mist sucked through it as if by a mighty wind straight for the globeh p lovecraftas the mistblurred light of the sapphire suns grew more and more intense the outlines of the globe ahead wavered and dissolved to a churning chaos its pallor and its motion and its music all blended themselves with the engulfing mistbleaching it to a pale steelcolour and setting it undulantly in motion and the sapphire suns too melted imperceptibly into the greying infinity of shapeless pulsationmeanwhile the sense of forward outward motion grew intolerably incredibly cosmically swift every standard of speed known to earth seemed dwarfed and campbell knew that any such flight in physical reality would mean instant death to a human being even as it wasin this strange hellish hypnosis or nightmarethe quasivisual impression of meteorlike hurtling almost paralyzed his mind though there were no real points of reference in the grey pulsing void he felt that he was approaching and passing the speed of light itself finally his consciousness did go underand merciful blackness swallowed everythingit was very suddenly and amidst the most impenetrable darkness that thoughts and ideas again came to george campbell of how many momentsor yearsor eternitieshad elapsed since his flight through the grey void he could form no estimate he knew only that he seemed to be at rest and without pain indeed the absence of all physical sensation was the salient quality of his condition it made even the blackness seem less solidly blacksuggesting as it did that he was rather a disembodied intelligence in a state beyond physical senses than a corporeal being with senses deprived of their accustomed objects of perception he could think sharply and quicklyalmost preternaturally soyet could form no idea whatsoever of his situationhalf by instinct he realised that he was not in his own tent true he might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world equally black yet he knew this was not so there was no camp cot beneath himhe had no hands to feel the blankets and canvas surface and flashlight that ought to be around himthere was no sensation of cold in the airno flap through which he could glimpse the pale night outside something was wrong dreadfully wronghe cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube which had hypnotised himof that and all which had followed he had known that his mind was going yet had been unable to draw back at the last moment there had been a shocking panic feara subconscious fear beyond even that caused by the sensation of daemonic flight it had come from some vague flash or remote recollectionjust what he could not at once tell some cellgroup in the back of his head had seemed to find a cloudily familiar quality in the cubeand that familiarity was fraught with dim terror now he tried to remember what the familiarity and the terror werelittle by little it came to him oncelong ago in connection with his geological lifeworkhe had read of something like that cube it had to do with those debatable and disquieting clay fragments called the eltdown shards dug up from precarboniferous strata in southern england thirty years before their shape and markings were so queer that a few scholars hinted at artificiality and made wild conjectures about them and their origin they came clearly from a time when no human beings could exist on the globebut their contours and figurings were damnably puzzling that was how they got their nameit was not however in the writings of any sober scientist that campbell had seen that reference to a crystal discholding globe the source was far less reputable and infinitely more vivid about 1912 a deeply learned sussex clergyman of occultist leaningsthe reverend arthur brooke wintershallhad professed to identify the markings on the eltdown shards with some of the socalled prehuman hieroglyphs persistently cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical circles and had published at his own expense what purported to be a translation of the primal and baffling inscriptionsa translation still quoted frequently and seriously by occult writers in this translationa surprisingly long brochure in view of the limited number of shards existinghad occurred the narrative supposedly of prehuman authorship containing the now frightening referenceas the story went there dwelt on a worldand eventually on countless other worldsof outer space a mighty order of wormlike beings whose attainments and whose control of nature surpassed anything within the range of terrestrial imagination they had mastered the art of interstellar travel early in their career and had peopled every habitable planet in their own galaxykilling off the races they foundbeyond the limits of their own galaxywhich was not oursthey could not navigate in person but in their quest for knowledge of all space and time they discovered a means of spanning certain transgalactic gulfs with their minds they devised peculiar objectsstrangely energized cubes of a curious crystal containing hypnotic talismen and enclosed in spaceresisting spherical envelopes of an unknown substancewhich could be forcibly expelled beyond the limits of their universe and which would respond to the attraction of cool solid matter onlythese of which a few would necessarily land on various inhabited worlds in outside universes formed the etherbridges needed for mental communication atmospheric friction burned away the protecting envelope leaving the cube exposed and subject to discovery by the intelligent minds of the world where it fell by its very nature the cube would attract and rivet attention this when coupled with the action of light was sufficient to set its special properties workingthe mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the power of the disc and would be

cube was attuned the captured mind would remain suspended without body or senses until examined by one of the dominant race then it would by an obscure process of interchange be pumped of all its contents the investigators mind would now occupy the strange machine while the captive mind occupied the interrogators wormlike body then in another interchange the interrogators mind would leap across boundless space to the captives vacant and unconscious body on the transgalactic worldanimating the alien tenement as best it might and exploring the alien world in the guise of one of its denizenswhen done with exploration the adventurer would use the cube and its disc in accomplishing his returnand sometimes the captured mind would be restored safely to its own remote world not always however was the dominant race so kind sometimes when a potentially important race capable of space travel was found the wormlike folk would employ the cube to capture and annihilate minds by the thousands and would extirpate the race for diplomatic reasonsusing the exploring minds as agents of destructionin other cases sections of the wormfolk would permanently occupy a transgalactic planetdestroying the captured minds and wiping out the remaining inhabitants preparatory to settling down in unfamiliar bodies never however could the parent civilization be quite duplicated in such a case since the new planet would not contain all the materials necessary for the wormraces arts the cubes for example could be made only on the home planetonly a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a landing and response on an inhabited worldsince there was no such thing asaimingthem at goals beyond sight or knowledge only three ran the story had ever landed on peopled worlds in our own particular universe one of these had struck a planet near the galactic rim two thousand billion years ago while another had lodged three billion years ago on a world near the centre of the galaxy the thirdand the only one ever known to have invaded the solar systemhad reached our own earth 150000000 years agoit was with this latter that dr wintershalls translation chiefly dealt when the cube struck the earth he wrote the ruling terrestrial species was a huge coneshaped race surpassing all others before or since in mentality and achievements this race was so advanced that it had actually sent minds abroad in both space and time to explore the cosmos hence recognised something of what had happened when the cube fell from the sky and certain individuals had suffered mental change after gazing at itrealising that the changed individuals represented invading minds the races leaders had them destroyedeven at the cost of leaving the displaced minds exiled in alien space they had had experience with even stranger transitions when through a mental exploration of space and time they formed a rough idea of what the cube was they carefully hid the thing from light and sight and guarded it as a menace they did not wish to destroy a thing so rich in later experimental possibilities now and then some rash unscrupulous adventurer would furtively gain access to it and sample its perilous powers despite the consequencesbut all such cases were discovered and safely and drastically dealt withof this evil meddling the only bad result was that the wormlike outside race learned from the new exiles what had happened to their explorers on earth and conceived a violent hatred of the planet and all its lifeforms they would have depopulated it if they could and indeed sent additional cubes into space in the wild hope of striking it by accident in unguarded placesbut that accident never came to passthe coneshaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube in a special shrine as a relique and basis for experiments till after aeons it was lost amidst the chaos of war and the destruction of the great polar city where it was guarded when fifty million years ago the beings sent their minds ahead into the infinite future to avoid a nameless peril of inner earth the whereabouts of the sinister cube from space were unknownthis much according to the learned occultist the eltdown shards had said what now made the account so obscurely frightful to campbell was the minute accuracy with which the alien cube had been described every detail tallieddimensions consistency hieroglyphed central disc hypnotic effects as he thought the matter over and over amidst the darkness of his strange situation he began to wonder whether his whole experience with the crystal cubeindeed its very existencewere not a nightmare brought on by some freakish subconscious memory of this old bit of extravagant charlatanic reading if so though the nightmare must still be in force since his present apparently bodiless state had nothing of normality in itof the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection campbell could form no estimate everything about his state was so unreal that ordinary dimensions and measurements became meaningless it seemed an eternity but perhaps it was not really long before the sudden interruption came what happened was as strange and inexplicable as the blackness it succeeded there was a sensationof the mind rather than of the bodyand all at once campbell felt his thoughts swept or sucked beyond his control in tumultuous and chaotic fashionmemories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly all that he knewall his personal background traditions experiences scholarship dreams ideas and inspirationswelled up abruptly and simultaneously with a dizzying speed and abundance which soon made him unable to keep track of any separate concept the parade of all his mental contents became an avalanche a cascade a vortex it was as horrible and vertiginous as his hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him finally it sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh oblivionanother measureless blankand then a slow trickle of sensation this time it was physical not mental sapphire light and a low rumble of distant sound there were tactile impressionshe could realise that he was lying at full length on something though there was a baffling strangeness about the feel of his posture he could not reconcile the pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlinesor with the outlines of the human form at all he tried to move his arms but found no definite response to the attempt instead there were little ineffectual nervous twitches all over the area which seemed to mark his bodyhe tried to open his eyes more widely but found himself unable to control their mechanism the sapphire light came in a diffused nebulous manner and could nowhere be voluntarily focussed into definiteness gradually though visual images began to trickle in curiously and indecisively the limits and qualities of vision were not those which he was used to but he could roughly correlate the sensation with what he had known as sight as this sensation gained some degree of stability campbell realised that he must still be in the throes of nightmarehe seemed to be in a room of considerable extentof medium height but with a large proportionate area on every sideand he could apparently see all four sides at oncewere high narrowish slits which seemed to serve as combined doors and windows there were singular low tables or pedestals but no furniture of normal nature and proportions through the slits streamed floods of sapphire light and beyond them could be mistily seen the sides and roofs of fantastic buildings like clustered cubes on the wallsin the vertical panels between the slitswere strange markings of an oddly disquieting character it was some time before campbell understood why they disturbed him sothen he saw that they were in repeated instances precisely like some of the hieroglyphs on the crystal cubes discthe actual nightmare element though was something more than this it began with the living thing which presently entered through one of the slits advancing deliberately toward him and bearing a metal box of bizarre proportions and glassy mirrorlike surfaces for this thing was nothing humannothing of earthnothing even of mans myths and dreams it was a gigantic palegrey worm or centipede as large around as a man and twice as long with a disclike apparently eyeless ciliafringed head bearing a purple central orifice it glided on its rear pairs of legs with its fore part raised verticallythe legs or at least two pairs of them serving as arms along its spinal ridge was a curious purple comb and a fanshaped tail of some grey membrane ended its grotesque bulk there was a ring of flexible red spikes around its neck and from the twistings of these came clicking twanging sounds in measured deliberate rhythmshere indeed was outr nightmare at its heightcapricious fantasy at its apex but even this vision of delirium was not what caused george campbell to lapse a third time into unconsciousness it took one more thingone final unbearable touchto do that as the nameless worm advanced with its glistening box the reclining man caught in the mirrorlike surface a glimpse of what should have been his own body yethorribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar sensationsit was not his own body at all that he saw reflected in the burnished metal it was instead the loathsome palegrey bulk of one of the great centipedesrobert e howardfrom that final lap of senselessness he emerged with a full understanding of his situation his mind was imprisoned in the body of a frightful native of an alien planet while somewhere on the other side of the universe his own body was housing the monsters personalityhe fought down an unreasoning horror judged from a cosmic standpoint why should his metamorphosis horrify him life and consciousness were the only realities in the universe form was unimportant his present body was hideous only according to terrestrial standards fear and revulsion were drowned in the excitement of titanic adventurewhat was his former body but a cloak eventually to be cast off at death anyway he had no sentimental illusions about the life from which he had been exiled what had it ever given him save toil poverty continual frustration and repression if this life before him offered no more at least it offered no less intuition told him it offered moremuch morewith the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its naked fundamentals he realized that he remembered with pleasure only the physical delights of his former life but he had long ago exhausted all the physical possibilities contained in that earthly body earth held no new thrills but in the possession of this new alien body he felt promises of strange exotic joysa lawless exultation rose in him he was a man without a world free of all conventions or inhibitions of earth or of this strange planet free of every artificial restraint in the universe he was a god with grim amusement he thought of his body moving in earths business and society with all the while an alien monster staring out of the windows that were george campbells eyes on people who would flee if they knewlet him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would earth and its races no longer had any meaning to george campbell there he had been one of a billion nonentities fixed in place by a mountainous accumulation of conventions laws and manners doomed to live and die in his sordid niche but in one blind bound he had soared above the commonplace this was not death but rebirththe birth of a fullgrown mentality with a newfound freedom that made little of physical captivity on yekubhe started yekub it was the name of this planet but how had he known then he knew as he knew the name of him whose body he occupiedtothe memory deep grooved in tothes brain was stirring in himshadows of the knowledge tothe had carved deep in the physical tissues of the brain they spoke dimly as implanted instincts to george campbell and his human consciousness seized them and translated them to show him the way not only to safety and freedom but to the power his soul stripped to its primitive impulses craved not as a slave would he dwell on yekub but as a king just as of old barbarians had sat on the throne of lordly empiresfor the first time he turned his attention to his surroundings he still lay on the couchlike thing in the midst of that fantastic room and the centipede man stood before him holding the polished metal object and clashing its neckspikes thus it spoke to him campbell knew and what it said he dimly understood through the implanted thought processes of tothe just as he knew the creature was yukth supreme lord of sciencebut campbell gave no heed for he had made his desperate plan a plan so alien to the ways of yekub that it was beyond yukths comprehension and caught him wholly unprepared yukth like campbell saw the sharppointed metal shard on a nearby table but to yukth it was only a scientific implement he did not even know it could be used as a weapon campbells earthly mind supplied the knowledge and the action that followed driving tothes body into movements no man of yekub had ever made beforecampbell snatched the pointed shard and struck ripping savagely upward yukth reared and toppled his entrails spilling on the floor in an instant campbell was streaking for a door his speed was amazing exhilarating first fulfillment of the promise of novel physical sensationsas he ran guided wholly by the instinctive knowledge implanted in tothes physical reflexes it was as if he were borne by a separate consciousness in his legs tothes body was bearing him along a route it had traversed ten thousand times when animated by tothes minddown a winding corridor he raced up a twisted stair through a carved door and the same instincts that had brought him there told him he had found what he sought he was in a circular room with a domed roof from which shone a livid blue light a strange structure rose in the middle of the rainbowhued floor tier on tier each of a separate vivid color the ultimate tier was a purple cone from the apex of which a blue smoky mist drifted upward to a sphere that poised in midaira sphere that shone like translucent ivorythis the deepgrooved memories of tothe told campbell was the god of yekub though why the people of yekub feared and worshipped it had been forgotten a million years a wormpriest stood between him and the altar which no hand of flesh had ever touched that it could be touched was a blasphemy that had never occurred to a man of yekub the wormpriest stood in frozen horror until campbells shard ripped the life out of himon his centipedelegs campbell clambered the tiered altar heedless of its sudden quiverings heedless of the change that was taking place in the floating sphere heedless of the smoke that now billowed out in blue clouds he was drunk with the feel of power he feared the superstitions of yekub no more than he feared those of earth with that globe in his hands he would be king of yekub the worm men would dare deny him nothing when he held their god as hostage he reached a hand for the ballno longer ivoryhued but red as blood frank belknap longout of the tent into the pale august night walked the body of george campbell it moved with a slow wavering gait between the bodies of enormous trees over a forest path strewed with sweet scented pine needles the air was crisp and cold the sky was an inverted bowl of frosted silver flecked with stardust and far to the north the aurora borealis splashed streamers of firethe head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to side from the corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of amber froth which fluttered in the night breeze he walked upright at first as a man would walk but gradually as the tent receded his posture altered his torso began almost imperceptibly to slant and his limbs to shortenin a faroff world of outer space the centipede creature that was george campbell clasped to its bosom a god whose lineaments were red as blood and ran with insectlike quiverings across a rainbowhued hall and out through massive portals into the bright glow of alien sunsweaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that suggested the awkward loping of a werebeast the body of george campbell was fulfilling a mindless destiny long clawtipped fingers dragged leaves from a carpet of odorous pine needles as it moved toward a wide expanse of gleaming waterin the faroff extragalactic world of the worm people george campbell moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry down long fernplanted avenues holding aloft the round red godthere was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the gleaming lake on earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in a body swayed by instinct human teeth sank into soft animal fur tore at black animal flesh a little silver fox sank its fangs in frantic retaliation into a furry human wrist and thrashed about in terror as its blood spurted slowly the body of george campbell arose its mouth splashed with fresh blood with upper limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of the lakeas the variform creature that was george campbell crawled between the black blocks of stone thousands of wormshapes prostrated themselves in the scintillating dust before it a godlike power seemed to emanate from its weaving body as it moved with a slow undulant motion toward a throne of spiritual empire transcending all the sovereignties of eartha trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth near the tent where the wormcreature dwelt in the body of george campbell came to the gleaming waters of the lake and discerned something dark floating there he had been lost in the woods all night and weariness enveloped him like a leaden cloak in the pale morning lightbut the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore moving to the edge of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out toward the floating bulk slowly he pulled it to the shorefar off in outer space the wormcreature holding the glowing red god ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation cassiopeia under an alien vault of hypersuns the great deity that he held aloft energized his worm tenement burning away in the white fire of a supermundane spirituality all animal drosson earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the blackened and hairy face of the drowned man it was a bestial face repulsively anthropoid in

slime from which it sprangthus spoke the round red god of yekub in a faroff segment of the spacetime continuum to george campbell as the latter with all human desire purged away sat on a throne and ruled an empire of worms more wisely kindly and benevolently than any man of earth had ever ruled an empire of men,1

west of arkham the hills rise wild and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut there are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight on the gentler slopes there are farms ancient and rocky with squat mosscoated cottages brooding eternally over old new england secrets in the lee of great ledges but these are all vacant now the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofsthe old folk have gone away and foreigners do not like to live there frenchcanadians have tried it italians have tried it and the poles have come and departed it is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled but because of something that is imagined the place is not good for the imagination and does not bring restful dreams at night it must be this which keeps the foreigners away for old ammi pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days ammi whose head has been a little queer for years is the only one who still remains or who ever talks of the strange days and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around arkhamthere was once a road over the hills and through the valleys that ran straight where the blasted heath is now but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun and the secrets of the strange days will be one with the deeps secrets one with the hidden lore of old ocean and all the mystery of primal earthwhen i went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me the place was evil they told me this in arkham and because that is a very old town full of witch legends i thought the evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through centuries the name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and theatrical and i wondered how it had come into the folklore of a puritan people then i saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for myself and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own elder mystery it was morning when i saw it but shadow lurked always there the trees grew too thickly and their trunks were too big for any healthy new england wood there was too much silence in the dim alleys between them and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decayin the open spaces mostly along the line of the old road there were little hillside farms sometimes with all the buildings standing sometimes with only one or two and sometimes with only a lone chimney or fastfilling cellar weeds and briers reigned and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth upon everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression a touch of the unreal and the grotesque as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry i did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay for this was no region to sleep in it was too much like a landscape of salvator rosa too much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terrorbut even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath i knew it the moment i came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley for no other name could fit such a thing or any other thing fit such a name it was as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one particular region it must i thought as i viewed it be the outcome of a fire but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields it lay largely to the north of the ancient road line but encroached a little on the other side i felt an odd reluctance about approaching and did so at last only because my business took me through and past it there was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse but only a fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about the trees near it were sickly and stunted and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim as i walked hurriedly by i saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney and cellar on my right and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight even the long dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast and i marvelled no more at the frightened whispers of arkham people there had been no house or ruin near even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote and at twilight dreading to repass that ominous spot i walked circuitously back to the town by the curving road on the south i vaguely wished some clouds would gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soulin the evening i asked old people in arkham about the blasted heath and what was meant by that phrase strange days which so many evasively muttered i could not however get any good answers except that all the mystery was much more recent than i had dreamed it was not a matter of old legendry at all but something within the lifetime of those who spoke it had happened in the eighties and a family had disappeared or was killed speakers would not be exact and because they all told me to pay no attention to old ammi pierces crazy tales i sought him out the next morning having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick it was a fearsomely archaic place and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long only with persistent knocking could i rouse the aged man and when he shuffled timidly to the door i could tell he was not glad to see me he was not so feeble as i had expected but his eyes drooped in a curious way and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales i feigned a matter of business told him of my surveying and asked vague questions about the district he was far brighter and more educated than i had been led to think and before i knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man i had talked with in arkham he was not like other rustics i had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be from him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake relief was all that he shewed relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life they were better under water nowbetter under water since the strange days and with this opening his husky voice sank low while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressivelyit was then that i heard the story and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on i shivered again and again despite the summer day often i had to recall the speaker from ramblings piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors talk or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity broke down when he was done i did not wonder that his mind had snapped a trifle or that the folk of arkham would not speak much of the blasted heath i hurried back before sunset to my hotel unwilling to have the stars come out above me in the open and the next day returned to boston to give up my position i could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones the reservoir will soon be built now and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms but even then i do not believe i would like to visit that country by nightat least not when the sinister stars are out and nothing could bribe me to drink the new city water of arkhamit all began old ammi said with the meteorite before that time there had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials and even then these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in the miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone altar older than the indians these were not haunted woods and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days then there had come that white noontide cloud that string of explosions in the air and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood and by night all arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the nahum gardner place that was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to comethe trim white nahum gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchardsnahum had come to town to tell people about the stone and had dropped in at ammi pierces on the way ammi was forty then and all the queer things were fixed very strongly in his mind he and his wife had gone with the three professors from miskatonic university who hastened out the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space and had wondered why nahum had called it so large the day before it had shrunk nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic wellsweep in his front yard but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink its heat lingered persistently and nahum declared it had glowed faintly in the night the professors tried it with a geologists hammer and found it was oddly soft it was in truth so soft as to be almost plastic and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing they took it in an old pail borrowed from nahums kitchen for even the small piece refused to grow cool on the trip back they stopped at ammis to rest and seemed thoughtful when mrs pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the bottom of the pail truly it was not large but perhaps they had taken less than they thoughtthe day after thatall this was in june of 82the professors had trooped out again in a great excitement as they passed ammis they told him what queer things the specimen had done and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker the beaker had gone too and the wise men talked of the strange stones affinity for silicon it had acted quite unbelievably in that wellordered laboratory doing nothing at all and shewing no occluded gases when heated on charcoal being wholly negative in the borax bead and soon proving itself absolutely nonvolatile at any producible temperature including that of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe on an anvil it appeared highly malleable and in the dark its luminosity was very marked stubbornly refusing to grow cool it soon had the college in a state of real excitement and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements bizarre optical properties and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by the unknownhot as it was they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents water did nothing hydrochloric acid was the same nitric acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things but recognised some solvents as i mentioned them in the usual order of use there were ammonia and caustic soda alcohol and ether nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others but although the weight grew steadily less as time passed and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling there was no change in the solvents to shew that they had attacked the substance at all it was a metal though beyond a doubt it was magnetic for one thing and after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the widmannsttten figures found on meteoric iron when the cooling had grown very considerable the testing was carried on in glass and it was in a glass beaker that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work the next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace and only a charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had beenall this the professors told ammi as they paused at his door and once more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars though this time his wife did not accompany him it had now most certainly shrunk and even the sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw all around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space except where the earth had caved in and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before it was now scarcely five it was still hot and the sages studied its surface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel they gouged deeply this time and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite homogeneousthey had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule imbedded in the substance the colour which resembled some of the bands in the meteors strange spectrum was almost impossible to describe and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all its texture was glossy and upon tapping it appeared to promise both brittleness and hollowness one of the professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer and it burst with a nervous little pop nothing was emitted and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing it left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across and all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing substance wasted awayconjecture was vain so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling the seekers left again with their new specimenwhich proved however as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor had been aside from being almost plastic having heat magnetism and slight luminosity cooling slightly in powerful acids possessing an unknown spectrum wasting away in air and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result it presented no identifying features whatsoever and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it it was nothing of this earth but a piece of the great outside and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside lawsthat night there was a thunderstorm and when the professors went out to nahums the next day they met with a bitter disappointment the stone magnetic as it had been must have had some peculiar electrical property for it had drawn the lightning as nahum said with a singular persistence six times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient wellsweep halfchoked with cavedin earth digging had borne no fruit and the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment the failure was total so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead that fragment lasted a week at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it when it had gone no residue was left behind and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside that lone weird message from other universes and other realms of matter force and entityas was natural the arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate sponsoring and sent reporters to talk with nahum gardner and his family at least one boston daily also sent a scribe and nahum quickly became a kind of local celebrity he was a lean genial person of about fifty living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley he and ammi exchanged visits frequently as did their wives and ammi had nothing but praise for him after all these years he seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had attracted and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks that july and august were hot and nahum worked hard at his haying in the tenacre pasture across chapmans brook his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between the labour tired him more than it had in other years and he felt that age was beginning to tell on himthen fell the time of fruit and harvest the pears and apples slowly ripened and nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before the fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop but with the ripening came sore disappointment for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness so that even the smallest of bites induced a lasting disgust it was the same with the melons and tomatoes and nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost quick to connect events he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot along the roadwinter came early and was very cold ammi saw nahum less often than usual and observed that he had begun to look worried the rest of his family too seemed to have grown taciturn and were far from steady in their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside for this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet nahum himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain footprints in the snow they were the usual winter prints of red squirrels white rabbits and foxes but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement he was never specific but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past nahums house in his sleigh on the way back from clarks corners there had been a moon and a rabbit had run across the road and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either ammi or his horse liked the latter indeed had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein thereafter ammi gave nahums tales more respect and wondered why the gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every morning they had it developed nearly lost the spirit to barkin february the mcgregor boys from meadow hill were out shooting woodchucks and not far from the gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen the proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before the boys were genuinely frightened and threw the thing away at once so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside but the shying of the horses near nahums house had now become an acknowledged thing and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was fast taking formpeople vowed that the snow melted faster around nahums than it did anywhere else and early in march there was an awed discussion in potters general store at clarks corners stephen rice had driven past gardners in the morning and had noticed the skunkcabbages coming up through the mud by the woods across the road never were things of such size seen before and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words their shapes were monstrous and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck stephen as wholly unprecedented that afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world the bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned and it went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in nahums ground of course it was the meteorite and remembering how strange the men from the college had found that stone to be several farmers spoke about the matter to themone day they paid nahum a visit but having no love of wild tales and folklore were very conservative in what they inferred the plants were certainly odd but all skunkcabbages are more or less odd in shape and odour and hue perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the soil but it would soon be washed away and as for the footprints and frightened horsesof course this was mere country talk which such a phenomenon as the arolite would be certain to start there was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip for superstitious rustics will say and believe anything and so all through the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt only one of them when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a year and a half later recalled that the queer colour of that skunkcabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light shewn by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope and like the brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss the samples in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first though later they lost the propertythe trees budded prematurely around nahums and at night they swayed ominously in the wind nahums second son thaddeus a lad of fifteen swore that they swayed also when there was no wind but even the gossips would not credit this certainly however restlessness was in the air the entire gardner family developed the habit of stealthy listening though not for any sound which they could consciously name the listening was indeed rather a product of moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away unfortunately such moments increased week by week till it became common speech that something was wrong with all nahums folks when the early saxifrage came out it had another strange colour not quite like that of the skunkcabbage but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it nahum took some blossoms to arkham and shewed them to the editor of thegazettebut that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule it was a mistake of nahums to tell a stolid city man about the way the great overgrown mourningcloak butterflies behaved in connexion with these saxifragesapril brought a kind of madness to the country folk and began that disuse of the road past nahums which led to its ultimate abandonment it was the vegetation all the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region no sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth the dutchmans breeches became a thing of sinister menace and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion ammi and the gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor nahum ploughed and sowed the tenacre pasture and the upland lot but did nothing with the land around the house he knew it would be of no use and hoped that the summers strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil he was prepared for almost anything now and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard the shunning of his house by neighbours told on him of course but it told on his wife more the boys were better off being at school each day but they could not help being frightened by the gossip thaddeus an especially sensitive youth suffered the mostin may the insects came and nahums place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience the gardners took to watching at nightwatching in all directions at random for something they could not tell what it was then that they all owned that thaddeus had been right about the trees mrs gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky the boughs surely moved and there was no wind it must be the sap strangeness had come into everything growing now yet it was none of nahums family at all who made the next discovery familiarity had dulled them and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends what he told in arkham was given a short paragraph in thegazetteand it was there that all the farmers nahum included saw it first the night had been dark and the buggylamps faint but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be nahums the darkness had been less thick a dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation grass leaves and blossoms alike while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barnthe grass had so far seemed untouched and the cows were freely pastured in the lot near the house but toward the end of may the milk began to be bad then nahum had the cows driven to the uplands after which the trouble ceased not long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye all the verdure was going grey and was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place and his visits were becoming fewer and fewer when school closed the gardners were virtually cut off from the world and sometimes let ammi do their errands in town they were failing curiously both physically and mentally and no one was surprised when the news of mrs gardners madness stole aroundit happened in june about the anniversary of the meteors fall and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe in her raving there was not a single specific noun but only verbs and pronouns things moved and changed and fluttered and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds something was taken awayshe was being drained of somethingsomething was fastening itself on her that ought not to besomeone must make it keep offnothing was ever still in the nightthe walls and windows shifted nahum did not send her to the county asylum but let her wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and others even when her expression changed he did nothing but when the boys grew afraid of her and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him he decided to keep her locked in the attic by july she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours and before that month was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the dark as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetationit was a little before this that the horses had stampeded something had aroused them in the night and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible there seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them and when nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer it took a week to track all four and when found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable something had snapped in their brains and each one had to be shot for its own good nahum borrowed a horse from ammi for his haying but found it would not approach the barn it shied balked and whinnied and in the end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching and all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were greying now and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless the asters and goldenrod bloomed grey and distorted and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such blasphemouslooking things that nahums oldest boy zenas cut them down the strangely puffed insects died about that time even the bees that had left their hives and taken to the woodsby september all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder and nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil his wife now had spells of terrific screaming and he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension they shunned people now and when school opened the boys did not go but it was ammi on one of his rare visits who first realised that the well water was no longer good it had an evil taste that was not exactly foetid nor exactly salty and ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again nahum however ignored the warning for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant things he and the boys continued to use the tainted supply drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and illcooked meals and did their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days there was something of stolid resignation about them all as if they walked half in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doomthaddeus went mad in september after a visit to the well he had gone with a pail and had come back emptyhanded shrieking and waving his arms and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about the moving colours down there two in one family was pretty bad but nahum was very brave about it he let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and hurting himself and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his mothers the way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible especially to little merwin who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was not of earth merwin was getting frightfully imaginative and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the brother who had been his greatest playmatealmost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced poultry turned greyish and died very quickly their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting hogs grew inordinately fat then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain their meat was of course useless and nahum was at his wits end no rural veterinary would approach his place and the city veterinary from arkham was openly baffled the swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died and their eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations it was very inexplicable for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation then something struck the cows certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common in the last stagesand death was always the resultthere would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs there could be no question of poison for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn no bites of prowling things could have brought the virus for what live beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles it must be only natural diseaseyet what disease could wreak such results was beyond any minds guessing when the harvest came there was not an animal surviving on the place for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away these dogs three in number had all vanished one night and were never heard of again the five cats had left some time before but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no mice and only mrs gardner had made pets of the graceful felineson the nineteenth of october nahum staggered into ammis house with hideous news the death had come to poor thaddeus in his attic room and it had come in a way which could not be told nahum had dug a grave in the railed family plot behind the farm and had put therein what he found there could have been nothing from outside for the small barred window and locked door were intact but it was much as it had been in the barn ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they could but shuddered as they did so stark terror seemed to cling round the gardners and all they touched and the very presence of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable ammi accompanied nahum home with the greatest reluctance and did what he might to calm the hysterical sobbing of little merwin zenas needed no calming he had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him and ammi thought that his fate was very merciful now and then merwins screams were answered faintly from the attic and in response to an inquiring look nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble when night approached ammi managed to get away for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind it was really lucky for ammi that he was not more imaginative even as things were his mind was bent ever so slightly but had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac in the twilight he hastened home the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his earsthree days later nahum lurched into ammis kitchen in the early morning and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more while mrs pierce listened in a clutching fright it was little merwin this time he was gone he had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water and had never come back hed been going to pieces for days and hardly knew what he was about screamed at everything there had been a frantic shriek from the yard then but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone there was no glow from the lantern he had taken and of the child himself no trace at the time nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too but when dawn came and the man had plodded back from his allnight search of the woods and fields he had found some very curious things near the well there was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern while a bent bail and twisted iron hoops beside it both halffused seemed to hint at the remnants of the pail that was all nahum was past imagining mrs pierce was blank and ammi when he had reached home and heard the tale could give no guess merwin was gone and there would be no use in telling the people around who shunned all gardners now no use either in telling the city people at arkham who laughed at everything thad was gone and now merwin was gone something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard nahum would go soon and he wanted ammi to look after his wife and zenas if they survived him it must all be a judgment of some sort though he could not fancy what for since he had always walked uprightly in the lords ways so far as he knewfor over two weeks ammi saw nothing of nahum and then worried about what might have happened he overcame his fears and paid the gardner place a visit there was no smoke from the great chimney and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst the aspect of the whole farm was shockinggreyish withered grass and leaves on the ground vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables and great bare trees clawing up at the grey november sky with a studied malevolence which ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches but nahum was alive after all he was weak and lying on a couch in the lowceiled kitchen but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to zenas the room was deadly cold and as ammi visibly shivered the host shouted huskily to zenas for more wood wood indeed was sorely needed since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney presently nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable and then ammi saw what had happened the stoutest cord had broken at last and the hapless farmers mind was proof against more sorrowquestioning tactfully ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing zenas in the wellhe lives in the well was all that the clouded father would say then there flashed across the visitors mind a sudden thought of the mad wife and he changed his line of inquiry nabby why here she is was the surprised response of poor nahum and ammi soon saw that he must search for himself leaving the harmless babbler on the couch he took the keys from their nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic it was very close and noisome up there and no sound could be heard from any direction of the four doors in sight only one was locked and on this he tried various keys on the ring he had taken the third key proved the right one and after some fumbling ammi threw open the low white doorit was quite dark inside for the window was small and halfobscured by the crude wooden bars and ammi could see nothing at all on the wideplanked floor the stench was beyond enduring and before proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air when he did enter he saw something dark in the corner and upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright while he screamed he thought a momentary cloud eclipsed the window and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some hateful current of vapour strange colours danced before his eyes and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor that the geologists hammer had shattered and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring as it was he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young thaddeus and the livestock but the terrible thing about this horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumbleammi would give me no added particulars to this scene but the shape in the corner does not reappear in his tale as a moving object there are things which cannot be mentioned and what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law i gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic room and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment anyone but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad but ammi walked conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him there would be nahum to deal with now he must be fed and tended and removed to some place where he could be cared forcommencing his descent of the dark stairs ammi heard a thud below him he even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off and recalled nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above what presence had his cry and entry started up halted by some vague fear he heard still further sounds below indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction with an associative sense goaded to feverish heights he thought unaccountably of what he had seen upstairs good god what eldritch dreamworld was this into which he had blundered he dared move neither backward nor forward but stood there trembling at the black curve of the boxedin staircase every trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain the sounds the sense of dread expectancy the darkness the steepness of the narrow stepsand merciful heaven the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight steps sides exposed laths and beams alikethen there burst forth a frantic whinny from ammis horse outside followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway in another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them but that was not all there had been another sound out there a sort of liquid splashwaterit must have been the well he had left hero untied near it and a buggywheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a stone and still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably ancient woodwork god how old the house was most of it built before 1670 and the gambrel roof not later than 1730a feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly and ammis grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose slowly nerving himself he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the kitchen but he did not complete the walk because what he sought was no longer there it had come to meet him and it was still alive after a fashion whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external force ammi could not say but the death had been at it everything had happened in the last halfhour but collapse greying and disintegration were already far advanced there was a horrible brittleness and dry fragments were scaling off ammi could not touch it but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that had been a face what was it nahumwhat was it he whispered and the cleft bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answernothin nothin the colour it burns cold an wet but it burns it lived in the well i seen it a kind o smoke jest like the flowers last spring the well shone at night thad an mernie an zenas everything alive suckin the life out of everything in that stone it must a come in that stone pizened the whole place dunt know what it wants that round thing them men from the college dug outen the stone they smashed it it was that same colour jest the same like the flowers an plants must a ben more of em seeds seeds they growed i seen it the fust time this week must a got strong on zenas he was a big boy full o life it beats down your mind an then gits ye burns ye up in the well water you was right about that evil water zenas never come back from the well cant git away draws ye ye know summats comin but taint no use i seen it time an agin senct zenas was took whars nabby ammi my heads no good dunt know how long senct i fed her itll git her ef we aint keerful jest a colour her face is gettin to hev that colour sometimes towards night an it burns an sucks it come from some place whar things aint as they is here one o them professors said so he was right look out ammi itll do suthin more sucks the life out but that was all that which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and reeled out the back door into the fields he climbed the slope to the tenacre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods he could not pass that well from which his horse had run away he had looked at it through the window and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim then the lurching buggy had not dislodged anything after allthe splash had been something elsesomething which went into the well after it had done with poor nahum when ammi reached his house the horse and buggy had arrived before him and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety reassuring her without explanations he set out at once for arkham and notified the authorities that the gardner family was no more he indulged in no details but merely told of the deaths of nahum and nabby that of thaddeus being already known and mentioned that the cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock he also stated that merwin and zenas had disappeared there was considerable questioning at the police station and in the end ammi was compelled to take three officers to the gardner farm together with the coroner the medical examiner and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals he went much against his will for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place but it was some comfort to have so many people with himthe six men drove out in a democratwagon following ammis buggy and arrived at the pestridden farmhouse about four oclock used as the officers were to gruesome experiences not one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below the whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough but those two crumbling objects were beyond all bounds no one could look long at them and even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine specimens could be analysed of course so he busied himself in obtaining themand here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken under the spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum in which many of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in the previous year the property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonatesammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant to do anything then and there it was getting toward sunset and he was anxious to be away but he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the great sweep and when a detective questioned him he admitted that nahum had feared something down thereso much so that he had never even thought of searching it for merwin or zenas after that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well immediately so ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside the men sniffed in disgust at the fluid and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were uncovering it was not so long a job as they had feared it would be since the water was phenomenally low there is no need to speak too exactly of what they found merwin and zenas were both there in part though the vestiges were mainly skeletal there were also a small deer and a large dog in about the same state and a number of bones of smaller animals the ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling and a man who descended on handholds with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstructiontwilight had now fallen and lanterns were brought from the house then when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sittingroom while the intermittent light of a spectral halfmoon played wanly on the grey desolation outside the men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case and could find no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions the unknown disease of livestock and humans and the unaccountable deaths of merwin and zenas in the tainted well they had heard the common country talk it is true but could not believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred no doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter was it the well water very possibly it might be a good idea to analyse it but what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well their deeds were so similarand the fragments shewed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death why was everything so grey and brittleit was the coroner seated near a window overlooking the yard who first noticed the glow about the well night had fully set in and all the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams but this new glow was something definite and distinct and appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where the water had been emptied it had a very queer colour and as all the men clustered round the window ammi gave a violent start for this strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue he had seen that colour before and feared to think what it might mean he had seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that arolite two summers ago had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime and had thought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had happened it had flashed there a second and a clammy and hateful current of vapour had brushed past himand then poor nahum had been taken by something of that colour he had said so at the lastsaid it was the globule and the plants after that had come the runaway in the yard and the splash in the welland now that well was belching forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same daemoniac tintit does credit to the alertness of ammis mind that he puzzled even at that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific he could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime against a window opening on the morning sky and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape it wasnt rightit was against natureand he thought of those terrible last words of his stricken friend it come from some place whar things aint as they is here one o them professors said so all three horses outside tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road were now neighing and pawing frantically the wagon driver started for the door to do something but ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder dunt go out thar he whispered theys more to this nor what we know nahum said somethin lived in the well that sucks your life out he said it must be someat growed from a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago june sucks an burns he said an is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now that ye can hardly see an cant tell what it is nahum thought it feeds on everything livin an gits stronger all the time he said he seen it this last week it must be somethin from away off in the sky like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was the way its made an the way it works aint like no way o gods world its someat from beyondso the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy it was truly an awful moment with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself four monstrous sets of fragmentstwo from the house and two from the wellin the woodshed behind and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front ammi had restrained the driver on impulse forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did no one will ever know what was abroad that night and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind there is no telling what it might not have done at that last moment and with its seemingly increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the halfclouded moonlit skyall at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short sharp gasp the others looked at him and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested there was no need for words what had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on that the strange days are never talked about in arkham it is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening one did arise not long afterward but there was absolutely none then even the dry tips of the lingering hedgemustard grey and blighted and the fringe on the roof of the standing democratwagon were unstirred and yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving they were twitching morbidly and spasmodically clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black rootsnot a man breathed for several seconds then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily at this there was a general cry muffled with awe but husky and almost identical from every throat for the terror had not faded with the silhouette and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance tipping each bough like the fire of st elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles heads at pentecost it was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light like a glutted swarm of corpsefed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which ammi had come to recognise and dread all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form it was no longershiningout it waspouringout and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the skythe veterinary shivered and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it ammi shook no less and had to tug and point for lack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees the neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward with the moments the shining of the trees increased while their restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality the wood of the wellsweep was shining now and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds and beehives near the stone wall on the west they were commencing to shine too though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road and as ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realised that the span of frantic greys had broke their sapling and run off with the democratwagonthe shock served to loosen several tongues and embarrassed whispers were exchanged it spreads on everything organic thats been around here muttered the medical examiner no one replied but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible it was awful he added there was no bottom at all just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there ammis horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the road outside and nearly drowned its owners faint quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections it come from that stone it growed down thar it got everything livin it fed itself on em mind and body thad an mernie zenas an nabby nahum was the last they all drunk the water it got strong on em it come from beyond whar things aint like they be here now its goin home at this point as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator later described differently there came from poor tethered hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a horse every person in that lowpitched sitting room stopped his ears and ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea words could not convey itwhen ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy that was the last of hero till they buried him next day but the present was no time to mourn for almost at this instant a detective silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them in the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment it glowed on the broadplanked floor and the fragment of rag carpet and shimmered over the sashes of the smallpaned windows it ran up and down the exposed cornerposts coruscated about the shelf and mantel and infected the very doors and furniture each minute saw it strengthen and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that houseammi shewed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the tenacre pasture they walked and stumbled as in a dream and did not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground they were glad of the path for they could not have gone the front way by that well it was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled fiendish contours but thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up the moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge over chapmans brook and it was blind groping from there to the open meadowswhen they looked back toward the valley and the distant gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight all the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour trees buildings and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness the boughs were all straining skyward tipped with tongues of foul flame and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house barn and sheds it was a scene from a vision of fuseli and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the wellseething feeling lapping reaching scintillating straining and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticismthen without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out no watcher can ever forget that sight and ammi stared blankly at the stars of cygnus deneb twinkling above the others where the unknown colour had melted into the milky way but his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley it was just that only a wooden ripping and crackling and not an explosion as so many others of the party vowed yet the outcome was the same for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance blurring the glance of the few who saw it and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown through quickly reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished and in another second they had vanished too behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black frore gusts from interstellar space it shrieked and howled and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy till soon the trembling party realised it would be no use waiting for the moon to shew what was left down there at nahumstoo awed even to hint theories the seven shaking men trudged back toward arkham by the north road ammi was worse than his fellows and begged them to see him inside his own kitchen instead of keeping straight on to town he did not wish to cross the nighted windwhipped woods alone to his home on the main road for he had had an added shock that the others were spared and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come as the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set their faces toward the road ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his illstarred friend and from that stricken faraway spot he had seen something feebly rise only to sink down again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the sky it was just a colourbut not any colour of our earth or heavens and because ammi recognised that colour and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down there in the well he has never been quite right sinceammi would never go near the place again it is over half a century now since the horror happened but he has never been there and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out i shall be glad too for i do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well i passed i hope the water will always be very deepbut even so i shall never drink it i do not think i shall visit the arkham country hereafter three of the men who had been with ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight but there were not any real ruins only the bricks of the chimney the stones of the cellar some mineral and metallic litter here and there and the rim of that nefandous well save for ammis dead horse which they towed away and buried and the buggy which they shortly returned to him everything that had ever been living had gone five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained nor has anything ever grown there since to this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it the blasted heaththe rural tales are queer they might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyse the water from that disused well or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to disperse botanists too ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreadinglittle by little perhaps an inch a year people say the colour of the neighbouring herbage is not quite right in the spring and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere horsesthe few that are left in this motor agegrow skittish in the silent valley and hunters cannot depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dustthey say the mental influences are very bad too numbers went queer in the years after nahums taking and always they lacked the power to get away then the strongerminded folk all left the region and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads they could not stay though and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild weird stores of whispered magic have given them their dreams at night they protest are very horrible in that grotesque country and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy no traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye i myself am curious about the sensation i derived from my one lone walk before ammi told me his tale when twilight came i had vaguely wished some clouds would gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my souldo not ask me for my opinion i do not knowthat is all there was no one but ammi to question for arkham people will not talk about the strange days and all three professors who saw the arolite and its coloured globule are dead there were other globulesdepend upon that one must have fed itself and escaped and probably there was another which was too late no doubt it is still down the welli know there was something wrong with the sunlight i saw above that miasmal brink the rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now but whatever daemon hatchling is there it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air one of the current arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at nightwhat it is only god knows in terms of matter i suppose the thing ammi described would be called a gas but this gas obeyed laws that are not of our cosmos this was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories this was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure it was just a colour out of spacea frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all nature as we know it from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extracosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyesi doubt very much if ammi consciously lied to me and i do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor and something terriblethough i know not in what proportionstill remains i shall be glad to see the water come meanwhile i hope nothing will happen to ammi he saw so much of the thingand its influence was so insidious why has he never been able to move away how clearly he recalled those dying words of nahumscant git away draws ye ye know summats comin but taint no use ammi is such a good old manwhen the reservoir gang gets to work i must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him i would hate to think of him as the grey twisted brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep,1
you ask me to explain why i am afraid of a draught of cool air why i shiver more than others upon entering a cold room and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day there are those who say i respond to cold as others do to a bad odour and i am the last to deny the impression what i will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance i ever encountered and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarityit is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness silence and solitude i found it in the glare of midafternoon in the clangour of a metropolis and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace roominghouse with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side in the spring of 1923 i had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of new york and being unable to pay any substantial rent began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness endurable furnishings and very reasonable price it soon developed that i had only a choice between different evils but after a time i came upon a house in west fourteenth street which disgusted me much less than the others i had sampledthe place was a fourstory mansion of brownstone dating apparently from the late forties and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence in the rooms large and lofty and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery but the floors were clean the linen tolerably regular and the hot water not too often cold or turned off so that i came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again the landlady a slatternly almost bearded spanish woman named herrero did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the lateburning electric light in my thirdfloor front hall room and my fellowlodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire being mostly spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyancei had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred one evening at about eight i heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that i had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time looking about i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street anxious to stop the matter at its source i hastened to the basement to tell the landlady and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set rightdoctair muoz she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me he have speel hees chemicals he ees too seeck for doctair heemselfseecker and seecker all the timebut he weel not have no othair for help he ees vairy queer in hees seecknessall day he take funneesmelling baths and he cannot get excite or warm all hees own housework he dohees leetle room are full of bottles and machines and he do not work as doctair but he was great oncemy fathair in barcelona have hear of heemand only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get hurt of sudden he nevair go out only on roof and my boy esteban he breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals my gawd the salammoniac that man use for keep heem coolmrs herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor and i returned to my room the ammonia ceased to drip and as i cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air i heard the landladys heavy footsteps above me dr muoz i had never heard save for certain sounds as of some gasolinedriven mechanism since his step was soft and gentle i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity there is i reflected tritely an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come down in the worldi might never have known dr muoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room physicians had told me of the danger of those spells and i knew there was no time to be lost so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalids help of the injured workman i dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine my knock was answered in good english by a curious voice some distance to the right asking my name and business and these things being stated there came an opening of the door next to the one i had soughta rush of cool air greeted me and though the day was one of the hottest of late june i shivered as i crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness a folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa and the mahogany furniture sumptuous hangings old paintings and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentlemans study rather than a boardinghouse bedroom i now saw that the hall room above minethe leetle room of bottles and machines which mrs herrero had mentionedwas merely the laboratory of the doctor and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices dr muoz most certainly was a man of birth cultivation and discriminationthe figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit a highbred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short irongrey full beard and an oldfashioned pincenez shielded the full dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly celtiberian thick welltrimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breedingnevertheless as i saw dr muoz in that blast of cool air i felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling and even these things should have been excusable considering the mans known invalidism it might too have been the singular cold that alienated me for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day and the abnormal always excites aversion distrust and fearbut repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration for the strange physicians extreme skill at once became manifest despite the icecoldness and shakiness of his bloodlesslooking hands he clearly understood my needs at a glance and ministered to them with a masters deftness the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room evidently he found the society of a wellborn man a rare novelty in this dingy environment and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over himhis voice if queer was at least soothing and i could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out he sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his theories and experiments and i remember his tactfully consoling me about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself so that if a bodily frame be but originally healthy and carefully preserved it may through a scientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the most serious impairments defects or even absences in the battery of specific organs he might he half jestingly said some day teach me to liveor at least to possess some kind of conscious existencewithout any heart at all for his part he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold any marked rise in temperature might if prolonged affect him fatally and the frigidity of his habitationsome 55 or 56 degrees fahrenheitwas maintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling the gasoline engine of whose pumps i had often heard in my own room belowrelieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse after that i paid him frequent overcoated calls listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly results and trembling a bit when i examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves i was eventually i may add almost cured of my disease for all time by his skilful ministrations it seems that he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists since he believed these cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled i was touched by his account of the aged dr torres of valencia who had shared his earlier experiments with him through the great illness of eighteen years before whence his present disorders proceeded no sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought perhaps the strain had been too great for dr muoz made it whisperingly clearthough not in detailthat the methods of healing had been most extraordinary involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative galensas the weeks passed i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically as mrs herrero had suggested the livid aspect of his countenance was intensified his voice became more hollow and indistinct his muscular motions were less perfectly cordinated and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion i had originally felthe developed strange caprices acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a sepulchred pharaoh in the valley of kings at the same time his demands for cold air increased and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34 or 40 and finally even 28 the bathroom and laboratory of course being less chilled in order that water might not freeze and that chemical processes might not be impeded the tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the connecting door so i helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty a kind of growing horror of outr and morbid cast seemed to possess him he talked of death incessantly but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggestedall in all he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose i likewise did much of his shopping and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply housesan increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment the whole house as i have said had a musty odour but the smell in his room was worseand in spite of all the spices and incense and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided i perceived that it must be connected with his ailment and shuddered when i reflected on what that ailment might be mrs herrero crossed herself when she looked at him and gave him up unreservedly to me not even letting her son esteban continue to run errands for him when i suggested other physicians the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain he evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned and he refused to be confined to his bed the lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the deathdaemon even as that ancient enemy seized him the pretence of eating always curiously like a formality with him he virtually abandoned and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total collapsehe acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that i transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he namedfor the most part lettered east indians but including a once celebrated french physician now generally thought dead and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered as it happened i burned all these papers undelivered and unopened his aspect and voice became utterly frightful and his presence almost unbearable one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight that man oddly enough had been through the terrors of the great war without having incurred any fright so thoroughthen in the middle of october the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness one night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible dr muoz summoned me by thumping on the floor and i worked desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless rattling hollowness surpassed description my amateur efforts however proved of no use and when i had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring allnight garage we learned that nothing could be done till morning when a new piston would have to be obtained the moribund hermits rage and fear swelling to grotesque proportions seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom he groped his way out with face tightly bandaged and i never saw his eyes againthe frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing and at about 5 am the doctor retired to the bathroom commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice i could obtain at allnight drug stores and cafeterias as i would return from my sometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door i could hear a restless splashing within and a thick voice croaking out the order for moremore at length a warm day broke and the shops opened one by one i asked esteban either to help with the icefetching whilst i obtained the pump piston or to order the piston while i continued with the ice but instructed by his mother he absolutely refusedfinally i hired a seedylooking loafer whom i encountered on the corner of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where i introduced him and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it the task seemed interminable and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless foodless round of vain telephoning and a hectic quest from place to place hither and thither by subway and surface car about noon i encountered a suitable supply house far downtown and at approximately 130 pm arrived at my boardingplace with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics i had done all i could and hoped i was in timeblack terror however had preceded me the house was in utter turmoil and above the chatter of awed voices i heard a man praying in a deep basso fiendish things were in the air and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctors closed door the lounger i had hired it seems had fled screaming and madeyed not long after his second delivery of ice perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity he could not of course have locked the door behind him yet it was now fastened presumably from the inside there was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow thick drippingbriefly consulting with mrs herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul i advised the breaking down of the door but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device we had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall and flung all the windows to the very top now noses protected by handkerchiefs we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoona kind of dark slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door and thence to the desk where a terrible little pool had accumulated something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterablywhat was or had been on the couch i cannot and dare not say here but this is what i shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before i drew a match and burned it to a crisp what i puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station the nauseous words seemed wellnigh incredible in that yellow sunlight with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending clamorously from crowded fourteenth street yet i confess that i believed them then whether i believe them now i honestly do not know there are things about which it is better not to speculate and all that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool airthe end ran that noisome scrawl is here no more icethe man looked and ran away warmer every minute and the tissues cant last i fancy you knowwhat i said about the will and the nerves and the preserved body after the organs ceased to work it was good theory but couldnt keep up indefinitely there was a gradual deterioration i had not foreseen dr torres knew but the shock killed him he couldnt stand what he had to dohe had to get me in a strange dark place when he minded my letter and nursed me back and the organs never would work again it had to be done my wayartificial preservationfor you see i died that time eighteen years ago,1
of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written the ecstasies and horrors of de quincey and theparadis artificielsof baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them immortal and the world knows well the beauty the terror and the mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is transported but much as has been told no man has yet dared intimate thenatureof the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind or hint at thedirectionof the unheardof roads along whose ornate and exotic course the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne de quincey was drawn back into asia that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous antiquity is so impressive that the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual but farther than that he dared not go those whohavegone farther seldom returned and even when they have they have been either silent or quite mad i took opium but oncein the year of the plague when doctors sought to deaden the agonies they could not cure there was an overdosemy physician was worn out with horror and exertionand i travelled very far indeed in the end i returned and lived but my nights are filled with strange memories nor have i ever permitted a doctor to give me opium againthe pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the drug was administered of the future i had no heed to escape whether by cure unconsciousness or death was all that concerned me i was partly delirious so that it is hard to place the exact moment of transition but i think the effect must have begun shortly before the pounding ceased to be painful as i have said there was an overdose so my reactions were probably far from normal the sensation of falling curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction was paramount though there was a subsidiary impression of unseen throngs in incalculable profusion throngs of infinitely diverse nature but all more or less related to me sometimes it seemed less as though i were falling than as though the universe or the ages were falling past me suddenly my pain ceased and i began to associate the pounding with an external rather than internal force the falling had ceased also giving place to a sensation of uneasy temporary rest and when i listened closely i fancied the pounding was that of the vast inscrutable sea as its sinister colossal breakers lacerated some desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude then i opened my eyesfor a moment my surroundings seemed confused like a projected image hopelessly out of focus but gradually i realised my solitary presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows of the exact nature of the apartment i could form no idea for my thoughts were still far from settled but i noticed varicoloured rugs and draperies elaborately fashioned tables chairs ottomans and divans and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the exotic without being actually alien these things i noticed yet they were not long uppermost in my mind slowly but inexorably crawling upon my consciousness and rising above every other impression came a dizzying fear of the unknown a fear all the greater because i could not analyse it and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menacenot death but some nameless unheardof thing inexpressibly more ghastly and abhorrentpresently i realised that the direct symbol and excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain it seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which i stood and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images i felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the silkhung walls and shrank from glancing through the arched latticed windows that opened so bewilderingly on every hand perceiving shutters attached to these windows i closed them all averting my eyes from the exterior as i did so then employing a flint and steel which i found on one of the small tables i lit the many candles reposing about the walls in arabesque sconces the added sense of security brought by closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree but i could not shut out the monotonous pounding now that i was calmer the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful and i felt a contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful shrinking opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the pounding i beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a carven door and large oriel window to this window i was irresistibly drawn though my illdefined apprehensions seemed almost equally bent on holding me back as i approached it i could see a chaotic whirl of waters in the distance then as i attained it and glanced out on all sides the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with full and devastating forcei beheld such a sight as i had never beheld before and which no living person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of opium the building stood on a narrow point of landor what wasnowa narrow point of landfully 300 feet above what must lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters on either side of the house there fell a newly washedout precipice of red earth whilst ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully eating away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation out a mile or more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in height and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures the waves were dark and purplish almost black and clutched at the yielding red mud of the bank as if with uncouth greedy hands i could not but feel that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon all the solid ground perhaps abetted by the angry skyrecovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural spectacle had thrown me i realised that my actual physical danger was acute even whilst i gazed the bank had lost many feet and it could not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit of lashing waves accordingly i hastened to the opposite side of the edifice and finding a door emerged at once locking it after me with a curious key which had hung inside i now beheld more of the strange region about me and marked a singular division which seemed to exist in the hostile ocean and firmament on each side of the jutting promontory different conditions held sway at my left as i faced inland was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in under a brightly shining sun something about that suns nature and position made me shudder but i could not then tell and cannot tell now what it was at my right also was the sea but it was blue calm and only gently undulating while the sky above it was darker and the washedout bank more nearly white than reddishi now turned my attention to the land and found occasion for fresh surprise for the vegetation resembled nothing i had ever seen or read about it was apparently tropical or at least subtropicala conclusion borne out by the intense heat of the air sometimes i thought i could trace strange analogies with the flora of my native land fancying that the wellknown plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical change of climate but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were plainly foreign the house i had just left was very smallhardly more than a cottagebut its material was evidently marble and its architecture was weird and composite involving a quaint fusion of western and eastern forms at the corners were corinthian columns but the red tile roof was like that of a chinese pagoda from the door inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand about four feet wide and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable flowering shrubs and plants it lay toward the side of the promontory where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish down this path i felt impelled to flee as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the pounding ocean at first it was slightly uphill then i reached a gentle crest behind me i saw the scene i had left the entire point with the cottage and the black water with the green sea on one side and the blue sea on the other and a curse unnamed and unnamable lowering over all i never saw it again and often wonder after this last look i strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before methe path as i have intimated ran along the righthand shore as one went inland ahead and to the left i now viewed a magnificent valley comprising thousands of acres and covered with a swaying growth of tropical grass higher than my head almost at the limit of vision was a colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me by this time wonder and escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely dissipated my fear but as i paused and sank fatigued to the path idly digging with my hands into the warm whitishgolden sand a new and acute sense of danger seized me some terror in the swishing tall grass seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea and i started up crying aloud and disjointedly tiger tiger is it tiger beast beast is it a beast that i am afraid of my mind wandered back to an ancient and classical story of tigers which i had read i strove to recall the author but had difficulty then in the midst of my fear i remembered that the tale was by rudyard kipling nor did the grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me i wished for the volume containing this story and had almost started back toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the lure of the palm prevented mewhether or not i could have resisted the backward beckoning without the counterfascination of the vast palm tree i do not know this attraction was now dominant and i left the path and crawled on hands and knees down the valleys slope despite my fear of the grass and of the serpents it might contain i resolved to fight for life and reason as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land though i sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant breakers i would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for relief but could never quite shut out the detestable sound it was as it seemed to me only after ages that i finally dragged myself to the beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shadethere now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror incidents which i tremble to recall and dare not seek to interpret no sooner had i crawled beneath the overhanging foliage of the palm than there dropped from its branches a young child of such beauty as i never beheld before though ragged and dusty this being bore the features of a faun or demigod and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the tree it smiled and extended its hand but before i could arise and speak i heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing notes high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness the sun had by this time sunk below the horizon and in the twilight i saw that an aureola of lambent light encircled the childs head then in a tone of silver it addressed me it is the end they have come down through the gloaming from the stars now all is over and beyond the arinurian streams we shall dwell blissfully in teloe as the child spoke i beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree and rising greeted a pair whom i knew to be the chief singers among those i had heard a god and goddess they must have been for such beauty is not mortal and they took my hands saying come child you have heard the voices and all is well in teloe beyond the milky way and the arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony and upon their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful stars under the ivory bridges of teloe flow rivers of liquid gold bearing pleasurebarges bound for blossomy cytharion of the seven suns and in teloe and cytharion abide only youth beauty and pleasure nor are any sounds heard save of laughter song and the lute only the gods dwell in teloe of the golden rivers but among them shalt thou dwellas i listened enchanted i suddenly became aware of a change in my surroundings the palm tree so lately overshadowing my exhausted form was now some distance to my left and considerably below me i was obviously floating in the atmosphere companioned not only by the strange child and the radiant pair but by a constantly increasing throng of halfluminous vinecrowned youths and maidens with windblown hair and joyful countenance we slowly ascended together as if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from the golden nebulae and the child whispered in my ear that i must look always upward to the pathways of light and never backward to the sphere i had just left the youths and maidens now chaunted mellifluous choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes and i felt enveloped in a peace and happiness more profound than any i had in life imagined when the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my soul through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists as if in mocking daemoniac concord throbbed from gulfs below the damnable the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean and as those black breakers beat their message into my ears i forgot the words of the child and looked back down upon the doomed scene from which i thought i had escapeddown through the aether i saw the accursed earth turning ever turning with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted cities and under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights i can never describe sights i can never forget deserts of corpselike clay and jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains and villages of my native land and maelstroms of frothing ocean where once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers around the northern pole steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours hissing before the onslaught of the evermounting waves that curled and fretted from the shuddering deep then a rending report clave the night and athwart the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift still the black ocean foamed and gnawed eating away the desert on either side as the rift in the centre widened and widenedthere was now no land left but the desert and still the fuming ocean ate and ate all at once i thought even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something afraid of dark gods of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters but even if it was it could not turn back and the desert had suffered too much from those nightmare waves to help them now so the ocean ate the last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf thereby giving up all it had ever conquered from the newflooded lands it flowed again uncovering death and decay and from its ancient and immemorial bed it trickled loathsomely uncovering nighted secrets of the years when time was young and the gods unborn above the waves rose weedy remembered spires the moon laid pale lilies of light on dead london and paris stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with stardust then rose spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered terrible spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were landsthere was not any pounding now but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of waters tumbling into the rift the smoke of that rift had changed to steam and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser it seared my face and hands and when i looked to see how it affected my companions i found they had all disappeared then very suddenly it ended and i knew no more till i awaked upon a bed of convalescence as the cloud of steam from the plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire surface from my sight all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether in one delirious flash and burst it happened one blinding deafening holocaust of fire smoke and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to the voidand when the smoke cleared away and i sought to look upon the earth i beheld against the background of cold humorous stars only the dying sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister,1
in 1925 i went into oklahoma looking for snake lore and i came out with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life i admit it is foolish since there are natural explanations for everything i saw and heard but it masters me none the less if the old story had been all there was to it i would not have been so badly shaken my work as an american indian ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of extravagant legendry and i know that simple white people can beat the redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions but i cant forget what i saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in guthriei called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me i would find something important there neither indians nor white men would discuss the snakegod legends i had come to trace the oilboom newcomers of course knew nothing of such matters and the red men and old pioneers were plainly frightened when i spoke of them not more than six or seven people mentioned the asylum and those who did were careful to talk in whispers but the whisperers said that dr mcneill could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all i wanted to know he could explain why yig the halfhuman father of serpents is a shunned and feared object in central oklahoma and why old settlers shiver at the secret indian orgies which make the autumn days and nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tomtoms in lonely placesit was with the scent of a hound on the trail that i went to guthrie for i had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of serpentworship among the indians i had always felt from welldefined undertones of legend and archaeology that great quetzalcoatlbenign snakegod of the mexicanshad had an older and darker prototype and during recent months i had wellnigh proved it in a series of researches stretching from guatemala to the oklahoma plains but everything was tantalising and incomplete for above the border the cult of the snake was hedged about by fear and furtivenessnow it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to dawn and i sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness i did not try to cloak dr mcneill was a small cleanshaven man of somewhat advanced years and i saw at once from his speech and manner that he was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his profession grave and doubtful when i first made known my errand his face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the letter of introduction which a kindly old exindian agent had given meso youve been studying the yig legend eh he reflected sententiously i know that many of our oklahoma ethnologists have tried to connect it with quetzalcoatl but i dont think any of them have traced the intermediate steps so well youve done remarkable work for a man as young as you seem to be and you certainly deserve all the data we can givei dont suppose old major moore or any of the others told you what it is i have here they dont like to talk about it and neither do i it is very tragic and very horrible but that is all i refuse to consider it anything supernatural theres a story about it that ill tell you after you see ita devilish sad story but one that i wont call magic it merely shews the potency that belief has over some people ill admit there are times when i feel a shiver thats more than physical but in daylight i set all that down to nerves im not a young fellow any more alasto come to the point the thing i have is what you might call a victim of yigs cursea physically living victim we dont let the bulk of the nurses see it although most of them know its here there are just two steady old chaps whom i let feed it and clean out its quartersused to be three but good old stevens passed on a few years ago i suppose ill have to break in a new group pretty soon for the thing doesnt seem to age or change much and we old boys cant last forever maybe the ethics of the near future will let us give it a merciful release but its hard to telldid you see that single groundglass basement window over in the east wing when you came up the drive thats where it is ill take you there myself now you neednt make any comment just look through the moveable panel in the door and thank god the light isnt any stronger then ill tell you the storyor as much as ive been able to piece togetherwe walked downstairs very quietly and did not talk as we threaded the corridors of the seemingly deserted basement dr mcneill unlocked a greypainted steel door but it was only a bulkhead leading to a further stretch of hallway at length he paused before a door marked b 116 opened a small observation panel which he could use only by standing on tiptoe and pounded several times upon the painted metal as if to arouse the occupant whatever it might bea faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it and i fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low hissing response finally he motioned me to replace him at the peephole and i did so with a causeless and increasing tremor the barred groundglass window close to the earth outside admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor and i had to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before i could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the strawcovered floor emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss then the shadowed outlines began to take shape and i perceived that the squirming entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat on its belly i clutched at the doorhandle for support as i tried to keep from faintingthe moving object was almost of human size and entirely devoid of clothing it was absolutely hairless and its tawnylooking back seemed subtly squamous in the dim ghoulish light around the shoulders it was rather speckled and brownish and the head was very curiously flat as it looked up to hiss at me i saw that the beady little black eyes were damnably anthropoid but i could not bear to study them long they fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence so that i closed the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in its matted straw and spectral twilight i must have reeled a bit for i saw that the doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away i was stuttering over and over again bbut for gods sakewhat is itdr mcneill told me the story in his private office as i sprawled opposite him in an easychair the gold and crimson of late afternoon changed to the violet of early dusk but still i sat awed and motionless i resented every ring of the telephone and every whir of the buzzer and i could have cursed the nurses and internes whose knocks now and then summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office night came and i was glad my host switched on all the lights scientist though i was my zeal for research was half forgotten amidst such breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when whispered witchtales go the rounds of the chimneycornerit seems that yig the snakegod of the central plains tribespresumably the primal source of the more southerly quetzalcoatl or kukulcanwas an odd halfanthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary and capricious nature he was not wholly evil and was usually quite welldisposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his children the serpents but in the autumn he became abnormally ravenous and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites that was why the tomtoms in the pawnee wichita and caddo country pounded ceaselessly week in and week out in august september and october and why the medicinemen made strange noises with rattles and whistles curiously like those of the aztecs and mayasyigs chief trait was a relentless devotion to his childrena devotion so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region frightful clandestine tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked harm upon his wriggling progeny his chosen method being to turn his victim after suitable tortures to a spotted snakein the old days of the indian territory the doctor went on there was not quite so much secrecy about yig the plains tribes less cautious than the desert nomads and pueblos talked quite freely of their legends and autumn ceremonies with the first indian agents and let considerable of the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of white settlement the great fear came in the landrush days of 89 when some extraordinary incidents had been rumoured and the rumours sustained by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs indians said that the new white men did not know how to get on with yig and afterward the settlers came to take that theory at face value now no oldtimer in middle oklahoma white or red could be induced to breathe a word about the snakegod except in vague hints yet after all the doctor added with almost needless emphasis the only truly authenticated horror had been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of bewitchment it was all very material and crueleven that last phase which had caused so much disputedr mcneill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his special story and i felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre curtain rises the thing had begun when walker davis and his wife audrey left arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the spring of 1889 and the end had come in the country of the wichitasnorth of the wichita river in what is at present caddo county there is a small village called binger there now and the railway goes through but otherwise the place is less changed than other parts of oklahoma it is still a section of farms and ranchesquite productive in these dayssince the great oilfields do not come very closewalker and audrey had come from franklin county in the ozarks with a canvastopped wagon two mules an ancient and useless dog called wolf and all their household goods they were typical hillfolk youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most and looked forward to a life of better returns for their hard work than they had had in arkansas both were lean rawboned specimens the man tall sandy and greyeyed and the woman short and rather dark with a black straightness of hair suggesting a slight indian admixturein general there was very little of distinction about them and but for one thing their annals might not have differed from those of thousands of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that time that thing was walkers almost epileptic fear of snakes which some laid to prenatal causes and some said came from a dark prophecy about his end with which an old indian squaw had tried to scare him when he was small whatever the cause the effect was marked indeed for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake would cause him to grow faint and pale while the sight of even a tiny specimen would produce a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion seizurethe davises started out early in the year in the hope of being on their new land for the spring ploughing travel was slow for the roads were bad in arkansas while in the territory there were great stretches of rolling hills and red sandy barrens without any roads whatever as the terrain grew flatter the change from their native mountains depressed them more perhaps than they realised but they found the people at the indian agencies very affable while most of the settled indians seemed friendly and civil now and then they encountered a fellowpioneer with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable rivalry were generally exchangedowing to the season there were not many snakes in evidence so walker did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness in the earlier stages of the journey too there were no indian snakelegends to trouble him for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours as fate would have it it was a white man at okmulgee in the creek country who gave the davises the first hint of yig beliefs a hint which had a curiously fascinating effect on walker and caused him to ask questions very freely after thatbefore long walkers fascination had developed into a bad case of fright he took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the nightly camps always clearing away whatever vegetation he found and avoiding stony places whenever he could every clump of stunted bushes and every cleft in the great slablike rocks seemed to him now to hide malevolent serpents while every human figure not obviously part of a settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snakegod till nearness had proved the contrary fortunately no troublesome encounters came at this stage to shake his nerves still furtheras they approached the kickapoo country they found it harder and harder to avoid camping near rocks finally it was no longer possible and poor walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some of the rustic antisnake charms he had learned in his boyhood two or three times a snake was really glimpsed and these sights did not help the sufferer in his efforts to preserve composureon the twentysecond evening of the journey a savage wind made it imperative for the sake of the mules to camp in as sheltered a spot as possible and audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former tributary of the canadian river he did not like the rocky cast of the place but allowed himself to be overruled this once leading the animals sullenly toward the protecting slope which the nature of the ground would not allow the wagon to approachaudrey examining the rocks near the wagon meanwhile noticed a singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog seizing a rifle she followed his lead and presently thanked her stars that she had forestalled walker in her discovery for there snugly nested in the gap between two boulders was a sight it would have done him no good to see visible only as one convoluted expanse but perhaps comprising as many as three or four separate units was a mass of lazy wriggling which could not be other than a brood of newborn rattlesnakesanxious to save walker from a trying shock audrey did not hesitate to act but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down again and again upon the writhing objects her own sense of loathing was great but it did not amount to a real fear finally she saw that her task was done and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the red sand and dry dead grass near by she must she reflected cover the nest up before walker got back from tethering the mules old wolf tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was had vanished and she feared he had gone to fetch his masterfootsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded a second more and walker had seen everything audrey made a move to catch him if he should faint but he did no more than sway then the look of pure fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled awe and anger and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tonesgawds sake aud but whyd ye go for to do that haint ye heerd all the things theyve been tellin about this snakedevil yig yed ought to a told me and wed a moved on dont ye know theys a devilgod what gets even if ye hurts his children what for dye think the injuns all dances and beats their drums in the fall about this lands under a curse i tell yenigh every soul weve atalked to sence we come ins said the same yig rules here an he comes out every fall for to git his victims and turn em into snakes why aud they wont none of them

offen some o the injun medicinemen hell git ye aud as sures theys a gawd in heavenhell come outa the night and turn ye into a crawlin spotted snakeall the rest of the journey walker kept up the frightened reproofs and prophecies they crossed the canadian near newcastle and soon afterward met with the first of the real plains indians they had seena party of blanketed wichitas whose leader talked freely under the spell of the whiskey offered him and taught poor walker a longwinded protective charm against yig in exchange for a quart bottle of the same inspiring fluid by the end of the week the chosen site in the wichita country was reached and the davises made haste to trace their boundaries and perform the spring ploughing before even beginning the construction of a cabinthe region was flat drearily windy and sparse of natural vegetation but promised great fertility under cultivation occasional outcroppings of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone and here and there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground like a manmade floor there seemed to be a very few snakes or possible dens for them so audrey at last persuaded walker to build the oneroom cabin over a vast smooth slab of exposed stone with such a flooring and with a goodsized fireplace the wettest weather might be defiedthough it soon became evident that dampness was no salient quality of the district logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest belt of woods many miles toward the wichita mountainswalker built his widechimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of some of the other settlers though the nearest one was over a mile away in turn he helped his helpers at similar houseraisings so that many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours there was no town worthy the name nearer than el reno on the railway thirty miles or more to the northeast and before many weeks had passed the people of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of their scattering the indians a few of whom had begun to settle down on ranches were for the most part harmless though somewhat quarrelsome when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to them despite all government bansof all the neighbours the davises found joe and sally compton who likewise hailed from arkansas the most helpful and congenial sally is still alive known now as grandma compton and her son clyde then an infant in arms has become one of the leading men of the state sally and audrey used to visit each other often for their cabins were only two miles apart and in the long spring and summer afternoons they exchanged many a tale of old arkansas and many a rumour about the new countrysally was very sympathetic about walkers weakness regarding snakes but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness which audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying and prophesying about the curse of yig she was uncommonly full of gruesome snake stories and produced a direfully strong impression with her acknowledged masterpiecethe tale of a man in scott county who had been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once and had swelled so monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop needless to say audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband and she implored the comptons to beware of starting it on the rounds of the countryside it is to joes and sallys credit that they heeded this plea with the utmost fidelitywalker did his cornplanting early and in midsummer improved his time by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region with the help of joe compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of very good water though he planned to sink an artesian later on he did not run into many serious snake scares and made his land as inhospitable as possible for wriggling visitors every now and then he rode over to the cluster of thatched conical huts which formed the main village of the wichitas and talked long with the old men and shamans about the snakegod and how to nullify his wrath charms were always ready in exchange for whiskey but much of the information he got was far from reassuringyig was a great god he was bad medicine he did not forget things in the autumn his children were hungry and wild and yig was hungry and wild too all the tribes made medicine against yig when the corn harvest came they gave him some corn and danced in proper regalia to the sound of whistle rattle and drum they kept the drums pounding to drive yig away and called down the aid of tirwa whose children men are even as the snakes are yigs children it was bad that the squaw of davis killed the children of yig let davis say the charms many times when the corn harvest comes yig is yig yig is a great godby the time the corn harvest did come walker had succeeded in getting his wife into a deplorably jumpy state his prayers and borrowed incantations came to be a nuisance and when the autumn rites of the indians began there was always a distant windborne pounding of tomtoms to lend an added background of the sinister it was maddening to have the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains why would it never stop day and night week on week it was always going in exhaustless relays as persistently as the red dusty winds that carried it audrey loathed it more than her husband did for he saw in it a compensating element of protection it was with this sense of a mighty intangible bulwark against evil that he got in his corn crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winterthe autumn was abnormally warm and except for their primitive cookery the davises found scant use for the stone fireplace walker had built with such care something in the unnaturalness of the hot dustclouds preyed on the nerves of all the settlers but most of all on audreys and walkers the notions of a hovering snakecurse and the weird endless rhythm of the distant indian drums formed a bad combination which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly unendurablenotwithstanding this strain several festive gatherings were held at one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped keeping naively alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvesthome which are as old as human agriculture itself lafayette smith who came from southern missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of walkers was a very passable fiddler and his tunes did much to make the celebrants forget the monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms then halloween drew near and the settlers planned another frolicthis time had they but known it of a lineage older than even agriculture the dread witchsabbath of the primal prearyans kept alive through ages in the midnight blackness of secret woods and still hinting at vague terrors under its latterday mask of comedy and lightness halloween was to fall on a thursday and the neighbours agreed to gather for their first revel at the davis cabinit was on that thirtyfirst of october that the warm spell broke the morning was grey and leaden and by noon the incessant winds had changed from searingness to rawness people shivered all the more because they were not prepared for the chill and walker davis old dog wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth but the distant drums still thumped on nor were the white citizenry less inclined to pursue their chosen rites as early as four in the afternoon the wagons began to arrive at walkers cabin and in the evening after a memorable barbecue lafayette smiths fiddle inspired a very fairsized company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in the one goodsized but crowded room the younger folk indulged in the amiable inanities proper to the season and now and then old wolf would howl with doleful and spinetickling ominousness at some especially spectral strain from lafayettes squeaky violina device he had never heard before mostly though this battered veteran slept through the merriment for he was past the age of active interests and lived largely in his dreams tom and jennie rigby had brought their collie zeke along but the canines did not fraternise zeke seemed strangely uneasy over something and nosed around curiously all the eveningaudrey and walker made a fine couple on the floor and grandma compton still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night their worries seemed forgotten for the nonce and walker was shaved and trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness by ten oclock all hands were healthily tired and the guests began to depart family by family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time everybody had had tom and jennie thought zekes eerie howls as he followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go home though audrey said it must be the faraway tomtoms which annoyed him for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment withinthe night was bitterly cold and for the first time walker put a great log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering till morning old wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed into his customary coma audrey and walker too tired to think of charms or curses tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep before the cheap alarmclock on the mantel had ticked out three minutes and from far away the rhythmic pounding of those hellish tomtoms still pulsed on the chill nightwinddr mcneill paused here and removed his glasses as if a blurring of the objective world might make the reminiscent vision cleareryoull soon appreciate he said that i had a great deal of difficulty in piecing out all that happened after the guests left there were times thoughat firstwhen i was able to make a try at it after a moment of silence he went on with the taleaudrey had terrible dreams of yig who appeared to her in the guise of satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen it was indeed from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake to find walker already conscious and sitting up in bed he seemed to be listening intently to something and silenced her with a whisper when she began to ask what had roused himhark aud he breathed dont ye hear somethin asingin and buzzin and rustlin dye reckon its the fall cricketscertainly there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound as he had described audrey tried to analyse it and was impressed with some element at once horrible and familiar which hovered just outside the rim of her memory and beyond it all waking a hideous thought the monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms came incessantly across the black plains on which a cloudy halfmoon had setwalkerspose itsthethecurse o yigshe could feel him trembleno gal i dont reckon he comes that away hes shapen like a man except ye look at him clost thats what chief grey eagle says this heres some varmints come in outen the coldnot crickets i calclate but summat like em id orter git up and stomp em out afore they make much headway or git at the cupboardhe rose felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach and rattled the tin matchbox nailed to the wall beside it audrey sat up in bed and watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the lantern then as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek for the flat rocky floor revealed in the newborn illumination was one seething brownspeckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes slithering toward the fire and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace the frightblasted lanternbearerit was only for an instant that audrey saw the things the reptiles were of every size of uncountable numbers and apparently of several varieties and even as she looked two or three of them reared their heads as if to strike at walker she did not faintit was walkers crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into blackness he had not screamed a second timefright had paralysed him and he fell as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortals bow to audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically mingling with the nightmare from which she had startedvoluntary motion of any sort was impossible for will and the sense of reality had left her she fell back inertly on her pillow hoping that she would wake soon no actual sense of what had happened penetrated her mind for some time then little by little the suspicion that she was really awake began to dawn on her and she was convulsed with a mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mutewalker was gone and she had not been able to help him he had died of snakes just as the old witchwoman had predicted when he was a little boy poor wolf had not been able to help eitherprobably he had not even awaked from his senile stupor and now the crawling things must be coming for her writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing up over the coarse woollen blankets unconsciously she crept under the clothes and trembledit must be the curse of yig he had sent his monstrous children on allhallows night and they had taken walker first why was thatwasnt he innocent enough why not come straight for herhadnt she killed those little rattlers alone then she thought of the curses form as told by the indians she wouldnt be killedjust turned to a spotted snake ugh so she would be like those things she had glimpsed on the floorthose things which yig had sent to get her and enroll her among their number she tried to mumble a charm that walker had taught her but found she could not utter a single soundthe noisy ticking of the alarmclock sounded above the maddening beat of the distant tomtoms the snakes were taking a long timedid they mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves every now and then she thought she felt a steady insidious pressure on the bedclothes but each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her overwrought nerves the clock ticked on in the dark and a change came slowly over her thoughtsthose snakescouldnthave taken so long they couldnt be yigs messengers after all but just natural rattlers that were nested below the rock and had been drawn there by the fire they werent coming for her perhapsperhaps they had sated themselves on poor walker where were they now gone coiled by the fire still crawling over the prone corpse of their victim the clock ticked and the distant drums throbbed onat the thought of her husbands body lying there in the pitch blackness a thrill of purely physical horror passed over audrey that story of sally comptons about the man back in scott county he too had been bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes and what had happened to him the poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse and in the end the bloated thing hadbursthorriblyburst horribly with a detestable popping noise was that what was happening to walker down there on the rock floor instinctively she felt she had begun tolistenfor something too terrible even to name to herselfthe clock ticked on keeping a kind of mocking sardonic time with the faroff drumming that the nightwind brought she wished it were a striking clock so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil must last she cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her from fainting and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring after all probably neighbours would passno doubt somebody would callwould they find her still sane was she still sane nowmorbidly listening audrey all at once became aware of something which she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could believe it and which once verified she did not know whether to welcome or dreadthe distant beating of the indian tomtoms had ceasedthey had always maddened herbut had not walker regarded them as a bulwark against nameless evil from outside the universe what were some of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking with grey eagle and the wichita medicinemenshe did not relish this new and sudden silence after all there was something sinister about it the loudticking clock seemed abnormal in its new loneliness capable at last of conscious motion she shook the covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window it must have cleared after the moon set for she saw the square aperture distinctly against the background of starsthen without warning came that shocking unutterable soundughthat dull putridpopof cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark godsallys storythat obscene stench and this gnawing clawing silence it was too much the bonds of muteness snapped and the black night waxed reverberant with audreys screams of stark unbridled frenzyconsciousness did not pass away with the shock how merciful if only it had amidst the echoes of her shrieking audrey still saw the starsprinkled square of window ahead and heard the doomboding ticking of that frightful clock did she hear another sound was that square window still a perfect square she was in no condition to weigh the evidence of her senses or distinguish between fact and hallucinationnothat window was not a perfect squaresomething had encroached on the lower edgenor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the room there was beyond dispute a heavy breathing neither her own nor poor wolfs wolf slept very silently and his wakeful wheezing was unmistakable then audrey saw against the stars the black daemoniac silhouette of something anthropoidthe undulant bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders fumbling slowly toward heryaaaah yaaaah go away go away go away snakedevil go way yig i didnt mean to kill emi was feared hed be scairt of em dont yig dont i didnt go for to hurt yore chillendont come nigh medont change me into no spotted snakebut the halfformless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the bed very silentlyeverything snapped at once inside audreys head and in a second she had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman she knew where the axe washung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern it was within easy reach and she could find it in the dark before she was conscious of anything further it was in her hands and she was creeping toward the foot of the bedtoward the monstrous head and shoulders that every moment groped their way nearer had there been any light the look on her face would not have been pleasant to seetakethatyou andthatandthatandthatshe was laughing shrilly now and her cackles mounted higher as she saw that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic pallor of coming dawndr mcneill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his glasses again i waited for him to resume and as he kept silent i spoke softlyshe lived she was found was it ever explainedthe doctor cleared his throatyesshe lived in a way and it was explained i told you there was no bewitchmentonly cruel pitiful material horrorit was sally compton who had made the discovery she had ridden over to the davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with audrey and had seen no smoke from the chimney that was queer it had turned very warm again yet audrey was usually cooking something at that hour the mules were making hungrysounding noises in the barn and there was no sign of old wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the dooraltogether sally did not like the look of the place so was very timid and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked she got no answer but waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs the lock it appeared was unfastened and she slowly pushed her way in then perceiving what was there she reeled back gasped and clung to the jamb to preserve her balancea terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door but that was not what had stunned her it was what she had seen for within that shadowy cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholdernear the burnedout fireplace was the great dogpurple decay on the skin left bare by mange and old age and the whole carcass burst by the puffing effect of rattlesnake poison it must have been bitten by a veritable legion of the reptilesto the right of the door was the axehacked remnant of what had been a manclad in a nightshirt and with the shattered bulk of a lantern clenched in one handhe was totally free from any sign of snakebitenear him lay the ensanguined axe carelessly discardedand wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome vacanteyed thing that had been a woman but was now only a mute mad caricature all that this thing could do was to hiss and hiss and hissboth the doctor and i were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by this time he poured something from a flask on his desk took a nip and handed another glass to me i could only suggest tremulously and stupidlyso walker had only fainted that first timethe screams roused him and the axe did the restyes dr mcneills voice was low but he met his death from snakes just the same it was his fear working in two waysit made him faint and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to strike out when she thought she saw the snakedevili thought for a momentand audreywasnt it queer how the curse of yig

i am writing this under an appreciable mental strain since by tonight i shall be no more penniless and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable i can bear the torture no longer and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below do not think from my slavery to morphine that i am a weakling or a degenerate when you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may guess though never fully realise why it is that i must have forgetfulness or deathit was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad pacific that the packet of which i was supercargo fell a victim to the german searaider the great war was then at its very beginning and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners so liberal indeed was the discipline of our captors that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of timewhen i finally found myself adrift and free i had but little idea of my surroundings never a competent navigator i could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that i was somewhat south of the equator of the longitude i knew nothing and no island or coastline was in sight the weather kept fair and for uncounted days i drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun waiting either for some passing ship or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land but neither ship nor land appeared and i began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken bluethe change happened whilst i slept its details i shall never know for my slumber though troubled and dreaminfested was continuous when at last i awaked it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as i could see and in which my boat lay grounded some distance awaythough one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery i was in reality more horrified than astonished for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very core the region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish and of other less describable things which i saw protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain perhaps i should not hope to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren immensity there was nothing within hearing and nothing in sight save a vast reach of black slime yet the very completeness of the stillness and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fearthe sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its cloudless cruelty as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet as i crawled into the stranded boat i realised that only one theory could explain my position through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths so great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me that i could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean strain my ears as i might nor were there any seafowl to prey upon the dead thingsfor several hours i sat thinking or brooding in the boat which lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens as the day progressed the ground lost some of its stickiness and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time that night i slept but little and the next day i made for myself a pack containing food and water preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescueon the third morning i found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease the odour of the fish was maddening but i was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil and set out boldly for an unknown goal all day i forged steadily westward guided by a faraway hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert that night i encamped and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when i had first espied it by the fourth evening i attained the base of the mound which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface too weary to ascend i slept in the shadow of the hilli know not why my dreams were so wild that night but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain i was awake in a cold perspiration determined to sleep no more such visions as i had experienced were too much for me to endure again and in the glow of the moon i saw how unwise i had been to travel by day without the glare of the parching sun my journey would have cost me less energy indeed i now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset picking up my pack i started for the crest of the eminencei have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me but i think my horror was greater when i gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to illumine i felt myself on the edge of the world peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night through my terror ran curious reminiscences ofparadise lostand of satans hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darknessas the moon climbed higher in the sky i began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as i had imagined ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet the declivity became very gradual urged on by an impulse which i cannot definitely analyse i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had yet penetratedall at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope which rose steeply about an hundred yards ahead of me an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon that it was merely a gigantic piece of stone i soon assured myself but i was conscious of a distinct impression that its contour and position were not altogether the work of nature a closer scrutiny filled me with sensations i cannot express for despite its enormous magnitude and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the world was young i perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a wellshaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking creaturesdazed and frightened yet not without a certain thrill of the scientists or archaeologists delight i examined my surroundings more closely the moon now near the zenith shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm and revealed the fact that a farflung body of water flowed at the bottom winding out of sight in both directions and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the slope across the chasm the wavelets washed the base of the cyclopean monolith on whose surface i could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures the writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to me and unlike anything i had ever seen in books consisting for the most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes eels octopi crustaceans molluscs whales and the like several characters obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern world but whose decomposing forms i had observed on the oceanrisen plainit was the pictorial carving however that did most to hold me spellbound plainly visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size were an array of basreliefs whose subjects would have excited the envy of a dor i think that these things were supposed to depict menat least a certain sort of men though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well of their faces and forms i dare not speak in detail for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint grotesque beyond the imagination of a poe or a bulwer they were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet shockingly wide and flabby lips glassy bulging eyes and other features less pleasant to recall curiously enough they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background for one of the creatures was shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself i remarked as i say their grotesqueness and strange size but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the piltdown or neanderthal man was born awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist i stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before methen suddenly i saw it with only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface the thing slid into view above the dark waters vast polyphemuslike and loathsome it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds i think i went mad thenof my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat i remember little i believe i sang a great deal and laughed oddly when i was unable to sing i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat at any rate i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moodswhen i came out of the shadows i was in a san francisco hospital brought thither by the captain of the american ship which had picked up my boat in midocean in my delirium i had said much but found that my words had been given scant attention of any land upheaval in the pacific my rescuers knew nothing nor did i deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which i knew they could not believe once i sought out a celebrated ethnologist and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient philistine legend of dagon the fishgod but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional i did not press my inquiriesit is at night especially when the moon is gibbous and waning that i see the thing i tried morphine but the drug has given only transient surcease and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave so now i am to end it all having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellowmen often i ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasma mere freak of fever as i lay sunstricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the german manofwar this i ask myself but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply i cannot think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of watersoaked granite i dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny warexhausted mankindof a day when the land shall sink and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemoniumthe end is near i hear a noise at the door as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it it shall not find me godthat handthe window the window,1
a little after noon on the twentyeighth day of june 1924 dr morehouse stopped his machine before the tanner place and four men alighted the stone building in perfect repair and freshness stood near the road and but for the swamp in the rear it would have possessed no trace of dark suggestion the spotless white doorway was visible across a trim lawn for some distance down the road and as the doctors party approached it could be seen that the heavy portal yawned wide open only the screen door was closed the proximity of the house had imposed a kind of nervous silence on the four men for what lurked therein could only be imagined with vague terror this terror underwent a marked abatement when the explorers heard distinctly the sound of richard blakes typewriterless than an hour before a grown man had fled from that house hatless coatless and screaming to fall upon the doorstep of his nearest neighbor half a mile away babbling incoherently of house dark swamp and room dr morehouse had needed no further spur to excited action when told that a slavering maddened creature had burst out of the old tanner home by the edge of the swamp he had known that something would happen when the two men had taken the accursed stone housethe man who had fled and his master richard blake the authorpoet from boston the genius who had gone into the war with every nerve and sense alert and had come out as he was now still debonair though half a paralytic still walking with song among the sights and sounds of living fantasy though shut forever from the physical world deaf dumb and blindblake had reveled in the weird traditions and shuddering hints about the house and its former tenants such eldritch lore was an imaginative asset from whose enjoyment his physical state might not bar him he had smiled at the prognostications of the superstitious natives now with his sole companion fled in a mad ecstasy of panic fright and himself left helpless with whatever had caused that fright blake might have less occasion to revel and smile this at least was dr morehouses reflection as he had faced the problem of the fugitive and called on the puzzled cottager to help him track the matter down the morehouses were an old fenham family and the doctors grandfather had been one of those who burned the hermit simeon tanners body in 1819 not even at this distance could the trained physician escape a spinal tingle at what was recorded of that burningat the naive inferences drawn by ignorant countrymen from a slight and meaningless conformation of the deceased that tingle he knew to be foolish for trifling bony protuberances on the fore part of the skull are of no significance and often observable in baldheaded menamong the four men who ultimately set resolute faces toward that abhorrent house in the doctors care there occurred a singularly awed exchange of vague legends and halffurtive scraps of gossip handed down from curious grandmotherslegends and hints seldom repeated and almost never systematically compared they extended as far back as 1692 when a tanner had perished on gallows hill in salem after a witchcraft trial but did not grow intimate till the time the house was built1747 though the ell was more recent not even then were the tales very numerous for queer though the tanners all were it was only the last of them old simeon whom people desperately feared he added to what he had inheritedadded horribly everyone whisperedand bricked up the windows of the southeast room whose east wall gave on the swamp that was his study and library and it had a door of double thickness with braces it had been chopped through with axes that terrible winter night in 1819 when the stinking smoke had poured from the chimney and they found tanners body in therewith that expression on its face it was because of that expressionnot because of the two bony protuberances beneath the bushy white hairthat they had burned the body and the books and manuscripts it had had in that room however the short distance to the tanner place was covered before much important historical matter could be correlatedas the doctor at the head of the party opened the screen door and entered the arched hallway it was noticed that the sound of typewriting had suddenly ceased at this point two of the men also thought they noticed a faint effusion of cold air strangely out of keeping with the great heat of the day though they afterward refused to swear to this the hall was in perfect order as were the various rooms entered in quest of the study where blake was presumably to be found the author had furnished his home in exquisite colonial taste and though having no help but the one manservant he had succeeded in maintaining it in a state of commendable neatnessdr morehouse led his men from room to room through the wideopen doors and archways at last finding the library or study which he soughta fine southerly room on the ground floor adjoining the oncedreaded study of simeon tanner lined with the books which the servant communicated through an ingenious alphabet of touches and the bulky braille volumes which the author himself read with sensitive fingertips richard blake of course was there seated as usual before his typewriter with a draftscattered stack of newly written pages on the table and floor and one sheet still in the machine he had stopped work it appeared with some suddenness perhaps because of a chill which had caused him to draw together the neck of his dressinggown and his head was turned toward the doorway of the sunny adjoining room in a manner quite singular for one whose lack of sight and hearing shuts out all sense of the external worldon drawing nearer and crossing to where he could see the authors face dr morehouse turned very pale and motioned to the others to stand back he needed time to steady himself and to dispel all possibility of hideous illusion no longer did he need to speculate why they had burned old simeon tanners body on that wintry night because of theexpressionit wore for here was something only a welldisciplined mind could confront the late richard blake whose typewriter had ceased its nonchalant clicking only as the men had entered the house had seen something despite his blindness and had been affected by it humanity had nothing to do with the look that was on his face or with the glassy morbid vision that blazed in great blue bloodshot eyes shut to this worlds images for six years those eyes were fixed with an ecstasy of clearsighted horror on the doorway leading to simeon tanners old study where the sun blazed on walls once shrouded in brickedup blackness and dr arlo morehouse reeled dizzily when he saw that for all the dazzling daylight the inky pupils of those eyes were dilated as cavernously as those of a cats eyes in the darkthe doctor closed the staring blind eyes before he let the others view the face of the corpse meanwhile he examined the lifeless form with feverish diligence using scrupulous technical care despite his throbbing nerves and almost shaking hands some of his results he communicated from time to time to the awed and inquisitive trio around him other results he judiciously withheld lest they lead to speculations more disquieting than human speculations should be it was not from any word of his but from shrewd independent observation that one of the men muttered about the bodys tousled black hair and the way the papers were scattered this man said it was as if a strong breeze had blown through the open doorway which the dead man faced whereas although the oncebricked windows beyond were indeed fully open to the warm june air there had been scarcely a breath of wind during the entire daywhen one of the men began to gather the sheets of newly written manuscript as they lay on floor and table dr morehouse stopped him with an alarmed gesture he had seen the sheet that remained in the machine and had hastily removed and pocketed it after a sentence or two blanched his face afresh this incident prompted him to collect the scattered sheets himself and stuff them bulkily into an inside pocket without stopping to arrange them and not even what he had read terrified him half so much as what he now noticedthe subtle difference in touch and heaviness of typing which distinguished the sheets he picked up from the one he had found on the typewriter this shadowy impression he could not divorce from that other horrible circumstance which he was so zealously concealing from the men who had heard the machines clicking not ten minutes beforethe circumstance he was trying to exclude from even his own mind till he could be alone and resting in the merciful depths of his morris chair one may judge of the fear he felt at that circumstance by considering what he braved to keep it suppressed in more than thirty years of professional practice he had never regarded a medical examiner as one from whom a fact might be withheld yet through all the formalities which now followed no man ever knew that when he examined this staring contorted blind mans body he had seen at oncethat death must have occurred at least half an hour before discoverydr morehouse presently closed the outer door and led the party through every corner of the ancient structure in search of any evidence which might directly illuminate the tragedy never was a result more completely negative he knew that the trapdoor of old simeon tanner had been removed as soon as that recluses books and body had been burnt and that the subcellar and the sinuous tunnel under the swamp had been filled up as soon as they were discovered some thirtyfive years later now he saw that no fresh abnormalities had come to replace them and that the whole establishment exhibited only the normal neatness of modern restoration and tasteful caretelephoning for the sheriff at fenham and for the county medical examiner at bayboro he awaited the arrival of the former who when he came insisted on swearing in two of the men as deputies until the examiner should arrive dr morehouse knowing the mystification and futility confronting the officials could not help smiling wryly as he left with the villager whose house still sheltered the man who had fledthey found the patient exceedingly weak but conscious and fairly composed having promised the sheriff to extract and transmit all possible information from the fugitive dr morehouse began some calm and tactful questioning which was received in a rational and compliant spirit and baffled only by effacement of memory much of the mans quiet must have come from merciful inability to recollect for all he could now tell was that he had been in the study with his master and had seemed to see the next room suddenly grow darkthe room where sunshine had for more than a hundred years replaced the gloom of brickedup windows even this memory which indeed he half doubted greatly disturbed the unstrung nerves of the patient and it was with the utmost gentleness and circumspection that dr morehouse told him his master was deada natural victim of the cardiac weakness which his terrible wartime injuries must have caused the man was grieved for he had been devoted to the crippled author but he promised to show fortitude in taking the body back to the family in boston after the close of the medical examiners formal inquirythe physician after satisfying as vaguely as possible the curiosity of the householder and his wife and urging them to shelter the patient and keep him from the tanner house until his departure with the body next drove home in a growing tremble of excitement at last he was free to read the typed manuscript of the dead man and to gain at least an inkling of what hellish thing had defied those shattered senses of sight and sound and penetrated so disastrously to the delicate intelligence that brooded in external darkness and silence he knew it would be a grotesque and terrible perusal and he did not hasten to begin it instead he very deliberately put his car in the garage made himself comfortable in a dressinggown and placed a stand of sedative and restorative medicines beside the great chair he was to occupy even after that he obviously wasted time as he slowly arranged the numbered sheets carefully avoiding any comprehensive glance at their textwhat the manuscript did to dr morehouse we all know it would never have been read by another had his wife not picked it up as he lay inert in his chair an hour later breathing heavily and unresponsive to a knocking which one would have thought violent enough to arouse a mummied pharaoh terrible as the document is particularly in the obviouschange of stylenear the end we cannot avoid the belief that to the folklorewise physician it presented someadded and supreme horrorwhich no other will ever be so unfortunate as to receive certainly it is the general opinion of fenham that the doctors wide familiarity with the mutterings of old people and the tales his grandfather told him in youth furnished him some special information in the light of which richard blakes hideous chronicle acquired a new clear and devastating significance nearly insupportable to the normal human mind that would explain the slowness of his recovery on that june evening the reluctance with which he permitted his wife and son to read the manuscript the singular illgrace with which he acceded to their determination not to burn a document so darkly remarkable and most of all the peculiar rashness with which he hastened to purchase the old tanner property destroy the house with dynamite and cut down the trees of the swamp for a substantial distance from the road concerning the whole subject he now maintains an inflexible reticence and it is certain that there will die with him a knowledge without which the world is better offthe manuscript as here appended was copied through the courtesy of floyd morehouse esq son of the physician a few omissions indicated by asterisks have been made in the interest of the public peace of mind still others have been occasioned by the indefiniteness of the text where the stricken authors lightninglike touchtyping seems shaken into incoherence or ambiguity in three places where lacunae are fairly well elucidated by the context the task of recension has been attempted of thechange in stylenear the end it were best to say nothing surely it is plausible enough to attribute the phenomenon as regards both content and physical aspect of typing to the racked and tottering mind of a victim whose former handicaps had paled to nothing before that which he now faced bolder minds are at liberty to supply their own deductionshere then is the document written in an accursed house by a brain closed to the worlds sights and soundsa brain left alone and unwarned to the mercies and mockeries of powers that no seeing hearing man has ever stayed to face contradictory as it is to all that we know of the universe through physics chemistry and biology the logical mind will classify it as a singular product of dementiaa dementia communicated in some sympathetic way to the man who burst out of that house in time and thus indeed may it very well be regarded so long as dr arlo morehouse maintains his silencethe manuscriptvague misgivings of the last quarter hour are now becoming definite fears to begin with i am thoroughly convinced that something must have happened to dobbs for the first time since we have been together he has failed to answer my summons when he did not respond to my repeated ringing i decided that the bell must be out of order but i have pounded on the table with vigor enough to rouse a charge of charon at first i thought he might have slipped out of the house for a breath of fresh air for it has been hot and sultry all the forenoon but it is not like dobbs to stay away so long without first making sure that i would want nothing it is however the unusual occurrence of the last few minutes which confirms my suspicion that dobbss absence is a matter beyond his control it is this same happening which prompts me to put my impressions and conjectures on paper in the hope that the mere act of recording them may relieve a certain sinister suggestion of impending tragedy try as i will i cannot free my mind from the legends connected with this old housemere superstitious folderol for dwarfed brains to revel in and on which i would not even waste a thought if dobbs were herethrough the years that i have been shut away from the world i used to know dobbs has been my sixth sense now for the first time since my incapacitation i realize the full extent of my impotency it is dobbs who had compensated for my sightless eyes my useless ears my voiceless throat and my crippled legs there is a glass of water on my typewriter table without dobbs to fill it when it has been emptied my plight will be like that of tantalus few have come to this house since we have lived herethere is little in common between garrulous country folk and a paralytic who cannot see hear or speak to themit may be days before anyone else appears alone with only my thoughts to keep me company disquieting thoughts which have been in no wise assuaged by the sensations of the last few minutes i do not like these sensations either for more and more they are converting mere village gossip into a fantastic imagery which affects my emotions in a most peculiar and almost unprecedented mannerit seems hours since i started to write this but i know it can be only a few minutes for i have just inserted this fresh page into the machine the mechanical action of switching the sheets brief though it was has given me a fresh grip on myself perhaps i can shake off this sense of approaching danger long enough to recount that which has already happenedat first it was no more than a mere tremor somewhat similar to the shivering of a cheap tenement block when a heavy truck rumbles close by the curbbut this is no loosely built frame structure perhaps i am supersensitive to such things and it may be that i am allowing my imagination to play tricks but it seemed to me that the disturbance was more pronounced directly in front of meand my chair faces the southeast wing away from the road directly in line with the swamp at the rear of the dwelling delusion though this may have been there is no denying what followed i was reminded of moments when i have felt the ground tremble beneath my feet at the bursting of giant shells times when i have seen ships tossed like chaff before the fury of a typhoon the house shook like a dweurgarian cinder in the sieves of niflheim every timber in the floor beneath my feet quivered like a suffering thing my typewriter trembled till i could imagine that the keys were chattering of their feara brief moment and it was over everything is as calm as before altogether too calm it seems impossible that such a thing could happen and yet leave everything exactly as it was before no not exactlyi am thoroughly convinced that something has happened to dobbs it is this conviction added to this unnatural calm which accentuates the premonitory fear that persists in creeping over me fear yesthough i am trying to reason sanely with myself that there is nothing of which to be afraid critics have both praised and condemned my poetry because of what they term a vivid imagination at such a time as this i can heartily agree with those who cry too vivid nothing can be very much amiss or smoke just a faint sulfurous trace but one which is unmistakable to my keenly attuned nostrils so faint indeed that it is impossible for me to determine whether it comes from some part of the house or drifts through the window of the adjoining room which opens on the swamp the impression is rapidly becoming more clearly defined i am sure now that it does not come from outside vagrant visions of the past somber scenes of other days flash before me in stereoscopic review a flaming factory hysterical screams of terrified women penned in by walls of fire a blazing schoolhouse pitiful cries of helpless children trapped by collapsing stairs a theatre fire frantic babel of panicstricken people fighting to freedom over blistering floors and over all impenetrable clouds of black noxious malicious smoke polluting the peaceful sky the air of the room is saturated with thick heavy stifling waves at any moment i expect to feel hot tongues of flame lick eagerly at my useless legs my eyes smart my ears throb i cough and choke to rid my lungs of the ocypetean fumes smoke such as is associated only with appalling catastrophes acrid stinking mephitic smoke permeated with the revolting odor of burning flesh once more i am alone with this portentous calm the welcome breeze that fans my cheeks is fast restoring my vanished courage clearly the house cannot be on fire for every vestige of the torturous smoke is gone i cannot detect a single trace of it though i have been sniffing like a bloodhound i am beginning to wonder if i am going mad if the years of solitude have unhinged my mindbut the phenomenon has been too definite to permit me to class it as mere hallucination sane or insane i cannot conceive these things as aught but actualitiesand the moment i catalogue them as such i can come to only one logical conclusion the inference in itself is enough to upset ones mental stability to concede this is to grant the truth of the superstitious rumors which dobbs compiled from the villagers and transcribed for my sensitive fingertips to readunsubstantial hearsay that my materialistic mind instinctively condemns as asininityi wish the throbbing in my ears would stop it is as if mad spectral players were beating a duet upon the aching drums i suppose it is merely a reaction to the suffocating sensations i have just experienced a few more deep drafts of this refreshing air somethingsomeone is in the room i am as sure i am no longer alone as if i could see the presence i sense so infallibly it is an impression quite similar to one which i have had while elbowing my way through a crowded streetthe definite notion that eyes were singling me out from the rest of the throng with a gaze intense enough to arrest my subconscious attentionthe same sensation only magnified a thousandfold whowhatcan it be after all my fears may be groundless perhaps it means only that dobbs has returned no it is not dobbs as i anticipated the tattoo upon my ears has ceased and a low whisper has caught my attention the overwhelming significance of the thing has just registered itself upon my bewildered brain i can hearit is not a single whispering voice but many lecherous buzzing of bestial blowflies satanic humming of libidinous bees sibilant hissing of obscene reptiles a whispering chorus no human throat could sing it is gaining in volume the room rings with demoniacal chanting tuneless toneless and grotesquely grim a diabolical choir rehearsing unholy litanies paeans of mephistophelian misery set to music of wailing souls a hideous crescendo of pagan pandemonium the voices that surround me are drawing closer to my chair the chanting has come to an abrupt end and the whispering has resolved itself into intelligible sounds i strain my ears to distinguish the words closer and still closer they are clear nowtoo clear better had my ears been blocked forever than forced to listen to their hellish mouthings impious revelations of soulsickening saturnalia ghoulish conceptions of devastating debaucheries profane bribes of cabirian orgies malevolent threats of unimagined punishments it is cold unseasonably cold as if inspired by the cacodemoniacal presences that harass me the breeze that was so friendly a few minutes ago growls angrily about my earsan icy gale that rushes in from the swamp and chills me to the boneif dobbs has deserted me i do not blame him i hold no brief for cowardice or craven fear but there are some things i only hope his fate has been nothing worse than to have departed in timemy last doubt is swept away i am doubly glad now that i have held to my resolve to write down my impressions not that i expect anyone to understand or believe it has been a relief from the maddening strain of idly waiting for each new manifestation of psychic abnormality as i see it there are but three courses that may be taken to flee from this accursed place and spend the torturous years that lie ahead in trying to forgetbut flee icannotto yield to an abominable alliance with forces so malign that tartarus to them would seem but an alcove of paradisebut yield iwill notto diefar rather would i have my body torn limb from limb than to contaminate my soul in barbarous barter with such emissaries of belial i have had to pause for a moment to blow upon my fingers the room is cold with the foetid frigor of the tomb a peaceful numbness is creeping over me i must fight off this lassitude it is undermining my determination to die rather than give in to the insidious importunings i vow anew to resist until the end the end that i know cannot be far away the wind is colder than ever if such a thing be possible a wind freighted with the stench of deadalive things o merciful god who took my sight a wind so cold it burns where it should freeze it has become a blistering sirocco unseen fingers grip me ghost fingers that lack the physical strength to force me from my machine icy fingers that force me into a vile vortex of vice devilfingers that draw me down into a cesspool of eternal iniquity death fingers that shut off my breath and make my sightless eyes feel they must burst with the pain frozen points press against my temples hard bony knobs akin to horns boreal breath of some longdead thing kisses my fevered lips and sears my hot throat with frozen flame it is dark not the darkness that is part of years of blindness the impenetrable darkness of sinsteeped night the pitchblack darkness of purgatory i see spes mea christus it is the end not for mortal mind is any resisting of force beyond human imagination not for immortal spirit is any conquering of that which hath probed the depths and made of immortality a transient moment the end nay it is but the blissful beginning,1
in london there is a man who screams when the church bells ring he lives all alone with his streaked cat in grays inn and people call him harmlessly mad his room is filled with books of the tamest and most puerile kind and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble pages all he seeks from life is not to think for some reason thought is very horrible to him and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague he is very thin and grey and wrinkled but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks fear has its grisly claws upon him and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and sweatbeaded forehead friends and companions he shuns for he wishes to answer no questions those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now he dropped them all years ago and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway it is a decade now since he moved into grays inn and of where he had been he would say nothing till the night young williams bought thenecronomiconwilliams was a dreamer and only twentythree and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room he forced his friendship where old friends dared not force theirs and marvelled at the fright that sat upon this gaunt haggard watcher and listener for that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay insipid novels and when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and scream and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last peal died reverberantly awaybut try as williams would he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or hidden the old man would not live up to his aspect and manner but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto that his learning was deep and thorough his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear and williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to harrow and oxford later it developed that he was none other than lord northam of whose ancient hereditary castle on the yorkshire coast so many odd things were told but when williams tried to talk of the castle and of its reputed roman origin he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it he even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the north sea was brought upso matters went till that night when williams brought home the infamousnecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred he had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in chandos street and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it the old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful blackletter but now at last he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure it was at a jews shop in the squalid precincts of clare market where he had often bought strange things before and he almost fancied the gnarled old levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made the bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible and the price was so absurdly slightthe one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports and some of the diagrams set in the vague latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain he felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old jew chuckled disturbingly behind him but when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of blackletter and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist and reluctantly called on his strange frightened friend for help with the twisted mediaeval latin lord northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat and started violently when the young man entered then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly and fainted altogether when williams uttered the title it was when he regained his senses that he told his story told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashesthere must lord northam whispered have been something wrong at the start but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far he was the nineteenth baron of a line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the pastunbelievably far if vague tradition could be heeded for there were family tales of a descent from presaxon times when a certain cnaeus gabinius capito military tribune in the third augustan legion then stationed at lindum in roman britain had been summarily expelled from his command for participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion gabinius had the rumour ran come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the elder sign in the dark strange folk whom the britons knew not save in fear and who were the last to survive from a great land in the west that had sunk leaving only the islands with the raths and circles and shrines of which stonehenge was the greatest there was no certainty of course in the legend that gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a line which pict and saxon dane and norman were powerless to obliterate or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the black prince whom edward third created baron of northam these things were not certain yet they were often told and in truth the stonework of northam keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of hadrians wall as a child lord northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for halfamorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience he became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying a searcher for strange realms and relationships once familiar yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earthfilled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and ominous and that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the known at every point northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult mystery nowhere however could he find ease and content and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him during the nineties he dabbled in satanism and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of nature books like ignatius donnellys chimerical account of atlantis he absorbed with zest and a dozen obscure precursors of charles fort enthralled him with their vagaries he would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder and once went into the desert of araby to seek a nameless city of faint report which no man has ever beheld there rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed which if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back of his memory it might be in the visible world yet it might be only in his mind and soul perhaps he held within his own halfexplored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions which would bind him to the stars and to the infinities and eternities beyond them,1
editors note alonzo hasbrouck typer of kingston ny was last seen and recognised on april 17 1908 around noon at the hotel richmond in batavia he was the only survivor of an ancient ulster county family and was fiftythree years old at the time of his disappearancemr typer was educated privately and at columbia and heidelberg universities all his life was spent as a student the field of his researches including many obscure and generally feared borderlands of human knowledge his papers on vampirism ghouls and poltergeist phenomena were privately printed after rejection by many publishers he resigned from the society for psychical research in 1902 after a series of peculiarly bitter controversiesat various times mr typer travelled extensively sometimes dropping out of sight for long periods he is known to have visited obscure spots in nepal india thibet and indochina and passed most of the year 1899 on mysterious easter island the extensive search for mr typer after his disappearance yielded no results and his estate was divided among distant cousins in new york citythe diary herewith presented was allegedly found in the ruins of a large country house near attica ny which had borne a curiously sinister reputation for generations before its collapse the edifice was very old antedating the general white settlement of the region and had formed the home of a strange and secretive family named van der heyl which had migrated from albany in 1746 under a curious cloud of witchcraft suspicion the structure probably dated from about 1760of the history of the van der heyls very little is known they remained entirely aloof from their normal neighbours employed negro servants brought directly from africa and speaking little english and educated their children privately and at european colleges those of them who went out into the world were soon lost to sight though not before gaining evil repute for association with black mass groups and cults of even darker significancearound the dreaded house a straggling village arose populated by indians and later by renegades from the surrounding country which bore the dubious name of chorazin of the singular hereditary strains which afterward appeared in the mixed chorazin villagers several monographs have been written by ethnologists just behind the village and in sight of the van der heyl house is a steep hill crowned with a peculiar ring of ancient standing stones which the iroquois always regarded with fear and loathing the origin and nature of the stones whose date according to archaeological and climatological evidence must be fabulously early is a problem still unsolvedfrom about 1795 onward the legends of the incoming pioneers and later population have much to say about strange cries and chants proceeding at certain seasons from chorazin and from the great house and hill of standing stones though there is reason to suppose that the noises ceased about 1872 when the entire van der heyl householdservants and allsuddenly and simultaneously disappearedthenceforward the house was deserted for other disastrous eventsincluding three unexplained deaths five disappearances and four cases of sudden insanityoccurred when later owners and interested visitors attempted to stay in it the house village and extensive rural areas on all sides reverted to the state and were auctioned off in the absence of discoverable van der heyl heirs since about 1890 the owners successively the late charles a shields and his son oscar s shields of buffalo have left the entire property in a state of absolute neglect and have warned all inquirers not to visit the regionof those known to have approached the house during the last forty years most were occult students police officers newspaper men and odd characters from abroad among the latter was a mysterious eurasian probably from cochinchina whose later appearance with blank mind and bizarre mutilations excited wide press notice in 1903mr typers diarya book about 6 3 inches in size with tough paper and an oddly durable binding of thin sheet metalwas discovered in the possession of one of the decadent chorazin villagers on nov 16 1935 by a state policeman sent to investigate the rumoured collapse of the deserted van der heyl mansion the house had indeed fallen obviously from sheer age and decrepitude in the severe gale of nov 12 disintegration was peculiarly complete and no thorough search of the ruins could be made for several weeks john eagle the swarthy simianfaced indianlike villager who had the diary said that he found the book quite near the surface of the debris in what must have been an upper front roomvery little of the contents of the house could be identified though an enormous and astonishingly solid brick vault in the cellar whose ancient iron door had to be blasted open because of the strangely figured and perversely tenacious lock remained intact and presented several puzzling features for one thing the walls were covered with still undeciphered hieroglyphs roughly incised in the brickwork another peculiarity was a huge circular aperture in the rear of the vault blocked by a cavein evidently caused by the collapse of the housebut strangest of all was the apparentlyrecentdeposit of some foetid slimy pitchblack substance on the flagstoned floor extending in a yardbroad irregular line with one end at the blocked circular aperture those who first opened the vault declared that the place smelled like the snakehouse at a zoothe diary which was apparently designed solely to cover an investigation of the dreaded van der heyl house by the vanished mr typer has been proved by handwriting experts to be genuine the script shews signs of increasing nervous strain as it progresses toward the end in places becoming almost illegible chorazin villagerswhose stupidity and taciturnity baffle all students of the region and its secretsadmit no recollection of mr typer as distinguished from other rash visitors to the dreaded housethe text of the diary is here given verbatim and without comment how to interpret it and what other than the writers madness to infer from it the reader must decide for himself only the future can tell what its value may be in solving a generationold mystery it may be remarked that genealogists confirm mr typers belated memory in the matter ofadriaen sleghtthe diaryapril 17 1908arrived here about 6 pm had to walk all the way from attica in the teeth of an oncoming storm for no one would rent me a horse or rig and i cant run an automobile this place is even worse than i had expected and i dread what is coming even though i long at the same time to learn the secret all too soon will come the nightthe old walpurgis sabbat horrorand after that time in wales i know what to look for whatever comes i shall not flinch prodded by some unfathomable urge i have given my whole life to the quest of unholy mysteries i came here for nothing else and will not quarrel with fateit was very dark when i got here though the sun had by no means set the stormclouds were the densest i had ever seen and i could not have found my way but for the lightning flashes the village is a hateful little backwater and its few inhabitants no better than idiots one of them saluted me in a queer way as if he knew me i could see very little of the landscapejust a small swampy valley of strange brown weedstalks and dead fungi surrounded by scraggly evilly twisted trees with bare boughs but behind the village is a dismallooking hill on whose summit is a circle of great stones with another stone at the centre that without question is the vile primordial thing v told me about at the n estbatthe great house lies in the midst of a park all overgrown with curiouslooking briers i could scarcely break through and when i did the vast age and decrepitude of the building almost stopped me from entering the place looked filthy and diseased and i wondered how so leprous a bulk could hang together it is wooden and though its original lines are hidden by a bewildering tangle of wings added at various dates i think it was first built in the square colonial fashion of new england probably that was easier to build than a dutch stone houseand then too i recall that dirck van der heyls wife was from salem a daughter of the unmentionable abaddon corey there was a small pillared porch and i got under it just as the storm burst it was a fiendish tempestblack as midnight with rain in sheets thunder and lightning like the day of general dissolution and a wind that actually clawed at me the door was unlocked so i took out my electric torch and went inside dust was inches thick on floor and furniture and the place smelled like a mouldcaked tomb there was a hall reaching all the way through and a curving staircase on the right i ploughed a way upstairs and selected this front room to camp out in the whole place seems fully furnished though most of the furniture is breaking down this is written at eight oclock after a cold meal from my travellingcase after this the village people will bring me suppliesthough they wont agree to come any closer than the ruins of the park gate until as they say later i wish i could get rid of an unpleasant feeling of familiarity with this placelateri am conscious of several presences in this house one in particular is decidedly hostile toward mea malevolent will which is seeking to break down my own and overcome me i must not countenance this for an instant but must use all my forces to resist it it is appallingly evil and definitely nonhuman i think it must be allied to powers outside earthpowers in the spaces behind time and beyond the universe it towers like a colossus bearing out what is said in the aklo writings there is such a feeling of vast size connected with it that i wonder these chambers can contain its bulkand yet it has no visible bulk its age must be unutterably vastshockingly indescribably soapril 18slept very little last night at 3 am a strange creeping wind began to pervade the whole regionever rising until the house rocked as if in a typhoon as i went down the staircase to see to the rattling front door the darkness took halfvisible forms in my imagination just below the landing i was pushed violently from behindby the wind i suppose though i could have sworn i saw the dissolving outlines of a gigantic black paw as i turned quickly about i did not lose my footing but safely finished the descent and shot the heavy bolt of the dangerously shaking doori had not meant to explore the house till dawn yet now unable to sleep again and fired with mixed terror and curiosity i felt reluctant to postpone my search with my powerful torch i ploughed through the dust to the great south parlour where i knew the portraits would be there they were just as v had said and as i seemed to know from some obscurer source as well some were so blackened mouldy and dustclouded that i could make little or nothing of them but from those i could trace i recognised that they were indeed of the hateful line of the van der heyls some of the paintings seemed to suggest faces i had known but justwhatfaces i could not recallthe outlines of that frightful hybrid jorisspawned in 1773 by old dircks youngest daughterwere clearest of all and i could trace the green eyes and the serpent look in his face every time i shut off the flashlight that face would seem to glow in the dark until i half fancied it shone with a faint greenish light of its own the more i looked the more evil it seemed and i turned away to avoid hallucinations of changing expressionbut that to which i turned was even worse the long dour face small closely set eyes and swinelike features identified it at once even though the artist had striven to make the snout look as human as possible this was what v had whispered about as i stared in horror i thought the eyes took on a reddish glowand for a moment the background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scenea lone bleak moor beneath a dirty yellow sky whereon grew a wretchedlooking blackthorn bush fearing for my sanity i rushed from that accursed gallery to the dustcleared corner upstairs where i have my camplaterdecided to explore some of the labyrinthine wings of the house by daylight i cannot get lost for my footprints are distinct in the ankledeep dustand i can trace other identifying marks when necessary it is curious how easily i learn the intricate windings of the corridors followed a long outflung northerly ell to its extremity and came to a locked door which i forced beyond was a very small room quite crowded with furniture and with the panelling badly wormeaten on the outer wall i spied a black space behind the rotting woodwork and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to unknown black depths it was a steeply inclined chute or tunnel without steps or handholds and i wondered what its use could have beenabove the fireplace was a mouldy painting which i found on close inspection to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late eighteenth century the face is of classic beauty yet with the most fiendishly evil expression which i have ever known the human countenance to bear not merely callousness greed and cruelty but some quality hideous beyond human comprehension seems to sit upon those finely carved features and as i looked it seemed to me that the artistor the slow processes of mould and decayhad imparted to that pallid complexion a sickly greenish cast and the least suggestion of an almost imperceptibly scaly texture later i ascended to the attic where i found several chests of strange booksmany of utterly alien aspect in letters and in physical form alike one contained variants of the aklo formulae which i had never known to exist i have not yet examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairsapril 19there are certainly unseen presences here even though the dust as yet bears no footprints but my own cut a path through the briers yesterday to the park gate where my supplies are left but this morning i found it closed very odd since the bushes are hardly stirring with spring sap again i had that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the chambers can scarcely contain it this time i feel more than one of the presences is of such a size and i know now that the third aklo ritualwhich i found in that book in the attic yesterdaywould make such beings solid and visible whether i shall dare to try this materialisation remains to be seen the perils are greatlast night i began to glimpse evanescent shadowfaces and forms in the dim corners of the halls and chambersfaces and forms so hideous and loathsome that i dare not describe them they seem allied in substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me down the stairs night before lastand must of course be phantoms of my disturbed imagination what i am seeking would not be quite like these things i have seen the paw againsometimes alone and sometimes with its matebut i have resolved to ignore all such phenomenaearly this afternoon i explored the cellar for the first timedescending by a ladder found in a storeroom since the wooden steps had rotted away the whole place is a mass of nitrous encrustations with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects have disintegrated at the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to extend under the northerly ell where i found the little locked room and at the end of this is a heavy brick wall with a locked iron door apparently belonging to a vault of some sort this wall and door bear evidences of eighteenthcentury workmanship and must be contemporary with the oldest additions to the houseclearly prerevolutionary on the lockwhich is obviously older than the rest of the ironworkare engraved certain symbols which i cannot decipherv had not told me about this vault it fills me with a greater disquiet than anything else i have seen for every time i approach it i have an almost irresistible impulse tolistenfor something hitherto no untowardsoundshave marked my stay in this malign place as i left the cellar i wished devoutly that the steps were still therefor my progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow i do not want to go down there againand yet some evil genius urges me to try itat nightif i would learn what is to be learnedapril 20i have sounded the depths of horroronly to be made aware of still lower depths last night the temptation was too strong and in the black small hours i descended once more into that nitrous hellish cellar with my flashlighttiptoeing among the amorphous heaps to that terrible brick wall and locked door i made no sound and refrained from whispering any of the incantations i knew but i listenedlistened with mad intentnessat last i heard the sounds from beyond those barred plates of sheet ironthe menacing padding and muttering as of gigantic nightthings within then too there was a damnable slithering as of a vast serpent or seabeast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor nearly paralysed with fright i glanced at the huge rusty lock and at the alien cryptic hieroglyphs graven upon it they were signs i could not recognise and something in their vaguely mongoloid technique hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity at times i fancied i could see them glowing with a greenish lighti turned to flee but found that vision of the titan paws before methe great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as i gazed out of the cellars evil blackness they stretched with shadowy hints of scaly wrists beyond them and with a waxing malignant will guiding their horrible gropings then i heard from behind mewithin that abominable vaulta fresh burst of muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder impelled by this greater fear i advanced toward the shadowy paws with my flashlight and saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam then up the ladder i raced torch between my teeth nor did i rest till i had regained my upstairs campwhat is to be my ultimate end i dare not imagine i came as a seeker but now i know that something is seeking me i could not leave if i wished this morning i tried to go to the gate for my supplies but found the briers twisted tightly in my path it was the same in every directionbehind and on all sides of the house in places the brown barbed vines had uncurled to astonishing heightsforming a steellike hedge against my egress the villagers are connected with all this when i went indoors i found my supplies in the great front hall though without any clue to how they came there i am sorry now that i swept the dust away i shall scatter some more and see what prints are leftthis afternoon i read some of the books in the great shadowy library at the rear of the ground floor and formed certain suspicions which i cannot bear to mention i had never seen the text of pnakotic manuscripts or of the eltdown shards before and would not have come here had i known what they contain i believe it is too late nowfor the awful sabbat is only ten days away it is for that night of horror thattheyare saving meapril 21i have been studying the portraits again some have names attached and i noticed oneof an evilfaced woman painted some two centuries agowhich puzzled me it bore the name of trintje van der heyl sleght and i have a distinct impression that i once met the name of sleght before in some significant connexion it was not horrible then though it becomes so now i must rack my brain for the cluetheeyesof these pictures haunt me is it possible that some of them are emerging more distinctly from their shrouds of dust and decay and mould the serpentfaced and swinefaced warlocks stare horribly at me from their blackened frames and a score of other hybrid faces are beginning to peer out of shadowy backgrounds there is a hideous look of family resemblance in them alland that which is human is more horrible than that which is nonhuman i wish they reminded me less of other facesfaces i have known in the past they were an accursed line and cornelis of leyden was the worst of them it washewho broke down the barrier after his father had found that other key i am sure that v knows only a fragment of the horrible truth so that i am indeed unprepared and defenceless what of the line before old claes what he did in 1591 could never have been done without generations of evil heritage or some link with the outside and what of the branches this monstrous line has sent forth are they scattered over the world all awaiting their common heritage of horror i must recall the place where i once so particularly noticed the name of sleghti wish i could be sure that these pictures stay always in their frames for several hours now i have been seeing momentary presences like the earlier paws and shadowfaces and forms but closely duplicating some of the ancient portraits somehow i can never glimpse a presence and the portrait it resembles at the same timethe light is always wrong for one or the other or else the presence and the portrait are in different roomsperhaps as i have hoped the presences are mere figments of imagination but i cannot be sure now some are female and of the same hellish beauty as the picture in the little locked room some are like no portrait i have seen yet make me feel that their painted features lurk unrecognised beneath the mould and soot of canvases i cannot decipher a few i desperately fear have approached materialisation in solid or semisolid formand some have a dreadful and unexplained familiaritythere is one woman who in fell loveliness excels all the rest her poisonous charms are like a honeyed flower growing on the brink of hell when i look at her closely she vanishes only to reappear later her face has a greenish cast and now and then i fancy i can spy a suspicion of the squamose in its smooth texture who is she is she that being who must have dwelt in the little locked room a century and more agomy supplies were again left in the front hallthat clearly is to be the custom i had sprinkled dust about to catch footprints but this morning the whole hall was swept clean by some unknown agencyapril 22this has been a day of horrible discovery i explored the cobwebbed attic again and found a carved crumbling chestplainly from hollandfull of blasphemous books and papers far older than any hitherto encountered here there was a greeknecronomicona normanfrenchlivre deibonand a first edition of old ludvig prinnsde vermis mysteriisbut the old bound manuscript was the worst it was in low latin and full of the strange crabbed handwriting of claes van der heylbeing evidently the diary or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580 when i unfastened the blackened silver clasp and opened the yellowed leaves a coloured drawing fluttered outthe likeness of a monstrous creature resembling nothing so much as a squid beaked and tentacled with great yellow eyes and with certain abominable approximations to the human form in its contoursi had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form on the paws feet and headtentacles were curious clawsreminding me of the colossal shadowshapes which have groped so horribly in my pathwhile the entity as a whole sat upon a great thronelike pedestal inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely chinese cast about both writing and image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and pervasive that i could not think it the product of any one world or age rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the evil in unbounded space throughout the aeons past and to comeand those eldritch symbols be vile sentient eikons endowed with a morbid life of their own and ready to wrest themselves from the parchment for the readers destruction to the meaning of that monster and of those hieroglyphs i had no clue but i knew that both had been traced with a hellish precision and for no namable purpose as i studied the leering characters their kinship to the symbols on that ominous lock in the cellar became more and more manifest i left the picture in the attic for never could sleep come to me with such a thing nearbyall the afternoon and evening i read in the manuscript book of old claes van der heyl and what i read will cloud and make horrible whatever period of life lies ahead of me the genesis of the world and of previous worlds unfolded itself before my eyes i learned of the city shamballah built by the lemurians fifty million years ago yet inviolate still behind its walls of psychic force in the eastern desert i learned of the book of dzyan whose first six chapters antedate the earth and which was old when the lords of venus came through space in their ships to civilise our planet and i saw recorded in writing for the first time that name which others had spoken to me in whispers and which i had known in a closer and more horrible waythe shunned and dreaded name ofyianhoin several places i was held up by passages requiring a key eventually from various allusions i gathered that old claes had not dared to embody all his knowledge in one book but had left certain points for another neither volume can be wholly intelligible without its fellow hence i have resolved to find the second one if it lies anywhere within this accursed house though plainly a prisoner i have not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown and am determined to probe the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comesapril 23searched all the morning for the second diary and found it about noon in a desk in the little locked room like the first it is in claes van der heyls barbarous latin and it seems to consist of disjointed notes referring to various sections of the other glancing through the leaves i spied at once the abhorred name of yianhoof yianho that lost and hidden city wherein brood aeonold secrets and of which dim memories older than the body lurk behind the minds of all men it was repeated many times and the text around it was strown with crudely drawn hieroglyphs plainly akin to those on the pedestal in that hellish drawing i had seen here clearly lay the key to that monstrous tentacled shape and its forbidden message with this knowledge i ascended the creaking stairs to the attic of cobwebs and horrorwhen i tried to open the attic door it stuck as never before several times it resisted every effort to open it and when at last it gave way i had a distinct feeling that some colossal unseen shape had suddenly released ita shape that soared away on nonmaterial but audibly beating wings when i found the horrible drawing i felt that it was not precisely where i had left it applying the key in the other book i soon saw that the latter was no instant guide to the secret it was only a cluea clue to a secret too black to be left lightly guarded it would take hoursperhaps daysto extract the awful messageshall i live long enough to learn the secret the shadowy black arms and paws haunt my vision more and more now and seem even more titanic than at first nor am i ever long free from those vague unhuman presences whose nebulous bulk seems too vast for the chambers to contain and now and then the grotesque evanescent faces and forms and the mocking portraitshapes troop before me in bewildering confusiontruly there are terrible primal arcana of earth which had better be left unknown and unevoked dread secrets which have nothing to do with man and which man may learn only in exchange for peace and sanity cryptic truths which make the knower evermore an alien among his kind and cause him to walk alone on earth likewise are there dread survivals of things older and more potent than man things that have blasphemously straggled down through the aeons to ages never meant for them monstrous entities that have lain sleeping endlessly in incredible crypts and remote caverns outside the laws of reason and causation and ready to be waked by such blasphemers as shall know their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwordsapril 24studied the picture and the key all day in the attic at sunset i heard strange sounds of a sort not encountered before and seeming to come from far away listening i realised that they must flow from that queer abrupt hill with the circle of standing stones which lies behind the village and some distance north of the house i had heard that there was a path from the house leading up that hill to the primal cromlech and had suspected that at certain seasons the van der heyls had much occasion to use it but the whole matter had hitherto lain latent in my consciousness the present sounds consisted of a shrill piping intermingled with a peculiar and hideous sort of hissing or whistlinga bizarre alien kind of music like nothing which the annals of earth describe it was very faint and soon faded but the matter has set me thinking it is toward the hill that the long northerly ell with the secret chute and the locked brick vault under it extend can there be any connexion which has so far eluded meapril 25i have made a peculiar and disturbing discovery about the nature of my imprisonment drawn toward the hill by a sinister fascination i found the briers giving way before mebut in that direction onlythere is a ruined gate and beneath the bushes the traces of the old path no doubt exist the briers extend part way up and all around the hill though the summit with the standing stones bears only a curious growth of moss and stunted grass i climbed the hill and spent several hours there noticing a strange wind which seems always to sweep around the forbidding monoliths and which sometimes seems to whisper in an oddly articulate though darkly cryptic fashionthese stones both in colour and in texture resemble nothing i have seen elsewhere they are neither brown nor grey but rather of a dirty yellow merging into an evil green and having a suggestion of chameleonlike variability their texture is queerly like that of a scaled serpent and is inexplicably nauseous to the touchbeing as cold and clammy as the skin of a toad or other reptile near the central menhir is a singular stonerimmed hollow which i cannot explain but which may possibly form the entrance to a longchoked well or tunnel when i sought to descend the hill at points away from the house i found the briers intercepting me as before though the path toward the house was easily retraceableapril 26up on the hill again this evening and found that windy whispering much more distinct the almost angry humming came close to actual speechof a vague sibilant sortand reminded me of the strange piping chant i had heard from afar after sunset there came a curious flash of premature summer lightning on the northern horizon followed almost at once by a queer detonation high in the fading sky something about this phenomenon disturbed me greatly and i could not escape the impression that the noise ended in a kind of unhuman hissing speech which trailed off into guttural cosmic laughter is my mind tottering at last or has my unwarranted curiosity evoked unheardof horrors from the twilight spaces the sabbat is close at hand now what will be the endapril 27at last my dreams are to be realised whether or not my life or spirit or body will be claimed i shall enter the gateway progress in deciphering those crucial hieroglyphs in the picture has been slow but this afternoon i hit upon the final clue by evening i knew their meaningand that meaning can apply in only one way to the things i have encountered in this housethere is beneath this housesepulchred i know not wherean ancient forgotten one who will shew me the gateway i would enter and give me the lost signs and words i shall need how long it has lain buried hereforgotten save by those who reared the stones on the hill and by those who later sought out this place and built this housei cannot conjecture it was in search of this thing beyond question that hendrik van der heyl came to newnetherland in 1638 men of this earth know it not save in the secret whispers of the fearshaken few who have found or inherited the key no human eye has even yet glimpsed itunless perhaps the vanished wizards of this house delved farther than has been guessedwith knowledge of the symbols came likewise a mastery of the seven lost signs of terrorand a tacit recognition of the hideous and unutterable words of fear all that remains for me to accomplish is the chant which will transfigure that forgotten one who is guardian of the ancient gateway i marvel much at the chant it is composed of strange and repellent gutturals and disturbing sibilants resembling no language i have ever encounteredeven in the blackest chapters of thelivre deibonwhen i visited the hill at sunset i tried to read it aloud but evoked in response only a vague sinister rumbling on the far horizon and a thin cloud of elemental dust that writhed and whirled like some evil living thing perhaps i do not pronounce the alien syllables correctly or perhaps it is only on the sabbatthat hellish sabbat for which the powers in this house are without question holding methat the great transfiguration can occurhad an odd spell of fright this morning i thought for a moment that i recalled where i had seen that baffling name of sleght before and the prospect of realisation filled me with unutterable horrorapril 28today dark ominous clouds have hovered intermittently over the circle on the hill i have noticed such clouds several times before but their contours and arrangements now hold a fresh significance they are snakelike and fantastic and curiously like the evil shadowshapes i have seen in the house they float in a circle around the primal cromlechrevolving repeatedly as though endowed with a sinister life and purpose i could swear too that they give forth an angry murmuring after some fifteen minutes they sail slowly away ever to the eastward like the units of a straggling battalion are they indeed those dread ones whom solomon knew of oldthose giant black beings whose number is legion and whose tread doth shake the earthi have been rehearsing the chant that will transfigure the nameless thing yet strange fears assail me even when i utter the syllables under my breath piecing all evidence together i have now discovered that the only way to it is through the locked cellar vault that vault was built with a hellish purpose and must cover the hidden burrow leading to the immemorial lair what guardians live endlessly within flourishing from century to century on an unknown nourishment only the mad may conjecture the warlocks of this house who called them out of inner earth have known them only too well as the shocking portraits and memories of the place revealwhat troubles me most is the limited nature of the chant it evokes the nameless one yet provides no method for the control of that which is evoked there are of course the general signs and gestures but whether they will prove effective toward such an one remains to be seen still the rewards are great enough to justify any dangerand i could not retreat if i would since an unknown force plainly urges me oni have discovered one more obstacle since the locked cellar vault must be traversed the key to that place must be found the lock is infinitely too strong for forcing that the key is somewhere hereabouts cannot be doubted but the time before the sabbat is very short i must search diligently and thoroughly it will take courage to unlock that iron door for what prisoned horrors may not lurk withinlateri have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two but late this afternoon i again descended to those forbidding precincts at first all was silent but within five minutes the menacing padding and muttering began once more beyond the iron door this time it was loud and more terrifying than on any previous occasion and i likewise recognised the slithering that bespoke some monstrous seabeastnow swifter and nervously intensified as if the thing were striving to force its way through the portal to where i stoodas the pacing grew louder more restless and more sinister there began to pound through it those hellish and unidentifiable reverberations which i had heard on my second visit to the cellarthose muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder now however their volume was magnified an hundredfold and their timbre freighted with new and terrifying implications i can compare the sound to nothing more aptly than to the roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age when primal horrors roamed the earth and valusias serpentmen laid the foundationstones of evil magic to such a roarbut swelled to deafening heights reached by no known organic throatwas this shocking sound akin dare i unlock the door and face the onslaught of what lies beyondapril 29the key to the vault is found i came upon it this noon in the little locked roomburied beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk as if some belated effort to conceal it had been made it was wrapped in a crumbling newspaper dated oct 31 1872 but there was an inner wrapping of dried skinevidently the hide of some unknown reptilewhich bore a low latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of the notebooks i found as i had thought the lock and key were vastly older than the vault old claes van der heyl had them ready for something he or his descendants meant to doand how much older than he they were i could not estimate deciphering the latin message i trembled in a fresh access of clutching terror and nameless awethe secrets of the monstrous primal ones ran the crabbed text whose cryptic words relate the hidden things that were before man the things no one of earth should learn lest peace be forever forfeited shall by me never suffer revelation to yianho that lost and forbidden city of countless aeons whose place may not be told i have been in the veritable flesh of this body as none other among the living has been therein have i found and thence have i borne away that knowledge which i would gladly lose though i may not i have learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged and must call out of the earth that which should not be waked or called and what is sent to follow me will not sleep till i or those after me have found and done what is to be found and donethat which i have awaked and borne away with me i may not part with again so is it written in the book of hidden things that which i have willed to be has twined its dreadful shape around me andif i live not to do the biddingaround those children born and unborn who shall come after me until the bidding be done strange may be their joinings and awful the aid they may summon till the end be reached into lands unknown and dim must the seeking go and a house must be built for the outer guardiansthis is the key to that lock which was given me in the dreadful aeonold and forbidden city of yianho the lock which i or mine must place upon the vestibule of that which is to be found and may the lords of yaddith succour meor himwho must set that lock in place or turn the key thereofsuch was the messagea message which once i had read it i seemed to have known before now as i write these words the key is before me i gaze on it with mixed dread and longing and cannot find words to describe its aspect it is of the same unknown subtly greenish frosted metal as the lock a metal best compared to brass tarnished with verdigris its design is alien and fantastic and the coffinshaped end of the ponderous bulk leaves no doubt of the lock it was meant to fit the handle roughly forms a strange nonhuman image whose exact outlines and identity cannot now be traced upon holding it for any length of time i seem to feel an alien anomalouslifein the cold metala quickening or pulsing too feeble for ordinary recognition below the eidolon is graven a faint aeonworn legend in those blasphemous chineselike hieroglyphs i have come to know so well i can make out only the beginningthe words my vengeance lurksbefore the text fades to indistinctness there is some fatality in this timely finding of the keyfor tomorrow night comes the hellish sabbatbut strangely enough amidst all this hideous expectancy that question of the sleght name bothers me more and more why should i dread to find it linked with the van der heylswalpurgiseveapril 30the time has come i waked last night to see the sky glowing with a lurid greenish radiancethat same morbid green which i have seen in the eyes and skin of certain portraits here on the shocking lock and key on the monstrous menhirs of the hill and in a thousand other recesses of my consciousness there were strident whispers in the airsibilant whistlings like those of the wind around that dreadful cromlech something spoke to me out of the frore aether of space and it said the hour falls it is an omen and i laugh at my own fears have i not the dread words and the seven lost signs of terrorthe power coercive of any dweller in the cosmos or in the unknown darkened spaces i will no longer hesitatethe heavens are very dark as if a terrific storm were coming ona storm even greater than that of the night when i reached here nearly a fortnight ago from the villageless than a mile awayi hear a queer and unwonted babbling it is as i thoughtthese poor degraded idiots are within the secret and keep the awful sabbat on the hill here in the house the shadows gather densely in the darkness the key before me almost glows with a greenish light of its own i have not yet been to the cellar it is better that i wait lest the sound of that muttering and paddingthose slitherings and muffled reverberationsunnerve me before i can unlock the fateful doorof what i shall encounter and what i must do i have only the mostgeneralidea shall i find my task in the vault itself or must i burrow deeper into the nighted heart of our planet there are things i do not yet understandor at least prefer not to understanddespite a dreadful increasing and inexplicable sense of bygone familiarity with this fearsome house that chute for instance leading down from the little locked room but i think i know why the wing with the vault extends toward the hill6 pmlooking out the north windows i can see a group of villagers on the hill they seem unaware of the lowering sky and are digging near the great central menhir it occurs to me that they are working on that stonerimmed hollow place which looks like a longchoked tunnel entrance what is to come how much of the olden sabbat rites have these people retained that key glows horriblyit is not

i awoke abruptly from a horrible dream and stared wildly about then seeing the high arched ceiling and the narrow stained windows of my friends room a flood of uneasy revelation coursed over me and i knew that all of andrews hopes had been realized i lay supine in a large bed the posts of which reared upward in dizzy perspective while on vast shelves about the chamber were the familiar books and antiques i was accustomed to seeing in that secluded corner of the crumbling and ancient mansion which had formed our joint home for many years on a table by the wall stood a huge candelabrum of early workmanship and design and the usual light windowcurtains had been replaced by hangings of somber black which took on a faint ghostly luster in the dying lighti recalled forcibly the events preceding my confinement and seclusion in this veritable medieval fortress they were not pleasant and i shuddered anew when i remembered the couch that had held me before my tenancy of the present onethe couch that everyone supposed would be my last memory burned afresh regarding those hideous circumstances which had compelled me to choose between a true death and a hypothetical onewith a later reanimation by therapeutic methods known only to my comrade marshall andrews the whole thing had begun when i returned from the orient a year before and discovered to my utter horror that i had contracted leprosy while abroad i had known that i was taking grave chances in caring for my stricken brother in the philippines but no hint of my own affliction appeared until i returned to my native land andrews himself had made the discovery and kept it from me as long as possible but our close acquaintance soon disclosed the awful truthat once i was quartered in our ancient abode atop the crags overlooking crumbling hampden from whose musty halls and quaint arched doorways i was never permitted to go forth it was a terrible existence with the yellow shadow hanging constantly over me yet my friend never faltered in his faith taking care not to contract the dread scourge but meanwhile making life as pleasant and comfortable as possible his widespread though somewhat sinister fame as a surgeon prevented any authority from discovering my plight and shipping me awayit was after nearly a year of this seclusionlate in augustthat andrews decided on a trip to the west indiesto study native medical methods he said i was left in care of venerable simes the household factotum so far no outward signs of the disease had developed and i enjoyed a tolerable though almost completely private existence during my colleagues absence it was during this time that i read many of the tomes andrews had acquired in the course of his twenty years as a surgeon and learned why his reputation though locally of the highest was just a bit shady for the volumes included any number of fanciful subjects hardly related to modern medical knowledge treatises and unauthoritative articles on monstrous experiments in surgery accounts of the bizarre effects of glandular transplantation and rejuvenation in animals and men alike brochures on attempted brain transference and a host of other fanatical speculations not countenanced by orthodox physicians it appeared too that andrews was an authority on obscure medicaments some of the few books i waded through revealing that he had spent much time in chemistry and in the search for new drugs which might be used as aids in surgery looking back at those studies now i find them hellishly suggestive when associated with his later experimentsandrews was gone longer than i expected returning early in november almost four months later and when he did arrive i was quite anxious to see him since my condition was at last on the brink of becoming noticeable i had reached a point where i must seek absolute privacy to keep from being discovered but my anxiety was slight as compared with his exuberance over a certain new plan he had hatched while in the indiesa plan to be carried out with the aid of a curious drug he had learned of from a native doctor in haiti when he explained that his idea concerned me i became somewhat alarmed though in my position there could be little to make my plight worse i had indeed considered more than once the oblivion that would come with a revolver or a plunge from the roof to the jagged rocks belowon the day after his arrival in the seclusion of the dimly lit study he outlined the whole grisly scheme he had found in haiti a drug the formula for which he would develop later which induced a state of profound sleep in anyone taking it a trance so deep that death was closely counterfeitedwith all muscular reflexes even the respiration and heartbeat completely stilled for the time being andrews had he said seen it demonstrated on natives many times some of them remained somnolent for days at a time wholly immobile and as much like death as death itself this suspended animation he explained further would even pass the closest examination of any medical man he himself according to all known laws would have to report as dead a man under the influence of such a drug he stated too that the subjects body assumed the precise appearance of a corpseeven a slightrigor mortisdeveloping in prolonged casesfor some time his purpose did not seem wholly clear but when the full import of his words became apparent i felt weak and nauseated yet in another way i was relieved for the thing meant at least a partial escape from my curse an escape from the banishment and shame of an ordinary death of the dread leprosy briefly his plan was to administer a strong dose of the drug to me and call the local authorities who would immediately pronounce me dead and see that i was buried within a very short while he felt assured that with their careless examination they would fail to notice my leprosy symptoms which in truth had hardly appeared only a trifle over fifteen months had passed since i had caught the disease whereas the corruption takes seven years to run its entire courselater he said would come resurrection after my interment in the family graveyardbeside my centuried dwelling and barely a quartermile from his own ancient pilethe appropriate steps would be taken finally when my estate was settled and my decease widely known he would secretly open the tomb and bring me to his own abode again still alive and none the worse for my adventure it seemed a ghastly and daring plan but to me it offered the only hope for even a partial freedom so i accepted his proposition but not without a myriad of misgivings what if the effect of the drug should wear off while i was in my tomb what if the coroner should discover the awful ruse and fail to inter me these were some of the hideous doubts which assailed me before the experiment though death would have been a release from my curse i feared it even worse than the yellow scourge feared it even when i could see its black wings constantly hovering over mefortunately i was spared the horror of viewing my own funeral and burial rites they must however have gone just as andrews had planned even to the subsequent disinterment for after the initial dose of the poison from haiti i lapsed into a semiparalytic state and from that to a profound nightblack sleep the drug had been administered in my room and andrews had told me before giving it that he would recommend to the coroner a verdict of heart failure due to nerve strain of course there was no embalmingandrews saw to thatand the whole procedure leading up to my secret transportation from the graveyard to his crumbling manor covered a period of three days having been buried late in the afternoon of the third day my body was secured by andrews that very night he had replaced the fresh sod just as it had been when the workmen left old simes sworn to secrecy had helped andrews in his ghoulish tasklater i had lain for over a week in my old familiar bed owing to some unexpected effect of the drug my whole body was completely paralyzed so that i could move my head only slightly all my senses however were fully alert and by another weeks time i was able to take nourishment in good quantities andrews explained that my body would gradually regain its former sensibilities though owing to the presence of the leprosy it might take considerable time he seemed greatly interested in analyzing my daily symptoms and always asked if there was any feeling present in my bodymany days passed before i was able to control any part of my anatomy and much longer before the paralysis crept from my enfeebled limbs so that i could feel the ordinary bodily reactions lying and staring at my numb hulk was like having it injected with a perpetual anesthetic there was a total alienation i could not understand considering that my head and neck were quite alive and in good healthandrews explained that he had revived my upper half first and could not account for the complete bodily paralysis though my condition seemed to trouble him little considering the damnably intent interest he centered upon my reactions and stimuli from the very beginning many times during lulls in our conversation i would catch a strange gleam in his eyes as he viewed me on the coucha glint of victorious exultation which queerly enough he never voiced aloud though he seemed to be quite glad that i had run the gauntlet of death and had come through alive still there was that horror i was to meet in less than six years which added to my desolation and melancholy during the tedious days in which i awaited the return of normal bodily functions but i would be up and about he assured me before very long enjoying an existence few men had ever experienced the words did not however impress me with their true and ghastly meaning until many days laterduring that awful siege in bed andrews and i became somewhat estranged he no longer treated me so much like a friend as like an implement in his skilled and greedy fingers i found him possessed of unexpected traitslittle examples of baseness and cruelty apparent even to the hardened simes which disturbed me in a most unusual manner often he would display extraordinary cruelty to live specimens in his laboratory for he was constantly carrying on various hidden projects in glandular and muscular transplantation on guineapigs and rabbits he had also been employing his newly discovered sleepingpotion in curious experiments with suspended animation but of these things he told me very little though old simes often let slip chance comments which shed some light on the proceedings i was not certain how much the old servant knew but he had surely learned considerable being a constant companion to both andrews and myselfwith the passage of time a slow but consistent feeling began creeping into my disabled body and at the reviving symptoms andrews took a fanatical interest in my case he still seemed more coldly analytical than sympathetic toward me taking my pulse and heartbeat with more than usual zeal occasionally in his fevered examinations i saw his hands tremble slightlyan uncommon sight with so skilled a surgeonbut he seemed oblivious of my scrutiny i was never allowed even a momentary glimpse of my full body but with the feeble return of the sense of touch i was aware of a bulk and heaviness which at first seemed awkward and unfamiliargradually i regained the use of my hands and arms and with the passing of the paralysis came a new and terrible sensation of physical estrangement my limbs had difficulty in following the commands of my mind and every movement was jerky and uncertain so clumsy were my hands that i had to become accustomed to them all over again this must i thought be due to my disease and the advance of the contagion in my system being unaware of how the early symptoms affected the victim my brothers being a more advanced case i had no means of judging and since andrews shunned the subject i deemed it better to remain silentone day i asked andrewsi no longer considered him a friendif i might try rising and sitting up in bed at first he objected strenuously but later after cautioning me to keep the blankets well up around my chin so that i would not be chilled he permitted it this seemed strange in view of the comfortable temperature now that late autumn was slowly turning into winter the room was always well heated a growing chilliness at night and occasional glimpses of a leaden sky through the window had told me of the changing season for no calendar was ever in sight upon the dingy walls with the gentle help of simes i was eased to a sitting position andrews coldly watching from the door to the laboratory at my success a slow smile spread across his leering features and he turned to disappear from the darkened doorway his mood did nothing to improve my condition old simes usually so regular and consistent was now often late in his duties sometimes leaving me alone for hours at a timethe terrible sense of alienation was heightened by my new position it seemed that the legs and arms inside my gown were hardly able to follow the summoning of my mind and it became mentally exhausting to continue movement for any length of time my fingers woefully clumsy were wholly unfamiliar to my inner sense of touch and i wondered vaguely if i were to be accursed the rest of my days with an awkwardness induced by my dread maladyit was on the evening following my halfrecovery that the dreams began i was tormented not only at night but during the day as well i would awaken screaming horribly from some frightful nightmare i dared not think about outside the realm of sleep these dreams consisted mainly of ghoulish things graveyards at night stalking corpses and lost souls amid a chaos of blinding light and shadow the terriblerealityof the visions disturbed me most of all it seemed that someinsideinfluence was inducing the grisly vistas of moonlit tombstones and endless catacombs of the restless dead i could not place their source and at the end of a week i was quite frantic with abominable thoughts which seemed to obtrude themselves upon my unwelcome consciousnessby that time a slow plan was forming whereby i might escape the living hell into which i had been propelled andrews cared less and less about me seeming intent only on my progress and growth and recovery of normal muscular reactions i was becoming every day more convinced of the nefarious doings going on in that laboratory across the thresholdthe animal cries were shocking and rasped hideously on my overwrought nerves and i was gradually beginning to think that andrews had not saved me from deportation solely for my own benefit but for some accursed reason of his own simess attention was slowly becoming slighter and slighter and i was convinced that the aged servitor had a hand in the deviltry somewhere andrews no longer eyed me as a friend but as an object of experimentation nor did i like the way he fingered his scalpel when he stood in the narrow doorway and stared at me with crafty alertness i had never before seen such a transformation come over any man his ordinarily handsome features were now lined and whiskergrown and his eyes gleamed as if some imp of satan were staring from them his cold calculating gaze made me shudder horribly and gave me a fresh determination to free myself from his bondage as soon as possiblei had lost track of time during my dreamorgy and had no way of knowing how fast the days were passing the curtains were often drawn in the daytime the room being lit by waxen cylinders in the large candelabrum it was a nightmare of living horror and unreality though through it all i was gradually becoming stronger i always gave careful responses to andrews inquiries concerning my returning physical control concealing the fact that a new life was vibrating through me with every passing dayan altogether strange sort of strength but one which i was counting on to serve me in the coming crisisfinally one chilly evening when the candles had been extinguished and a pale shaft of moonlight fell through the dark curtains upon my bed i determined to rise and carry out my plan of action there had been no movement from either of my captors for several hours and i was confident that both were asleep in adjoining bedchambers shifting my cumbersome weight carefully i rose to a sitting position and crawled cautiously out of bed down upon the floor a vertigo gripped me momentarily and a wave of weakness flooded my entire being but finally strength returned and by clutching at a bedpost i was able to stand upon my feet for the first time in many months gradually a new strength coursed through me and i donned the dark robe which i had seen hanging on a nearby chair it was quite long but served as a cloak over my nightdress again came that feeling of awful unfamiliarity which i had experienced in bed that sense of alienation and of difficulty in making my limbs perform as they should but there was need for haste before my feeble strength might give out as a last precaution in dressing i slipped some old shoes over my feet but though i could have sworn they were my own they seemed abnormally loose so that i decided they must belong to the aged simesseeing no other heavy objects in the room i seized from the table the huge candelabrum upon which the moon shone with a pallid glow and proceeded very quietly toward the laboratory doormy first steps came jerkily and with much difficulty and in the semidarkness i was unable to make my way very rapidly when i reached the threshold a glance within revealed my former friend seated in a large overstuffed chair while beside him was a smokingstand upon which were assorted bottles and a glass he reclined halfway in the moonlight through the large window and his greasy features were creased in a drunken smirk an opened book lay in his lapone of the hideous tomes from his private libraryfor a long moment i gloated over the prospect before me and then stepping forward suddenly i brought the heavy weapon down upon his unprotected head the dull crunch was followed by a spurt of blood and the fiend crumpled to the floor his head laid half open i felt no contrition at taking the mans life in such a manner in the hideous halfvisible specimens of his surgical wizardry scattered about the room in various stages of completion and preservation i felt there was enough evidence to blast his soul without my aid andrews had gone too far in his practices to continue living and as one of his monstrous specimensof that i was now hideously certainit was my duty to exterminate himsimes i realized would be no such easy matter indeed only unusual good fortune had caused me to find andrews unconscious when i finally reeled up to the servants bedchamber door faint from exhaustion i knew it would take all my remaining strength to complete the ordealthe old mans room was in utmost darkness being on the north side of the structure but he must have seen me silhouetted in the doorway as i came in he screamed hoarsely and i aimed the candelabrum at him from the threshold it struck something soft making a sloughing sound in the darkness but the screaming continued from that time on events became hazy and jumbled together but i remember grappling with the man and choking the life from him little by little he gibbered a host of awful things before i could lay hands on himcried and begged for mercy from my clutching fingers i hardly realized my own strength in that mad moment which left andrews associate in a condition like his ownretreating from the darkened chamber i stumbled for the stairway door sagged through it and somehow reached the landing below no lamps were burning and my only light was a filtering of moonbeams coming from the narrow windows in the hall but i made my jerky way over the cold damp slabs of stone reeling from the terrible weakness of my exertion and reached the front door after ages of fumbling and crawling about in the darknessvague memories and haunting shadows came to taunt me in that ancient hallway shadows once friendly and understandable but now grown alien and unrecognizable so that i stumbled down the worn steps in a frenzy of something more than fear for a moment i stood in the shadow of the giant stone manor viewing the moonlit trail down which i must go to reach the home of my forefathers only a quarter of a mile distant but the way seemed long and for a while i despaired of ever traversing the whole of itat last i grasped a piece of dead wood as a cane and set out down the winding road ahead seemingly only a few rods away in the moonlight stood the venerable mansion where my ancestors had lived and died its turrets rose spectrally in the shimmering radiance and the black shadow cast on the beetling hillside appeared to shift and waver as if belonging to a castle of unreal substance there stood the monument of half a century a haven for all my family old and young which i had deserted many years ago to live with the fanatical andrews it stood empty on that fateful night and i hope that it may always remain soin some manner i reached the aged place though i do not remember the last half of the journey at all it was enough to be near the family cemetery among whose mosscovered and crumbling stones i would seek the oblivion i had desired as i approached the moonlit spot the old familiarityso absent during my abnormal existencereturned to plague me in a wholly unexpected way i drew close to my own tombstone and the feeling of homecoming grew stronger with it came a fresh flood of that awful sense of alienation and disembodiment which i knew so well i was satisfied that the end was drawing near nor did i stop to analyze emotions till a little later when the full horror of my position burst upon meintuitively i knew my own tombstone for the grass had scarcely begun to grow between the pieces of sod with feverish haste i began clawing at the mound and scraping the wet earth from the hole left by the removal of the grass and roots how long i worked in the nitrous soil before my fingers struck the coffinlid i can never say but sweat was pouring from me and my nails were but useless bleeding hooksat last i threw out the last bit of loose earth and with trembling fingers tugged on the heavy lid it gave a trifle and i was prepared to lift it completely open when a fetid and nauseous odor assailed my nostrils i started erect horrified had some idiot placed my tombstone on the wrong grave causing me to unearth another body for surely there could be no mistaking that awful stench gradually a hideous uncertainty came over me and i scrambled from the hole one look at the newly made headpiece was enough this was indeed my own grave but what fool had buried within it another corpseall at once a bit of the unspeakable truth propelled itself upon my brain the odor in spite of its putrescence seemed somehow familiarhorriblyfamiliar yet i could not credit my senses with such an idea reeling and cursing i fell into the black cavity once more and by the aid of a hastily lit match lifted the long lid completely open then the light went out as if extinguished by a malignant hand and i clawed my way out of that accursed pit screaming in a frenzy of fear and loathingwhen i regained consciousness i was lying before the door of my own ancient manor where i must have crawled after that hideous rendezvous in the family cemetery i realized that dawn was close at hand and rose feebly opening the aged portal before me and entering the place which had known no footsteps for over a decade a fever was ravaging my weakened body so that i was hardly able to stand but i made my way slowly through the musty dimly lit chambers and staggered into my own studythe study i had deserted so many years beforewhen the sun has risen i shall go to the ancient well beneath the old willow tree by the cemetery and cast my deformedselfinto it no other man shall ever view this blasphemy which has survived life longer than it should have i do not know what people will say when they see my disordered grave but this will not trouble me if i can find oblivion from that which i beheld amidst the crumbling mosscrusted stones of the hideous placei know now why andrews was so secretive in his actions so damnably gloating in his attitude toward me after my artificial death he had meant me for a specimen all the timea specimen of his greatest feat of surgery his masterpiece of unclean witchery an example of perverted artistry for him alone to see where andrews obtained thatotherwith which i lay accursed in his moldering mansion i shall probably never know but i am afraid that it was brought from haiti along with his fiendish medicine at least these long hairy arms and horrible short legs are alien to me alien to all natural and sane laws of mankind the thought that i shall be tortured with thatotherduring the rest of my brief existence is another hellnow i can but wish for that which once was mine that which every man blessed of god ought to have at death that which i saw in that awful moment in the ancient burial ground when i raised the lid on the coffinmy own shrunken decayed and headless body,1
there is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream and out of which no stream flows ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath but sarnath stands there no moreit is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar another city stood beside the lake the grey stone city of ib which was old as the lake itself and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold very odd and ugly were these beings as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned it is written on the brick cylinders of kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it that they had bulging eyes pouting flabby lips and curious ears and were without voice it is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist they and the vast still lake and grey stone city ib however this may be it is certain that they worshipped a seagreen stone idol chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the great waterlizard before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous and it is written in the papyrus of ilarnek that they one day discovered fire and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions but not much is written of these beings because they lived in very ancient times and man is young and knows little of the very ancient living thingsafter many aeons men came to the land of mnar dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks who built thraa ilarnek and kadatheron on the winding river ai and certain tribes more hardy than the rest pushed on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earthnot far from the grey city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath and at the beings of ib they marvelled greatly but with their marvelling was mixed hate for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the grey monoliths of ib for those sculptures were terrible with great antiquity why the beings and the sculptures lingered so late in the world even until the coming of men none can tell unless it was because the land of mnar is very still and remote from most other lands both of waking and of dreamas the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew and it was not less because they found the beings weak and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and spears and arrows so one day the young warriors the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen marched against ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears because they did not wish to touch them and because they did not like the grey sculptured monoliths of ib they cast these also into the lake wondering from the greatness of the labour how ever the stones were brought from afar as they must have been since there is naught like them in all the land of mnar or in the lands adjacentthus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared save the seagreen stone idol chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the waterlizard this the young warriors took back with them to sarnath as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of ib and a sign of leadership in mnar but on the night after it was set up in the temple a terrible thing must have happened for weird lights were seen over the lake and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the highpriest taranish lying dead as from some fear unspeakable and before he died taranish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doomafter taranish there were many highpriests in sarnath but never was the seagreen stone idol found and many centuries came and went wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly so that only priests and old women remembered what taranish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan route and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river ai and beyond so sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighbouring cities and in time there sate upon a throne in sarnath the kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacentthe wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the magnificent of polished desertquarried marble were its walls in height 300 cubits and in breadth 75 so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top for full 500 stadia did they run being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone seawall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib in sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans and fifty more intersecting them with onyx were they paved save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod which were paved with granite and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets each of bronze and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men the houses of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet with strange art were they builded for no other city had houses like them and travellers from thraa and ilarnek and kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmountedbut more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples and the gardens made by zokkar the olden king there were many palaces the least of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder many were the pillars of the palaces all of tinted marble and carven into designs of surpassing beauty and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapislazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers and there were likewise fountains which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of the lands adjacent on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne many steps above the gleaming floor and it was wrought of one piece of ivory though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come in that palace there were also many galleries and many amphitheatres where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings sometimes the amphitheatres were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts and then were enacted stirring seafights or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine thingslofty and amazing were the seventeen towerlike temples of sarnath fashioned of a bright multicoloured stone not known elsewhere a full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them wherein the highpriests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces where gathered throngs in worship of zokalar and tamash and lobon the chief gods of sarnath whose incenseenveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs not like the eikons of other gods were those of zokalar and tamash and lobon for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones and up unending steps of shining zircon was the towerchamber wherefrom the highpriests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets and their reflections in the lake by night here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug the waterlizard and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the doomscrawl of taranishwonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king in the centre of sarnath they lay covering a great space and encircled by a high wall and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass through which shone the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was clear and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear in summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans and in winter they were heated with concealed fires so that in those gardens it was always spring there ran little streams over bright pebbles dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues and spanned by a multitude of bridges many were the waterfalls in their courses and many were the lilied lakelets into which they expanded over the streams and lakelets rode white swans whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters in ordered terraces rose the green banks adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms and seats and benches of marble and porphyry and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small godseach year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying of ib at which time wine song dancing and merriment of every kind abounded great honours were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of zokkar and the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it at first the highpriests liked not these festivals for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the seagreen eikon had vanished and how taranish had died from fear and left a warning and they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake but as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters indeed had they not themselves in their high tower often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug the waterlizard and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath wonder of the world and pride of all mankindgorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of ib for a decade had it been talked of in the land of mnar and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from thraa ilarnek and kadatheron and all the cities of mnar and the lands beyond before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers within his banquethall reclined nargishei the king drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnath and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast peacocks from the isles of nariel in the middle ocean young goats from the distant hills of implan heels of camels from the bnazic desert nuts and spices from cydathrian groves and pearls from wavewashed mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa of sauces there were an untold number prepared by the subtlest cooks in all mnar and suited to the palate of every feaster but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake each of vast size and served up on golden platters set with rubies and diamondswhilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters others feasted elsewhere in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighbouring lands made merry and it was the highpriest gnaikah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water and saw that the grey rock akurion which was wont to rear high above it near the shore was almost submerged and fear grew vaguely yet swiftly so that the princes of ilarnek and of far rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed for the river ai though they scarce knew the reason for their departingthen close to the hour of midnight all the bronze gates of sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the kings banquethall where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of nargishei and his nobles and slaves but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes pouting flabby lips and curious ears things which danced horribly bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds containing uncouth flames and the princes and travellers as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and camels and elephants looked again upon the mistbegetting lake and saw the grey rock akurion was quite submergedthrough all the land of mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more it was long ere any traveller went thither and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of distant falona dared make the journey adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes who are no kin to the men of mnar these men indeed went to the lake to view sarnath but though they found the vast still lake itself and the grey rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind where once had risen walls of 300 cubits and towers yet higher now stretched only the marshy shore and where once had dwelt fifty millions of men now crawled only the detestable green waterlizard not even the mines of precious metal remained for doom had come to sarnathbut half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol of stone an exceedingly ancient idol coated with seaweed and chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the great waterlizard that idol enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of mnar,1
three times randolph carter dreamed of the marvellous city and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset with walls temples colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble silverbasined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossomladen urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles it was a fever of the gods a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain and as carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almostvanished memory the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had an awesome and momentous placehe knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it or whether in dream or in waking he could not tell vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetick to the eager sound of lutes and song unclosing faery gates toward further and surprising marvels but each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dreams tyrannous gods for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot or descend the wide marmoreal flights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoningwhen for the third time he awaked with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath in the cold waste where no man treads but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests nasht and kamanthah whose caverntemple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world it seemed however that his prayers must have been adversely heard for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights and against some hidden plan or wish of the godsat length sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown kadath veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the great onesin light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and kamanthah and the priests shook their pshentbearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul they pointed out that the great ones had shewn already their wish and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas they reminded him too that not only had no man ever been to unknown kadath but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie whether it be in the dreamlands around our world or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or aldebaran if in our dreamland it might conceivably be reached but only three fully human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands and of that three two had come back quite mad there were in such voyages incalculable local dangers as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe where no dreams reach that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinitythe boundless daemonsultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods the blind voiceless tenebrous mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotepof these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and kamanthah in the cavern of flame but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown kadath in the cold waste wherever that might be and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city he knew that his journey would be strange and long and that the great ones would be against it but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him so asking a farewell blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted woodin the tunnels of that twisted wood whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs who know many obscure secrets of the dreamworld and a few of the waking world since the wood at two places touches the lands of men though it would be disastrous to say where certain unexplained rumours events and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dream but over the nearer parts of the dreamworld they pass freely flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love most of them live in burrows but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat either physical or spiritual for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out carter however had no fear for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them having found through their help the splendid city of celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where reigns half the year the great king kuranes a man he had known by another name in life kuranes was the one soul who had been to the stargulfs and returned free from madnessthreading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs and listened now and then for responses he remembered one particular village of the creatures near the centre of the wood where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten and toward this spot he hastened he traced his way by the grotesque fungi which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed finally the greater light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight this was the nearest of the great ring of stones and carter knew he was close to the zoog village renewing his fluttering sound he waited patiently and was at length rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him it was the zoogs for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small slippery brown outlinesout they swarmed from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree till the whole dimlitten region was alive with them some of the wilder ones brushed carter unpleasantly and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders the council of sages recognising the visitor offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon and as carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began the zoogs did not unfortunately know where the peak of kadath lies nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dreamworld or in another rumours of the great ones came equally from all points and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneaththen one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheardof by the others and said that in ulthar beyond the river skai there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame manytempled olatho and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar those manuscripts he said told much of the gods and besides in ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight he had failed though his companion had succeeded and perished namelesslyso randolph carter thanked the zoogs who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of moontree wine to take with him and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side where the rushing skai flows down from the slopes of lerion and hatheg and nir and ulthar dot the plain behind him furtive and unseen crept several of the curious zoogs for they wished to learn what might befall him and bear back the legend to their people the vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers there he would turn sharply aside for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks and what it was possibly set up for the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberatelycarter detoured at the proper place and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs he had known they would follow him so he was not disturbed for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures it was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning over fertile plains rolling down to the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind at another house where people were stirring he asked questions about the gods and whether they danced often upon lerion but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and tell him the way to nir and ultharat noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the skai into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteenhundred years before once on the other side the frequent presence of cats who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs revealed the near neighbourhood of ulthar for in ulthar according to an ancient and significant law no man may kill a cat very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimneypots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough carter the cats being somewhat dispersed by the halfseen zoogs picked his way directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and old records were said to be and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stonewhich crowns ulthars highest hillhe sought out the patriarch atal who had been up the forbidden peak hathegkla in the stony desert and had come down again aliveatal seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple was fully three centuries old but still very keen of mind and memory from him carter learned many things about the gods but mainly that they are indeed only earths gods ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere they might atal said heed a mans prayer if in good humour but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste it was lucky that no man knew where kadath towers for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave atals companion barzai the wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of hathegkla with unknown kadath if ever found matters would be much worse for although earths gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal they are protected by the other gods from outside whom it is better not to discuss at least twice in the worlds history the other gods set their seal upon earths primal granite once in antediluvian times as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic manuscripts too ancient to be read and once on hathegkla when barzai the wise tried to see earths gods dancing by moonlight so atal said it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayerscarter though disappointed by atals discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven cryptical books of hsan did not wholly despair first he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods aid but atal could tell him nothing probably atal said the place belonged to his especial dreamworld and not to the general land of vision that many know and conceivably it might be on another planet in that case earths gods could not guide him if they would but this was not likely since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the great ones wished to hide from himthen carter did a wicked thing offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moonwine which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative robbed of his reserve poor atal babbled freely of forbidden things telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek on the isle of oriab in the southern sea and hinting that it may be a likeness which earths gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain and he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange so that one might easily recognise them and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the godsnow the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to carter it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones often espouse the daughters of men so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their blood this being so the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on ngranek and mark the features then having noted them with care to search for such features among living men where they are plainest and thickest there must the gods dwell nearest and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands kadathmuch of the great ones might be learnt in such regions and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker they might not know their parentage for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly a thing which carter realised even as he sought to scale kadath but they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in dreamland that common folk would call them fools and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret and more one might in certain cases seize some wellloved child of a god as hostage or even capture some young god himself disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his brideatal however did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges down to the southern sea where no burgess of ulthar has ever been but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and twowheeled carts there is a great city there dylathleen but in ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black threebanked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore the traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human or nearly so but the rowers are never beheld and it is not thought wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibitedby the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy and carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest as he turned to go he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priests conversation he recalled too the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked their chops and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no fartherit was sunset now so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town and as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond all mellow and magical in the slanted light he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one on toward unknown perils then twilight fell and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows and sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the skai with the night came song and carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tessellated courts of simple ulthar and there might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthars many cats but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moons dark side whither the cats leap from tall housetops but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in carters lap to purr and play and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant drowsy herbsin the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for dylathleen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthars busy farms and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the skai stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmens songs came from the placid river the country was very beautiful with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmillson the seventh day a blur of smoke arose on the horizon ahead and then the tall black towers of dylathleen which is built mostly of basalt dylathleen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the giants causeway and its streets are dark and uninviting there are many dismal seataverns near the myriad wharves and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab and found that they knew of it well ships came from baharna on that island one being due to return thither in only a month and ngranek is but two days zebraride from that port but few had seen the stone face of the god because it is on a very difficult side of ngranek which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava once the gods were angered with men on that side and spoke of the matter to the other godsit was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in dylathleens seataverns because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys one of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock the mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste and their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the six kingdoms but worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded yet to give no glimpse of its crew it was not fair to the tavernkeepers of dylathleen or to the grocers and butchers either for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard the merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from parg across the river that was all they ever took those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers never anything from the butchers and grocers but only gold and the fat black men of parg whom they bought by the pound and the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old seataverns bear them dylathleen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere but no mine in all earths dreamland was known to produce their likeof these things dylathleens cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna which might bear him to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren meanwhile he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset of these things however he learned nothing though he once thought that a certain old slanteyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of this man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar he was even rumoured to have dealt with that highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery that such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted but carter soon found that it was no use questioning himthen the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt mole and the tall lighthouse silent and alien and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront and after a while the dark widemouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped stealthily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers carter observed them closely and disliked them more the longer he looked at them then he saw them drive the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley and wondered in what landsor if in any lands at allthose fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serveand on the third evening of that galleys stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of carters quest he appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling and though the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked he bade him therefore be his own guest in locked chambers above and drew out the last of the zoogs moonwine to loosen his tongue the strange merchant drank heavily but smirked unchanged by the draught then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended he offered his wine to his host and though carter took only the least sip he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles all the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirthcarter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tentlike awning on the deck of a ship with the marvellous coasts of the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness he was not chained but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches he saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellowdreamer of eartha lighthousekeeper in ancient kingsporthad often discoursed in the old days and recognised the templed terraces of zar abode of forgotten dreams the spires of infamous thalarion that daemoncity of a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns the charnal gardens of xura land of pleasures unattained and the twin headlands of crystal meeting above in a resplendent arch which guard the harbour of sonanyl blessed land of fancypast all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below and before the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the basalt pillars of the west beyond which simple folk say splendid cathuria lies but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earths dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemonsultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods blind voiceless tenebrous and mindless with their soul and messenger nyarlathotepmeanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest it is understood in the land of dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men and all these agents whether wholly human or slightly less than human are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger the crawling chaos nyarlathotep so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their castle on kadath had decided to take him away and deliver him to nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside carter could not guess nor could he imagine at what hellish trystingplace they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward he knew however that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central voidat the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around but when they gave carter a portion he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derivedit was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars and the deck grew damp and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken and carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and cometlike into planetary space never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity these are the nameless larvae of the other gods and like them are blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and thirstsbut that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably the ship made for the edge and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from the earth and which no fully human person save perhaps the dreamer snirethko has ever beheld the close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no wholesome or suitable gods and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to lurk some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution and what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been carter steadily refused to conjecturewhen the ship rounded the edge and sailed over those lands unseen by man there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life and carter saw many low broad round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi he noticed that these cottages had no windows and thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea and knew that the voyage was once more to be by wateror at least through some liquid the galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to carter they now slid along at great speed once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and starstrown even though the sun shone scorchingly in itthere presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprouslooking coast and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city the way they leaned and bent the manner in which they were clustered and the fact that they had no windows at all was very disturbing to the prisoner and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban as the coast drew nearer and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger he saw upon the jagged hills many forests some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moontree in the enchanted wood of earth from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar winecarter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them for they were not men at all or even approximately men but great greyishwhite slippery things which could expand and contract at will and whose principal shapethough it often changedwas that of a sort of toad without any eyes but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt vague snout these objects were waddling busily about the wharves moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws and now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in dylathleen only these herds being without turbans or shoes or clothing did not seem so very human after all some of these slavesthe fatter ones whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentallywere unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vansonce a van was hitched up and driven off and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that carter gasped even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toadthings as officers navigators and rowers and carter saw that the almosthuman creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength such as steering and cooking fetching and carrying and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded these creatures must have been convenient on earth for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations but most of them unless lean and illfavoured were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated some very like these semihumans some not so similar and some not similar at all and he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drayswhen the galley landed at a greasylooking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toadthings wiggled out of the hatches and two of them seized carter and dragged him ashore the smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling and carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows at length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness it was apparently all one to the toadthings whether it were light or dark the odour of the place was intolerable and when carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions it was circular and about twenty feet acrossfrom then on time ceased to exist at intervals food was pushed in but carter would not touch it what his fate would be he did not know but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinitys other gods the crawling chaos nyarlathotep finally after an unguessed span of hours or days the great stone door swung wide again and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the redlitten streets of that fearsome city it was night on the moon and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torchesin a detestable square a sort of procession was formed ten of the toadthings and twentyfour almosthuman torchbearers eleven on either side and one each before and behind carter was placed in the middle of the line five toadthings ahead and five behind and one almosthuman torchbearer on each side of him certain of the toadthings produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited carter could not doubt and he wished that the suspense might soon be over the whining of those impious flutes was shocking and he would have given worlds for some even halfnormal sound but these toadthings had no voices and the slaves did not talkthen through that starspecked darkness there did come a normal sound it rolled from the higher hills and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus it was the midnight yell of the cat and carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally springing from high housetops verily it is to the moons dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows and here amidst that column of foetid things carter heard their homely friendly cry and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of homenow much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable but that he need not have done for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions the call of the clan had been given and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it the flutes stopped and there were shrieks in the night dying almosthumans screamed and cats spit and yowled and roared but the toadthings made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungiit was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted and carter had never before seen so many cats black grey and white yellow tiger and mixed common persian and manx thibetan angora and egyptian all were there in the fury of battle and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of bubastis they would leap seven strong at the throat of an almosthuman or the pink tentacled snout of a toadthing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battlefury carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the frayat last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene the great shining disc of the earth thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array circle on circle they reached and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly of the dead slaves and toadthings there were not many signs but carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the beginning of the solid circles of the warriorscarter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate he had not been unmarked in ulthar when he passed through and the sleek old cats had remembered how he petted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten and they recalled too how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left the grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognised the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dreama yowl now came from a farther peak and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation it was one of the armys outposts stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earths cats fear the very large and peculiar cats from saturn who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moons dark side they are leagued by treaty with the evil toadthings and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matterafter a brief consultation of generals the cats rose and assumed a closer formation crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland the old fieldmarshal advised carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed he also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired and carter decided on the city of dylathleen whence the black galley had set out for he wished to sail thence for oriab and the carven crest of ngranek and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off then upon a signal the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst while in a black cave on a far unhallowed summit of the moonmountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotepthe leap of the cats through space was very swift and being surrounded by his companions carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at dylathleen and the stealthy friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams the old leader from ulthar was the last to leave and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow when dawn came carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving there was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways most of the townsfolk believed him yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the widemouthed merchants if aught of evil ever befalls dylathleen through such traffick it will not be his faultin about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black mole and tall lighthouse and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriabs inner groves and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna and the strange little figures carved from ngraneks ancient lava for this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in parg carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days and during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lavagatherers and imagemakers in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it the captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face for the wrong side of ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the nightgaunts but the captain did not wish to say just what a nightgaunt might be like since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them then carter asked that captain about unknown kadath in the cold waste and the marvellous sunset city but of these the good man could truly tell nothingcarter sailed out of dylathleen one early morning when the tide turned and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town and for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimneypots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying but on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of the water was stronger and soon passed from sight of any land on the fifth day the sailors were nervous but the captain apologised for their fears saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it he admitted moreover that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea having been hailed when quite close to it but never seen againthat night the moon was very bright and one could see a great way down in the water there was so little wind that the ship could not move much and the ocean was very calm looking over the rail carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of a great temple and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea as the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the washeddown walls of myriad little housesthen the suburbs appeared and finally a great lone building on a hill of simpler architecture than the other structures and in much better repair it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square with a tower at each corner a paved court in the centre and small curious round windows all over it probably it was of basalt though weeds draped the greater part and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or monastery some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court and saw that something was tied to it and when after getting a telescope from the captains cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab head downward and without any eyes he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the seathe next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar in the land of forgotten dreams with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and snowcrowned in the distance oriab is a very great isle and its port of baharna a mighty city the wharves of baharna are of porphyry and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath on whose farther shore are the vast claybrick ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome and in all the million windows of baharnas terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbourthe captain after landing made carter a guest in his own small house on the shore of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the travellers delight and in the days after that carter asked for rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lavagatherers and imagemakers meet but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it and besides one could never depend on the certainty that nightgaunts are altogether fabulouswhen the captain sailed back to dylathleen carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yaths farther shore here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek and correlated all that he had learned from the lavagatherers about the roads thither the keeper of the tavern was a very old man and had heard so many legends that he was a great help he even took carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the olden days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit ngraneks higher slopes the old tavernkeepers greatgrandfather had heard from his greatgrandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and seen the carven face here drawing it for others to behold but carter had very great doubts since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste with horns and wings and claws and curling tailsat last having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of baharna carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by yaths shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony ngranek on his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the skai by evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on yaths farther shore and though old lavagatherers had warned him not to camp there at night he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher around him he wrapped another blanket for the nights are cold in oriab and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin grovesthe sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath and carter looked about for his tethered zebra great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat his pack had been disturbed and several shiny knickknacks taken away and all around on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account the legends and warnings of lavagatherers occurred to him and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward ngranek though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peerhis course now led uphill through wilder and partly wooded country and he saw only the huts of charcoalburners and the camps of those who gathered resin from the groves the whole air was fragrant with balsam and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun near sunset he came on a new camp of lavagatherers returning with laden sacks from ngraneks lower slopes and here he also camped listening to the songs and tales of the men and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost he had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him and at nightfall did not return to his fellows when they looked for him the next day they found only his turban nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen they did not search any more because the old men among them said it would be of no use no one ever found what the nightgaunts took though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous carter asked them if nightgaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry when he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more but went to sleep in his blanketthe next day he rose with the lavagatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he had bought of them their older men gave him blessings and warnings and told him he had better not climb too high on ngranek but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded for still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown kadath and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset by noon after a long uphill ride he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hillpeople who had once dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeepers grandfather but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked their homes had crept even up the mountains slope and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose at last they decided it would be better to leave altogether since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in baharna inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of imagemaking which to this day they carry on it was from these children of the exiled hillpeople that carter had heard the best tales about ngranek when searching through baharnas ancient tavernsall this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and higher as carter approached it there were sparse trees on the lower slope and feeble shrubs above them and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it in places there were solid streams of lava and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges ninety aeons ago before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders now it towered all silent and sinister bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told and there were caves in that mountain which might be empty and alone with elder darkness or mightif legend spoke trulyhold horrors of a form not to be surmisedthe ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees and strown with bits of rock lava and ancient cinder there were the charred embers of many camps where the lavagatherers were wont to stop and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in ngraneks high passes and labyrinthine caves at evening carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blanket before going to sleep and all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool but carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of ngranekin the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin road became too steep thereafter he scrambled up alone first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there he regretted coming clear of the trees since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying at length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked around the deserted huts of the imagemakers the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten he found it best not to look around and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling tothen the soil became meagre with great patches of bare rock cropping out and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock and had it not been very rough and weathered he could scarcely have ascended farther knobs ledges and pinnacles however helped greatly and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some lavagatherer scratched clumsily in the friable stone and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him after a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent once or twice carter dared to look around and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below all the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight with baharnas stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance and beyond that the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secretsthus far there had been much winding around the mountain so that the farther and carven side was still hidden carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no culdesac but that it led steeply on in an arc which would unless suddenly interrupted or deflected bring him after a few hours climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava as new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed the mountains side too was somewhat different being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left some of these were above him and some beneath him all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man the air was very cold now but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it only the increasing rarity bothered him and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of nightgaunts whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths he was not much impressed by travellers tales but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown kadathat last in the fearsome iciness of upper space he came round fully to the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked the olden wrath of the great ones there was unfolded too a vast expanse of country to the south but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys and seemed to have no ending no trace of the sea was visible on this side for oriab is a great island black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs but none of them was accessible to a climber there now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view and carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable poised in windy insecurity miles above earth with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun ngraneks hidden side he could not turn round yet the sun was already low if there were no way aloft the night would find him crouching there still and the dawn would not find him at allbut there was a way and he saw it in due season only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds yet to carter they were sufficient surmounting now the outwardhanging rock he found the slope above much easier than that below since a great glaciers melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges to the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths with a caves dark mouth just out of reach above him elsewhere however the mountain slanted back strongly and even gave him space to lean and resthe felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight surely enough there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed hanging there forever in bold outline black against the white of the frozen peak and when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud and clutched at the jagged rock in awe for the titan bulge had not stayed as earths dawn had shaped it but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a godstern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire how vast it was no mind can ever measure but carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it it was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken and carter saw that it was indeed so for those long narrow eyes and longlobed ears and that thin nose and pointed chin all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods he clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie even though it was this which he had expected and come to find for there is in a gods face more of marvel than prediction can tell and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking down at sunset in the cryptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old the marvel is so strong that none may escape ithere too was the added marvel of recognition for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the gods children he now knew that he need not do so certainly the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport celephas which lies in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in waking life every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephas and it was clear that these could be no others than the halfgods he sought where they dwelt there must the cold waste lie close and within it unknown kadath and its onyx castle for the great ones so to celephas he must go far distant from the isle of oriab and in such parts as would take him back to dylathleen and up the skai to the bridge by nir and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of thran where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenerian seabut dusk was now thick and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow perched on that ledge night found the seeker and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley the stars came out but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes nothingness leagued with death against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reachsuddenly without a warning sound in the dark carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below and between him and the milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and batwinged other things too had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space another minute and the stars were gone and carter knew that the nightgaunts had got himthey bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond when he struggled as at first he did by instinct they tickled him with deliberation they made no sound at all themselves and even their membraneous wings were silent they were frightfully cold and damp and slippery and their paws kneaded one detestably soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling giddying sickening rush of dank tomblike air and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness he screamed again and again but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell and which is litten only by the pale deathfire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earths coreat last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled peaks of thok awful and sinister they stand in the haunted dusk of sunless and eternal depths higher than man may reckon and guarding terrible valleys where the bholes crawl and burrow nastily but carter preferred to look at them than at his captors which were indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth oily whalelike surfaces unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other batwings whose beating made no sound ugly prehensile paws and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly and worst of all they never spoke or laughed and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be all they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle that was the way of nightgauntsas the band flew lower the peaks of thok rose grey and towering on all sides and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impassive granite of the endless twilight at still lower levels the deathfires in the air gave out and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblinlike soon the peaks were very far away and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them then in the end the nightgaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones and left carter all alone in that black valley to bring him thither was the duty of the nightgaunts that guard ngranek and this done they flapped away silently when carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not since even the peaks of thok had faded out of sight there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bonesnow carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnath where crawl and burrow the enormous bholes but he did not know what to expect because no one has ever seen a bhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like bholes are known only by dim rumour from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one they cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark carter did not wish to meet a bhole so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective for whispers of pnath and its approaches were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days in brief it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than thoks peaks which marks the edge of their domain showers of bones would tell him where to look and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder for strange to say he had a very singular link with these terrible creaturesa man he had known in bostona painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyardhad actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering this man had vanished at last and carter was not sure but that he might find him now and use for the first time in dreamland that faraway english of his dim waking life in any case he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of pnath and it would be better to meet a ghoul which one can see than a bhole which one cannot seeso carter walked in the dark and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot once he bumped into a stony slope and knew it must be the base of one of thoks peaks then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls he was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below but realised that the inner world has strange laws as he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoulsound travels slowly so that it was some time before he heard an answering glibber but it came at last and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered the wait for this was very tense since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting indeed it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off as this thoughtfully approached he became more and more uncomfortable for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come finally the tension grew almost unbearable and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound it was the ladder and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands but the other sound did not cease and followed him even as he climbed he had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below at a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling and thereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed bhole whose form no man might seefor hours he climbed with aching arms and blistered hands seeing again the grey deathfire and thoks uncomfortable pinnacles at last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls whose vertical side he could not glimpse and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of notre dame this almost made him lose his hold through faintness but a moment later he was himself again for his vanished friend richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiouslyhe was now on a dimlitten plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows the ghouls were in general respectful even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world a greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickmans present habitation so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould they emerged on a dim plain strown with singular relics of earthold gravestones broken urns and grotesque fragments of monumentsand carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumberthere on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the granary burying ground in boston sat the ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman it was naked and rubbery and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure but it still remembered a little english and was able to converse with carter in grunts and monosyllables helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills it seemed rather doubtful for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland leaving that to the webfooted wamps that are spawned in dead cities and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood including the terrible kingdom of the gugsthe gugs hairy and gigantic once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos nyarlathotep until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earths gods and they were banished to caverns below only a great trapdoor of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earthghouls with the enchanted wood and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse that a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable for mortal dreamers were their former food and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts those repulsive beings which die in the light and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroosso the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss at sarkomand that deserted city in the valley below leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diorite lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood this however did not suit the seeker for he knew nothing of the way from leng to oothnargai and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream it were disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in celephas and who being the sons of gods must point the way to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwellafter much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs kingdom there was one chance that carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors and reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it which has the stairs leading up to that stone trapdoor in the enchanted wood pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see feasting therehe also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself shaving the beard he had allowed to grow for ghouls have none wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface and loping in the usual slumping way with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb they would reach the city of the gugswhich is coterminous with the whole kingdomthrough the proper burrows emerging in a cemetery not far from the staircontaining tower of koth they must beware however of a large cave near the cemetery for this is the mouth of the vaults of zin and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs for they cannot discriminate they are very primitive and eat one another the gugs have a sentry at a narrow place in the vaults of zin but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts though ghasts cannot live in real light they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hoursso at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of col nehemiah derby obiit 1719 from the charter street burying ground in salem when they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs on the right of the hole out of which they wriggled and seen through aisles of monoliths was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth this was the great city of the gugs whose doorways are thirty feet high ghouls come here often for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of pnathstraight ahead and just outside the cemetery rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness and truly that warning was soon well justified for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs resting had been rightly timed there glowed in the gloom of that great caverns mouth first one pair of yellowishred eyes and then another implying that the gugs were one sentry less and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight and carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose a forehead and other important particularspresently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow and a ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of battlescars was a bad sign it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all but merely slipped past him as he slept so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim it was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts and yet horrible as they were they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddennessit was a paw fully two feet and a half across and equipped with formidable talons after it came another paw and after that a great blackfurred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms then two pink eyes shone and the head of the awakened gug sentry large as a barrel wobbled into view the eyes jutted two inches from each side shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head opening vertically instead of horizontallybut before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet the vindictive ghasts were upon him carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression the battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug nipping and tearing with their muzzles and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves all the time they coughed excitedly screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern as it was the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuancethen the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace but even so the journey was no brief one for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale at last however they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in basrelief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning this was the central tower with the sign of koth and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted woodthere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps which were fashioned for gugs and were therefore nearly a yard high of their number carter could form no just estimate for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him all through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the great ones curse there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top so sharp are the ears of gugs that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants accustomed from their ghasthunts in the vaults of zin to seeing without light to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those cyclopean steps it was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs there was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs if the gugs slept long and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and illdisposed things in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gugthen after aeons of climbing there came a cough from the darkness above and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn it was clear that a ghast or perhaps even more had strayed into that tower before the coming of carter and his guides and it was equally clear that this peril was very close after a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight ghouls can see in the dark so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been alone in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast and the slabbearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow presently two yellowishred eyes flashed into view and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering as it hopped down to the step just above the ghouls they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap there seemed to be only this one animal and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again as before they were obliged to aid him and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghasts uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blacknessat last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt and feeling above him carter realised that the great stone trapdoor was reached at last to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop and permit carter to escape through the crack they themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs since their elusiveness was great and they did not know the way overland to spectral sarkomand with its lionguarded gate to the abyssmighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them and carter helped push with as much strength as he had they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles after a few moments a crack of light appeared and carter to whom that task had been entrusted slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture there now ensued a mighty heaving but progress was very slow and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal opensuddenly their desperation was magnified a thousandfold by a sound on the steps below them it was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghasts hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels but of all the possible causes of that bodys dislodgment and rolling none was in the least reassuring therefore knowing the ways of gugs the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst carter turned the slab and left a generous opening they now helped carter through letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside another second and they were through themselves knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trapdoor while a panting became audible beneath because of the great ones curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal so with a deep relief and sense of repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls restweird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago it was verily a haven and a delight after the gulfs he had now left behind there was no living denizen about for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course to return through the tower they no longer dared and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests nasht and kamanthah in the cavern of flame so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its gate of the abyss though of how to get there they knew nothing carter recalled that it lies in the valley below leng and recalled likewise that he had seen in dylathleen a sinister slanteyed old merchant reputed to trade on leng therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out dylathleen crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the river to its mouth this they at once resolved to do and lost no time in loping off since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was pickman but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left for a ghoul is a ghoul and at best an unpleasant companion for man after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carriedit was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day wherefore carter set out upon the wellknown route toward celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills and as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an ash tree on ngranek in faraway oriab so many aeons ago and wondered if any lavagatherer had fed and released it and he wondered too if he would ever return to baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by yaths shore and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamlandbut presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree he had avoided the great circle of stones since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern for a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs it all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions the matter had long rankled and now or within at least a month the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise this was the plan of the zoogs and carter saw that he must foil it before leaving on his mighty questvery quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields and a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small black grey tiger white yellow and mixed and it echoed through nir and beyond the skai even into ulthar and ulthars numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march it was fortunate that the moon was not up so that all the cats were on earth swiftly and silently leaping they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood carter was there to greet them and the sight of shapely wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss he was glad to see his venerable friend and onetime rescuer at the head of ulthars detachment a collar of rank around his sleek neck and whiskers bristling at a martial angle better still as a sublieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that longvanished morning in ulthar he was a strapping and promising cat now and purred as he shook hands with his friend his grandfather said he was doing very well in the army and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaigncarter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe and was rewarded by deepthroated purrs of gratitude from all sides consulting with the generals he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilisation of their army of invasion thereupon without a moments loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs they saw that they were beaten in advance and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present selfpreservationhalf the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the centre leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood terms were discussed at length carter acting as interpreter and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large annual tribute of grouse quail and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of their forest twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the temple of the cats at ulthar and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs these matters disposed of the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glancethe old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise this offer he welcomed with gratitude not only for the safety it afforded but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment relaxed after the successful performance of its duty randolph carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in the cold waste but did not know where it was as for the marvellous sunset city he had not even heard of that but would gladly relay to carter anything he might later learnhe gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in celephas whither he was bound that old cat already slightly known to carter was a dignified maltese and would prove highly influential in any transaction it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell the young sublieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army so carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willowfringed river and the cats went back into the woodwell did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the cerenerian sea and blithely did he follow the singing river oukranos that marked his course the sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle a blessed haze lies upon all this region wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold and a little more of the summers humming music of birds and bees so that men walk through it as through a faery place and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward rememberby noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to the rivers edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of ilekvad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukranos who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks all of jasper is that temple and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts its seven pinnacled towers and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests none but the king of ilekvad may say for only he has entered the temple or seen the priests now in the drowsiness of day that carven and delicate fane was silent and carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under an enchanted sunall that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukranos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side whose trees came down clear to the waters edge in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink but now he could not glimpse any once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird which it lured to the water by shewing its tempting scales in the sun and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon ittoward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows for they are more ancient than memory yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets the clustered towers within all white beneath their golden spires are loftier still so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky sometimes shining clear sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours and where thrans gates open on the river are great wharves of marble with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places landward beyond the walls lies the farm country where small white cottages dream between little hills and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardensdown through this verdant land carter walked at evening and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of thran and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate and was stopped by a redrobed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thrans steep mysterious streets and linger in bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold then into that incredible city he walked through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers lights shone through grated and balconied windows and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled carter knew his way and edged down through darker streets to the river where at an old seatavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams there he bought his passage to celephas on a great green galleon and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten godsin the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephas and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the cerenerian sea began for many leagues the banks were much as they were above thran with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right and a drowsy village on the shore with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun mindful of his search carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of celephas asking the names and ways of the strange men with long narrow eyes longlobed ears thin noses and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephas of these men the sailors knew not much save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about themtheir land very far away was called inganok and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land and said to be close to unpleasant leng although high impassable mountains towered on the side where leng was thought to lie so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon certainly men reached leng from very different oceans of other boundaries of inganok those sailors had no notion nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath save from vague unplaced report and of the marvellous sunset city which carter sought they knew nothing at all so the traveller asked no more of far things but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on ngraneklate in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of kled here carter wished he might disembark for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory lone and unbroken where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed for it is written that there may one day be need of them again and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due but the ship swept on and dusk hushed the hum of the day and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been and all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit themin the morning the river had broadened out greatly and carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea here the walls are of rugged granite and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland so that the city is not sought except for barter but is prized for the solid work of its artisans the wharves of hlanith are of oak and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns carter also went ashore and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden oxcarts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars the seataverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low blackbeamed ceilings and casements of greenish bullseye panes ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports and told many stories of the curious men from twilight inganok but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told then at last after much unloading and loading the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given themtwo nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its gingkotrees swaying on the lower slopes and carter knew that they were come to the land of oothnargai and the marvellous city of celephas swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues and the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea then rose the green gentle hills behind the town with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them and far in the background the purple ridge of the tanarians potent and mystical behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dreamthe harbour was full of painted galleys some of which were from the marble cloudcity of serannian that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spicefragrant wharves where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the citys million lights began to twinkle out over the water ever new seemed this deathless city of vision for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy as it has always been is still the turquoise temple of nathhorthath and the eighty orchidwreathed priests are the same who builded it ten thousand years ago shining still is the bronze of the great gates nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable yet without one grey hair in their forked beardscarter did not at once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors and when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he sought the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of inganok but was told that none were now in port their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks he found however one thorabonian sailor who had been to inganok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place and this sailor said there was certainly a desert to the north of the peopled region which everybody seemed to fear and shun the thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into lengs horrible plateau and that this was why men feared it though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown kadath stands he did not know but it seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels if indeed they truly existed were stationed for naughton the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the highpriest though nathhorthath is chiefly worshipped in celephas all the great ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods like atal in distant ulthar he strongly advised against any attempt to see them declaring that they are testy and capricious and subject to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish carter to reach it and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them no man had ever found kadath in the past and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuringhaving thanked the orchidcrowned highpriest carter left the temple and sought the bazaar of the sheepbutchers where the old chief of celephas cats dwelt sleek and contented that grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement and extended a languid paw as his caller approached but when carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of oothnargai best of all he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of celephas about the men of inganok on whose dark ships no cat will goit seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them though that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships the reason for this is that inganok holds shadows which no cat can endure so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical leng or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north none may say but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like and to which they are more sensitive than men therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of inganokthe old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king kuranes who in carters latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rosecrystal palace of the seventy delights at celephas and in the turreted cloudcastle of skyfloating serannian it seems that he could no more find content in those places but had formed a mighty longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood where in little dreaming villages englands old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys he could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the seacliffs to the foot of the tanarian hills there he dwelt in a grey gothic manorhouse of stone looking on the sea and tried to think it was ancient trevor towers where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light and on the coast nearby he had built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways settling therein such people as had the most english faces and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose tower he could see from his window placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon and with a moss somewhat like old englands moss for though kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream with all imagined pomps and marvels splendours and beauties ecstacies and delights novelties and excitements at his command he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet england that ancient beloved england which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a partso when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu he did not seek the terraced palace of rosecrystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the seacliffs and in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and anointed lackey of the palace but a small stubbly old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall and carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to englands trees and climbed the terraces among gardens set out as in queen annes time at the door flanked by stone cats in the old way he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery and was presently taken to the library where kuranes lord of oothnargai and the sky around serannian sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawnparty at the vicars with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patiencekuranes clad in a dressinggown of the sort favoured by london tailors in his youth rose eagerly to meet his guest for the sight of an anglosaxon from the waking world was very dear to him even if it was a saxon from boston massachusetts instead of from cornwall and for long they talked of old times having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places kuranes indeed had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyageat length carter brought up the subject of his quest and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others kuranes did not know where kadath was or the marvellous sunset city but he did know that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out and that the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of space especially in that region where form does not exist and coloured gases study the innermost secrets the violet gas sngac had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemonsultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark altogether it was not well to meddle with the elder ones and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city it were better not to seek that citykuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it he himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely celephas and the land of oothnargai and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains conventions and stupidities but now that he was come into that city and that land and was the king thereof he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories he was a king in oothnargai but found no meaning therein and drooped always for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth all his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over the downs and all the thousand minarets of celephas for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home so he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite the content he sought and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and halfremembered dream for he had visited carter often in the old waking days and knew well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birthat the last he was very certain the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes the glow of beacon hill at evening the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and witchhaunted arkham and the blessed miles of meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure these things he told randolph carter but still the seeker held to his purpose and in the end they parted each with his own conviction and carter went back through the bronze gate into celephas and down the street of the pillars to the old seawall where he talked more with the mariners of far parts and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inganok whose strangefaced sailors and onyxtraders had in them the blood of the great onesone starlight evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the longedfor ship put in and strangefaced sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the seawall it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features on ngranek but carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land they talked little with the other folk in those ancient seataverns but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland and so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melodyfor a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of celephas and before they sailed carter had taken passage on their dark ship telling them that he was an old onyxminer and wishful to work in their quarries that ship was very lovely and cunningly wrought being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted and as carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunriseblazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless celephas sink into the distance and the snowy peak of mount aran grow smaller and smaller by noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea with one painted galley afar off bound for that cloudhung realm of serannian where the sea meets the skyand night came with gorgeous stars and the dark ship steered for charles wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea carter went to sleep at midnight and rose in the glow of a young morning marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont and all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land of their exquisite onyx city and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which leng was said to be they told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of inganok and how they thought the hidden nearness of leng was to blame for it only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk there was something disquieting about that desert and it was thought expedient not to admit its existenceon later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was going to work there were many of them for all the city of inganok was builded of onyx whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in rinar ogrothan and celephas and at home with the merchants of thraa ilarnek and kadatheron for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports and far to the north almost in that cold desert whose existence the men of inganok did not care to admit there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld who had mined those incredible blocks and whither they had been transported no man might say but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling so it was left all alone in the twilight with only the raven and the rumoured shantakbird to brood on its immensities when carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought for he knew from old tales that the great ones castle atop unknown kadath is of onyxeach day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker and in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night on the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar the first land glimpsed since arans snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship carter asked the captain the name of that rock but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night and when after dark a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place the traveller was glad that no stop had been made and that the rock had no name the seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot and carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hourstwo mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs and some knelt down on the deck to pray so that carter knew they were come to the land of inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that lands name toward noon a dark coastline appeared and before three oclock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays all of delicate black with scrolls flutings and arabesques of inlaid gold tall and manywindowed were the houses and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination the walls were low and pierced by frequent gates each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant ngranek on a hill in the centre rose a sixteenangled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome this the seamen said was the temple of the elder ones and was ruled by an old highpriest sad with inner secretsat intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns viols and chanting voices and from a row of tripods on a gallery round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts as the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest and carter saw the slaves sailors and merchants on the docks the sailors and merchants were of the strangefaced race of the gods but the slaves were squat slanteyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from valleys beyond leng the wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar ogrothan and celephasit was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city the streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow the houses near the water were lower than the rest and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each the captain of the ship took carter to an old seatavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city and lead him to the taverns of the onyxminers by the northern wall and evening fell and little bronze lamps were lighted and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places but when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away for there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of inganok and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly closefar in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not like for it was unmistakably that of the old slanteyed merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of dylathleen who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar and even to have dealt with that highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and kadath and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inganok so close to the wonders of the north was not a reassuring thing he slipped wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined bearing the colossal and richflavoured eggs of the rumoured shantakbird to trade for the dexterous jade goblets that merchants brought from ilarnekon the following morning the shipcaptain led carter through the onyx streets of inganok dark under their twilight sky the inlaid doors and figured housefronts carven balconies and crystalpaned oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars colonnades and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous some of the vistas down long and unbending streets or through side alleys and over bulbous domes spires and arabesqued roofs were weird and beautiful beyond words and nothing was more splendid than the massive height of the great central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides its flattened dome and its lofty pinnacled belfry overtopping all else and majestic whatever its foreground and always to the east far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous leng was said to liethe captain took carter to the mighty temple which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheels hub the seven arched gates of that garden each having over it a carven face like those on the citys gates are always open and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods and there are fountains pools and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony all of onyx and having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean when the deep clang from the temples belfry shivers over the garden and the city and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates there issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in black bearing at arms length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises and all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file legs thrown far forward without bending the knees down the walks that lead to the seven lodges wherein they disappear and do not appear again it is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple and that the long files of priests return through them nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told but only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human priestscarter did not enter the temple because none but the veiled king is permitted to do that but before he left the garden the hour of the bell came and he heard the shivering clang deafeningly above him and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of bowlbearing priests in their singular way giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give when the last of them had vanished he left that garden noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed even the shipcaptain did not like that spot and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled kings palace rises manydomed and marvellousthe ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow all but that broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yakdrawn chariots carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance always ahead loomed those titan walls mighty buttresses and clustered and bulbous domes for which the veiled kings palace is famous and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarchs pleasure there carter paused in faintness at so much of beauty for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks the gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices the brazen urns and tripods with cunning basreliefs the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble the basaltbottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality and halffabulous even in the land of dream there it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right and ever the small birds and the fountains sang while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden no other human presence was there and carter was glad it was so then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps for the palace itself no visitor may enter and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantakbirds and to send out queer dreams to the curiousafter that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town near the gate of the caravans where are the taverns of the yakmerchants and the onyxminers and there in a lowceiled inn of quarrymen they said farewell for business called the captain whilst carter was eager to talk with miners about the north there were many men in that inn and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them saying that he was an old miner of onyx and anxious to know somewhat of inganoks quarries but all that he learnt was not much more than he knew before for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits they had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is said to lie and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks and they whispered also that the rumoured shantakbirds are no wholesome things it being indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one for that fabled father of shantaks in the kings dome is fed in the darkthe next day saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of inganok carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddlebags for a journey beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions once finding a host so austere and reticent and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves or upon one with full ninetenths of their blood dwelling amongst men and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded himthat night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygathtree to which he tied his yak and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage at about ten oclock he reached the smalldomed village of urg where traders rest and miners tell their tales and paused in its taverns till noon it is here that the great caravan road turns west toward selarn but carter kept on north by the quarry road all the afternoon he followed that rising road which was somewhat narrower than the great highway and which now led through a region with more rocks than tilled fields and by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizeable black cliffs so that he knew he was close to the mining country all the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right and the farther he went the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering onyxcarts along the wayon the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground he observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at this northerly point and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them and on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels before evening he had passed eleven quarries the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders with no vegetation at all but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right the third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west and they sang many songs and told many tales shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the great ones they asked him whither he went and cautioned him not to go too far to the north but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors in the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than mens hands had wrenched prodigious blocks but he did not like it when turning back to wave a last farewell he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant dylathleenafter two more quarries the inhabited part of inganok seemed to end and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yakpath among forbidding black cliffs always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time once in a while a raven would croak far overhead and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured shantakbird but in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak become more and more reluctant to advance and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the routethe path now contracted between sable and glistening walls and began to display an even greater steepness than before it was a bad footing and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strown thickly about in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course to reach this crest however was no easy task for the way had grown nearly perpendicular and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones eventually carter dismounted and led his dubious yak pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled and keeping his own footing as best he might then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond and gasped at what he sawthe path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down with the same lines of high natural walls as before but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space vast acres in extent where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giants quarry far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge and deep down within earths bowels its lower delvings yawned it was no quarry of man and the concave sides were scarred with great squares yards wide which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels high over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarryall at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom but carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed soon the lefthand cliffs resumed their course making the way once more a narrow lane and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flightonce he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast and doubled his speed from this encouragement he was covering miles and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north the gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the righthand crags and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark and limitless plain and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears plainer than before but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak these beats were ruthless and purposeful and they were behind himcarters pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable his yak must have heard or felt it first and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost he could not see the hoofprints of his yak but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings that he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its placethen dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing he had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains but now he saw it was something more the phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly and even silhouetted parts of it as low vapours glowed behind how distant it was he could not tell but it must have been very far it was thousands of feet high stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills but now those hills were hills no more for some hand greater than mans had touched them silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever all in a great half circle they squatted those doglike mountains carven into monstrous watching statues and their right hands were raised in menace against mankindit was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy laps great forms whose motions were no delusion winged and whirring those forms grew larger each moment and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end they were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horses carter knew that they must be the shantakbirds of ill rumour and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert and as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him where indeed was trotting the squat slanteyed trader of evil legend grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pitstrapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles randolph carter did not lose consciousness lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him while the slanteyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive then the man motioned carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks helping him up as his judgment struggled with his loathing it was hard work ascending for the shantakbird has scales instead of feathers and those scales are very slippery once he was seated the slanteyed man hopped up behind him leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossithere now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which leng was said to lie far above the clouds they flew till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of inganok have never seen and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on ngranek but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horseheaded shantak appeared oddly fearful of them hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rearthe shantak now flew lower revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light and there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inganoks people are right in their geographick rumours for travellers have heard such sounds before and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit that haunted place of evil and mystery which is lengaround the feeble fires dark forms were dancing and carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be for no healthy folk have ever been to leng and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold so that carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau as the shantak flew lower the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures beforethey leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns of other clothing they had none but most of them were quite furry behind they had dwarfish tails and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths then he knew what they were and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all for the cryptic folk of leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at dylathleen those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moonthings they were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long ago and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moonbut the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow day came and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence at times the slanteyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass all this while the land was getting higher and finally they came to a windswept tableland which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world there all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building around which a circle of crude monoliths stood in all this arrangement there was nothing human and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotepthe loathsome bird now settled to the ground and the slanteyed man hopped down and helped his captive alight of the purpose of his seizure carter now felt very sure for clearly the slanteyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx castle it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the moonthings in dylathleen and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried leng and the cold waste north of inganok must be close to the other gods and there the passes to kadath are well guardedthe slanteyed man was small but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed so carter followed where he led and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery there were no lights inside but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid basreliefs and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors on the walls of the corridors were painted frightful scenes older than history and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth after countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still for the cold and dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp and shuddered at the tale they toldthrough those archaic frescoes lengs annals stalked and the horned hooved and widemouthed almosthumans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities there were scenes of old wars wherein lengs almosthumans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon and of the submission of lengs people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them those slippery greyishwhite blasphemies they worshipped as gods nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys the monstrous moonbeasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea and carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to inganok that grey accursed rock which inganoks seamen shun and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the nightand in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almosthumans proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves and wondrous with high fanes and carven places great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinxcrowned gates to a vast central plaza and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase again and again were those huge winged lions shewn their mighty flanks of diorite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night and as carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were and what city it was that the almosthumans had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys there could be no mistake for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied sarkomand whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyssother views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inganok and the monstrous shantakbirds that build nests on the ledges half way up and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them carter had seen those caves when he passed over them and had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens and those batwings curving horns barbed tails prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him he had met those silent flitting and clutching creatures before those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones fear and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord for they were the dreaded nightgaunts who never laugh or smile because they have no faces and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the vale of pnath and the passes to the outer worldthe slanteyed merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking basreliefs and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring there was no light in this vast and evilsmelling crypt and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little at the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face to this being the slanteyed man made certain signs with his hands and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silkcovered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask this colloquy went on for some time and to carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place it made him think of a frightful redlitten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it of that and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond before the rescuing rush of earths friendly cats he knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the highpriest not to be described of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities but he feared to think just what that abhorred highpriest might bethen the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyishwhite paws and carter knew what the noisome highpriest was and in that hideous second stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold tableland outside and that even on that tableland the noxious shantak still waited yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling silkrobed monstrositythe slanteyed man had set his curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altarstones by the pit and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the highpriest with his hands carter hitherto wholly passive now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark in almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridorsafter a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in true they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good but he wished none the less he had made the attempt those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside in time he became quite sure he was not followed and slackened his pace somewhat but scarce had he breathed in halfrelief when a new peril beset him his lamp was waning and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidancewhen the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark and prayed to the great ones for such help as they might afford at times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist the farther he went the damper it seemed to be and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least he believed though that his general course was down and the vaultlike smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in lengs unwholesome tableland but there was not any warning of the thing which came at last only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breathtaking chaos one moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been wellnigh verticalof the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy then he realised he was still with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him all around were crumbling walls and broken columns and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come ahead stretched double rows of pillars and the fragments and pedestals of pillars that spoke of a broad and bygone street and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things huge winged lions of diorite they were with blackness and shadow between them full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads and snarled derisive on the ruins around them and carter knew right well what they must be for legend tells of only one such twain they were the changeless guardians of the great abyss and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomandcarters first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around he wished no follower from lengs hateful monastery for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers of how to get from sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls since he knew they were no better informed than he the three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach sarkomand in their journey back but had planned to ask old traders in dylathleen he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed over lengs plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided for the highpriests emissaries must be many while at the journeys end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with if he could get a boat he might sail back to inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from sarkomands basalt quays but to find a boat in this aeondeserted city was no probable thing and it did not appear likely that he could ever make onesuch were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind all this while there had stretched before him the great corpselike width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinxcrowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city the glow rose and fell fitfully flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher and when he crept closer down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor and carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moonthen just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear and crept forward again instead of retreating once in crossing an open street he wriggled wormlike on his stomach and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole greenlitten scene of action there around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi there squatted a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their almosthuman slaves some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames and at intervals applying their whitehot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that the bluntsnouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native deepsthe number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess but fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in dylathleen concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the highpriest not to be described for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls black kingdom clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley it occurred to him that the portal like other gates to the abyss might be guarded by flocks of nightgaunts but he did not fear these faceless creatures now he had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls and the ghoul which was pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understoodso carter began another silent crawl through the ruins edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions it was ticklish work but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunted trees and briers that had grown up therein the gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard ten feet apart crouched the mockingfaced beasts of diorite brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled into fearsome basreliefs betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx midway in this space a black well opened and carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmareterrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs so worn and narrow were the steps and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian nightgaunts would suddenly pounce upon him if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage all about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind in time he became very numb and somnolent moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will nor did he realise any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind he was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery nightgaunts had performed their dutyawaked to the fact that he was in the cold damp clutch of the faceless flutterers carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight mindless though nightgaunts are said to be the effect was instantaneous for all tickling stopped at once and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position thus encouraged carter ventured some explanations telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moonbeasts and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them the nightgaunts though inarticulate seemed to understand what was said and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place and as carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery doglike tenants the nightgaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomercarter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared and made significant signs to the nightgaunts causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of nightgaunts on the plain till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled nightgaunts in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist richard pickman of boston and to him carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred the erstwhile pickman surprised to greet his ancient friend again seemed very much impressed and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throngfinally after scanning the ranks with care the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and nightgaunts a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended fore legs awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one as each ghoul reached the pair of nightgaunts to which he was assigned he was taken up and borne away into the blackness till at last the whole throng had vanished save for carter pickman and the other chiefs and a few pairs of nightgaunts pickman explained that nightgaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls and that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp slippery paws another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness endlessly up up up to the gate of the winged lions and the spectral ruins of primal sarkomandwhen after a great interval carter saw again the sickly light of sarkomands nocturnal sky it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and nightgaunts day he felt sure must be almost due but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless nightgaunts ahead the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame carter was now beside pickman in the front rank of ghouls and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts were totally unprepared the three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order the almosthuman slaves were asleep even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctorythe final swoop of the nightgaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almosthuman slaves being seized by a group of nightgaunts before a sound was made the moonbeasts of course were voiceless and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic nightgaunts clutched them but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons when a moonbeast writhed too violently a nightgaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles carter expected to see much slaughter but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans they glibbered certain simple orders to the nightgaunts which held the captives trusting the rest to instinct and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the great abyss to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes gugs ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moonbeasts and boarded the evilsmelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat surely enough the capture had been thorough for not a sign of further life could the victors detect carter anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland urged them not to sink the anchored galley and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio on the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations some of which carter cast at once into the seaghouls and nightgaunts now formed themselves in separate groups the former questioning their rescued fellows anent past happenings it appeared that the three had followed carters directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to dylathleen by way of nir and the skai stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a mans walk in dylathleens taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment but they had persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them then they knew that only a ship for lelagleng would serve their purpose and prepared to wait patiently for such a vesselbut evil spies had doubtless reported much for shortly a black galley put into port and the widemouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had once found himself this time however the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique sarkomand bent evidently on taking their captives before the highpriest not to be described they had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inganoks mariners shun and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the real masters of the ship being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour there too were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrisonsuch pastimes as give rise to the nighthowlings which men fear after that had come the landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures whose continuance the present rescue had preventedfuture plans were next discussed the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there to this however the nightgaunts objected since the prospect of flying over water did not please them most of the ghouls favoured the design but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged nightgaunts thereupon carter seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars to which proposal they eagerly assented grey day had now come and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers benches carter found them fairly apt at learning and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour not till three days later however did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest then the rowers trained and the nightgaunts safely stowed in the forecastle the party set sail at last pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing modes of approach and procedureon the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard such was their timbre that all the galleys crew shook visibly but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky the sides of the rock were very steep but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings and the low railings guarding travelled high roads no ship of men had ever come so near the place or at least had never come so near and departed again but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlandsthe headlands were prolongations of the island proper and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them there seemed to be no watchers on the outside so the galley was steered boldly through the flumelike strait and into the stagnant foetid harbour beyond here however all was bustle and activity with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay and scores of almosthuman slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouragingat sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness those with eyes staring intently and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly they did not of course realise that the black ship had changed hands for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almosthumans and the nightgaunts were all out of sight below by this time the leaders had fully formed a plan which was to loose the nightgaunts as soon as the wharf was touched and then to sail directly away leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures marooned on the rock the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there and afterward quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark from which not much would emerge alivethe ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the nightgaunts their simple instructions while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almosthuman slaves whose places they were taking some silent alarm must have been given for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring nightgaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean batsthe jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship but when the nightgaunts struck them they thought of such things no more it was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell when the last of the nightgaunts had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquestthe pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the nightgaunts to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men night fell and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the nightgaunts flight toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the topmost pinnacle and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast once or twice something seemed to fall from the thinning swarm into the sea but carter did not worry since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts cannot swim at length when the ghouls were satisfied that all the nightgaunts had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their doomed burdens the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stonefrightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many and in various stages of departure from their primal state carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive the stenchfilled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moontrees and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs countless weapons implements and ornaments lay about including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth these latter did not despite their material invite either appropriation or long inspection and carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces the scattered spears and javelins he collected and with pickmans approval distributed among the ghouls such devices were new to the doglike lopers but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hintsthe upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the mild gods atop kadath from the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions whose vaultings were covered with daemoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of leng where broods alone the highpriest not to be described on the distant shadowy side beyond the noisome well he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts and had profited in their fashion they had also found a hogshead of potent moonwine and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings though the rescued trio remembering its effect on them in dylathleen had warned their company to taste none of it of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store both rough and polished in one of the vaults near the water but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them carter did not try to carry any away since he knew too much about those which had mined themsuddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing and it could be but a moment before the almosthumans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter had distributed amongst them and at his command sustained by the being that was pickman they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crews discovery of the changed state of things and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account after a moment of hesitation the newcomers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemys course would bein a very few minutes a ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts and almosthumans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flumelike strait but only for a second then a few moments later a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for the ship itself moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible useby this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party the sea party commanded by carter boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea carter did not at once pursue it for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the townmeanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almosthumans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky the thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine and the general effect of those hybrid halfamorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama javelins began to fly from both sides and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almosthumans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubblesfor half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated on the east cliff however where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present the ghouls had not fared so well and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat then when the western battle was over the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hardpressed fellows turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland the almosthumans were by this time all slain but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws the time for javelins was now nearly past and the fight became a handtohand contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridgeas fury and recklessness increased the number falling into the sea became very great those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts the cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battleline some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above but a few survived to be rescued when the security of the land parties seemed assured carters galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the wayfinally the moonbeasts galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemys rear after which the fight was shortlived indeed attacked from both sides the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them the hostile galley meanwhile had disappeared and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victorsso by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care finding that over a fourth had been lost in the days battles the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley for pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating ones own wounded and the ablebodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed and carter was not sorry to be departing from that island of unwholesome secrets whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy dawn found the ship in sight of sarkomands ruined quays of basalt where a few nightgaunt sentries still waited squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of manthe ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand despatching a messenger for enough nightgaunts to serve them as steeds pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid carter had lent them and carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown kadath and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into doubleheaded images which guard it he spoke of the fear of shantaks for nightgaunts and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide inganok from hateful leng he spoke too of the things he had learnt concerning nightgaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the highpriest not to be described how even the great ones fear them and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at all but hoary and immemorial nodens lord of the great abyssall these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers he wished very much he said for the services of enough nightgaunts to bear him safely through the air past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains and up into the cold waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal he desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him and felt sure that the nightgaunts could take him thither without trouble high above the perils of the plain and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them and even were unexpected things to come from the other gods who are prone to oversee the affairs of earths milder gods the nightgaunts need not fear for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master but bow only to potent and archaic nodensa flock of ten or fifteen nightgaunts carter glibbered would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men the party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth if any ghouls chose to escort him into the throneroom of the great ones he would be thankful for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea he would not however insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself in case the gods proved favourable or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitlesswhilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those nightgaunts for which messengers had been sent the winged horrors settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with its fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at most expected as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned lending him not merely a few of their allied nightgaunts but their entire army as they encamped veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled nightgaunts alike save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea they would set out through the air whenever he might wish and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earths gods in their onyx castlemoved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage the army would fly high they decided over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the shantakfrightening nightgaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits they would then according to what advice they might receive from those denizens choose their final course approaching unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of inganok or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng itself doglike and soulless as they are the ghouls and nightgaunts had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mysteryabout midday the ghouls and nightgaunts prepared for flight each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman and in front of the whole a double line of riderless nightgaunts was provided as a vanguard at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial sarkomand higher and higher till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared and the cold sterile tableland of lengs outskirts laid open to sight still higher flew the black host till even this tableland grew small beneath them and as they worked northward over the windswept plateau of horror carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silkenmasked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the sterile landscape passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved horned almosthumans that dance and pipe eternally therein once they saw a shantakbird flying low over the plain but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panicat dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of inganok and hovered about those strange caves near the summits which carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks at the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and nightgaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures it soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of inganok for lengs northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the nightgaunts dislike abysmal influences centring in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotepof kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard they hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally but of definite data they had nothing to give so carter and his party thanked them kindly and crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of inganok dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rockthere they squatted in a hellish halfcircle their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds sinister wolflike and doubleheaded with faces of fury and right hands raised dully and malignly watching the rim of mans world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not mans from their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of nightgaunts was sighted in the misty sky northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose less and less luminous grew the clouds till at length carter could see only blackness around him but never did the winged steeds falter bred as they were in earths blackest crypts and seeing not with any eyes but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms on and on they flew past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import ever in thickest darkness and covering such prodigious spaces that carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earths dreamlandthen suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above all below was still black but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere it was not that the figures of the constellations were different but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain everything focussed toward the north every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of inganok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence it was more broken now with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles and carter studied closely the suggestive turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urgethey were flying past at a tremendous speed so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party the ghouls had likewise glimpsed it for he heard their low glibbering all about him and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen soon however he saw that this theory would not hold for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird its outline against the stars necessarily vague as it was resembled rather some huge mitred head or pair of heads infinitely magnified and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleftthen came a wide gap in the range where the hideous reaches of transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass through which the stars shone wanly carter watched this gap with intense care knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles the object had now floated ahead a trifle and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in fulllength silhouette gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army for another minute suspense was keen and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and halfchoked meep of cosmic fear and to the soul of the traveller a chill that has never wholly left it for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a heada mitred double headand below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it the mountainhigh monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence the hyaenalike distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky its repulsive pair of conecapped heads reaching half way to the zenithcarter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud for he was an old dreamer but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks bobbing along stealthily after the first one and straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the air the carven mountains then had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of inganok with right hands uplifted they had duties to perform and were not remiss but it was horrible that they never spoke and never even made a sound in walkingmeanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the nightgaunts and the whole army soared higher into the air up toward the stars the grotesque column shot till nothing stood out any longer against the sky neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven and mitred mountains that walked all was blackness beneath as the fluttering legions surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them the farther they went the faster they flew till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasised their northward focus gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance thereinthen he noticed with terror that the wings of the nightgaunts were not flapping any more the horned and faceless steeds had folded their membraneous appendages and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on a force not of earth had seized on the army and ghouls and nightgaunts alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned at length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead thereafter rising steadily as they approached and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the airhigher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it till half the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass lofty as the army was that pale and sinister beacon rose above it towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel no mountain known of man was that which loomed before them the high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills the gasping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven black in eternal night and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment clearer ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliffhigher and higher rose the light till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery all the north beneath it was blackness now dread stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision carter studied the light more closely and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the stars there were towers on that titan mountaintop horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man battlements and terraces of wonder and menace all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought and in it glowed the daemonlight then randolph carter knew that his quest was done and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions the fabulous the incredible home of the great ones atop unknown kadatheven as he realised this thing carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly windsucked party they were rising abruptly now and it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone so close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above and carter could see that it was wellnigh blasphemous in its immensity well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of inganok for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as an ant on the steps of earths loftiest fortress the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow sickly flare so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx the pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse it was a strangely arched window of a design wholly alien to earththe solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated vast walls shot up and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept all was night in the titan courtyard and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx and carter could never tell what cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless arial twisting always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness and never a sound touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery large as the army of ghouls and nightgaunts was it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle and when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon it took carter long to discern the far walls and high distant ceiling and to realise that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outsiderandolph carter had hoped to come into the throneroom of the great ones with poise and dignity flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers he had known that the great ones themselves are not beyond a mortals power to cope with and had trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment as they had so often done before when men sought out earths gods in their home or on their mountains and with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters and that nightgaunts own not nyarlathotep but only archaick nodens for their lord but now he saw that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels and that the other gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild feeble gods of earth void as they are of lordship over ghouls and nightgaunts the mindless shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that randolph carter came into the great ones throneroom with his ghouls swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolvedbefore no golden dais had randolph carter come nor was there any august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes longlobed ears thin nose and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray save for that one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark and the masters were not there carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold waste but he had not found the gods yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin curling mists earths gods were not there it was true but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack where the mild gods are absent the other gods are not unrepresented and certainly the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless in what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could by no means imagine he felt that his visit had been expected and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos nyarlathotep it is nyarlathotep horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods that the fungous moonbeasts serve and carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the jagged rock in the seareflecting upon these things he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that palelitten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet three times pealed that frightful brazen scream and when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw that he was alone whither why and how the ghouls and nightgaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him to divine he knew only that he was suddenly alone and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earths friendly dreamland presently from the chambers uttermost reaches a new sound came this too was a rhythmic trumpeting but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had dissolved his grisly cohorts in this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence odours of incense came to match the golden notes and overhead a great light dawned its colours changing in cycles unknown to earths spectrum and following the song of the trumpet in weird symphonic harmonies torches flared in the distance and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancyout of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incense filed twin columns of giant black slaves with loincloths of iridescent silk upon their heads were strapped vast helmetlike torches of glittering metal from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn armlets and anklets of gold they had and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober gait that they were true black men of earths dreamland was at once apparent but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth ten feet from carter the columns stopped and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearers thick lips wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artificethen down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode a tall slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light close up to carter strode that regal figure whose proud carriage and swart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour it spoke and in its mellow tones there rippled the mild music of lethean streamsrandolph carter said the voice you have come to see the great ones whom it is unlawful for men to see watchers have spoken of this thing and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the daemonsultan whose name no lips dare speak aloudwhen barzai the wise climbed hathegkla to see the great ones dance and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned the other gods were there and they did what was expected zenig of aphorat sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste and his skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not namebut you randolph carter have braved all things of earths dreamland and burn still with the flame of quest you came not as one curious but as one seeking his due nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your dreams and wholly through their own small covetousness for verily they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned and vowed that henceforward no other spot should be their abodethey are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your marvellous city all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades arched bridges and silverbasined fountains and wide streets with blossomladen urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows and when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the towns steep northward slopes where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candlesthe gods love your marvellous city and walk no more in the ways of the gods they have forgotten the high places of earth and the mountains that knew their youth the earth has no longer any gods that are gods and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered kadath far away in a valley of your own childhood randolph carter play the heedless great ones you have dreamed too well o wise archdreamer for you have drawn dreams gods away from the world of all mens visions to that which is wholly yours having builded out of your boyhoods small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone beforeit is not well that earths gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of others fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you randolph carter who are the cause of their upsetting but that they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world in that halfwaking dreamland which is yours no power of uttermost night may pursue and only you can send the selfish great ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city back through the northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold wasteso randolph carter in the name of the other gods i spare you and charge you to serve my will i charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours and to send thence the drowsy truant gods for whom the dreamworld waits not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder for truly it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path behold it is not over unknown seas but back over wellknown years that your quest must go back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sundrenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyesfor know you that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth it is the glory of bostons hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset of the flowerfragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the manybridged charles flows drowsily these things you saw randolph carter when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love and there is antique salem with its brooding years and spectral marblehead scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries and the glory of salems towers and spires seen afar from marbleheads pastures across the harbour against the setting sunthere is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater arkham is there with its mossgrown gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it and antediluvian kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables and the marvel of high cliffs and the milkymisted ocean with tolling buoys beyondcool vales in concord cobbled lanes in portsmouth twilight bends of rustic newhampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking wellsweeps gloucesters salt wharves and truros windy willows vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the north shore hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in rhodeislands back country scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn these randolph carter are your city for they are yourself newengland bore you and into your soul she poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die this loveliness moulded crystallised and polished by years of memory and dreaming is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhoodlook through that window shine the stars of eternal night even now they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream there is antareshe is winking at this moment over the roofs of tremont street and you could see him from your window on beacon hill out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me some day you too may traverse them but if you are wise you will beware such folly for of those mortals who have been and returned only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding clawing horrors of the void terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter you and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been elsewhere busy and certain that you would yourself find the way shun then the outer hells and stick to the calm lovely things of your youth seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant great ones sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth and which wait uneasy for their returneasier even than the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for you see there comes hither a monstrous shantak led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep invisible mount and be readythere yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror steer for that brightest star just south of the zenithit is vega and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city steer for it only till you hear a faroff singing in the high aether higher than that lurks madness so rein your shantak when the first note lures look then back to earth and you will see shining the deathless altarflame of irednaa from the sacred roof of a temple that temple is in your desiderate sunset city so steer for it before you heed the singing and are lostwhen you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the outspread glory prodding the shantak till he cry aloud that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your citys wonders will not console them for the absence of kadaths grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns itthen must you land amongst them with the shantak and let them see and touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown kadath which you will so lately have left and telling them how its boundless halls are lonely and unlighted where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance and the shantak will talk to them in the manner of shantaks but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder daysover and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home and youth till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten thereat can you loose the waiting shantak sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind hearing which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods through the deep gulfs of heaven to kadaths familiar towers and domesthen will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit forever and once more will earths gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat go nowthe casement is open and the stars await outside already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience steer for vega through the night but turn when the singing sounds forget not this warning lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness remember the other gods they are great and mindless and terrible and lurk in the outer voids they are good gods to shunhei aashanta nyghyou are off send back earths gods to their haunts on unknown kadath and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms farewell randolph carter and bewarefor i am nyarlathotep the crawling chaosand randolph carter gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earths dreamland great polypous horrors slid darkly past and unseen batwings beat multitudinous around him but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird the stars danced mockingly almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared before and ever the winds of aether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmosthen through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible there rose a timid hint of faroff melody droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not and as that music grew the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead and carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain it was a song but not the song of any voice night and the spheres sang it and it was old when space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were bornfaster flew the shantak and lower bent the rider drunk with the marvels of strange gulfs and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic then came too late the warning of the evil one the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of those truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at will for madness and the voids wild vengeance are nyarlathoteps only gifts to the presumptuous and frantick though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed that leering tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinitys centre the mindless daemonsultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloudunswerving and obedient to the foul legates orders that hellish bird plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and pawed the nameless larvae of the other gods that are like them blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and thirstsonward unswerving and relentless and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and hysterics into which the siren song of night and the spheres had turned that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider hurtling and shooting cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter and darting meteorlike through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time wherein black azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled maddening beat of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutesonwardonwardthrough the screaming cackling and blackly populous gulfsand then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to randolph carter the doomed too well had nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising for he had brought up

visions of your wistful boyhoodonwardonwarddizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered but the image and the thought had come and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his infancy still lay words came againyou need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood turnturnblackness on every side but randolph carter could turnthick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses randolph carter could turn and move he could move and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of nyarlathotep he could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos core he could turn and move and leaphe couldhe wouldhe wouldoff that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell aeons reeled universes died and were born again stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars and still randolph carter fell through those endless voids of sentient blacknessthen in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into another futile completion and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before matter and light were born anew as space once had known them and comets suns and worlds sprang flaming into life though nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone been and gone always and always back to no first beginningand there was a firmament again and a wind and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the falling dreamer there were gods and presences and wills beauty and evil and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamers boyhood and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things out of the void sngac the violet gas had pointed the way and archaic nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deepsstars swelled to dawns and dawns burst into fountains of gold carmine and purple and still the dreamer fell cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside and hoary nodens raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep close on his quarry stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless huntinghorrors to grey dust randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city for he was come again to the fair new england world that had wrought himso to the organ chords of mornings myriad whistles and dawns blaze thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the state house on the hill randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within his boston room birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his masters start and shriek had disturbed and vast infinities away past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden lands and the cerenerian sea and the twilight reaches of inganok the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city,1
whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams walter gilman did not know behind everything crouched the brooding festering horror of the ancient town and of the mouldy unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed his ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery at night the subtle stirring of the black city outside the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium the darkness always teemed with unexplained soundand yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises which he suspected were lurking behind themhe was in the changeless legendhaunted city of arkham with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the kings men in the dark olden days of the province nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured himfor it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old keziah mason whose flight from salem gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain that was in 1692the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small whitefanged furry thing which scuttled out of keziahs cell and not even cotton mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red sticky fluidpossibly gilman ought not to have studied so hard noneuclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain and when one mixes them with folklore and tries to trace a strange background of multidimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimneycorner one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension gilman came from haverhill but it was only after he had entered college in arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points moreover they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library but all these precautions came late in the day so that gilman had some terrible hints from the dreadednecronomiconof abdul alhazred the fragmentarybook of eibonand the suppressedunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknownhe knew his room was in the old witch housethat indeed was why he had taken it there was much in the essex county records about keziah masons trial and what she had admitted under pressure to the court of oyer and terminer had fascinated gilman beyond all reason she had told judge hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond meadow hill and on the unpeopled island in the river she had spoken also of the black man of her oath and of her new secret name of nahab then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanishedgilman believed strange things about keziah and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than 235 years when he heard the hushed arkham whispers about keziahs persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets about the irregular human toothmarks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses about the childish cries heard near mayeve and hallowmass about the stench often noted in the old houses attic just after those dreaded seasons and about the small furry sharptoothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn he resolved to live in the place at any cost a room was easy to secure for the house was unpopular hard to rent and long given over to cheap lodgings gilman could not have told what he expected to find there but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of planck heisenberg einstein and de sitterhe studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where keziah was held to have practiced her spells it had been vacant from the firstfor no one had ever been willing to stay there longbut the polish landlord had grown wary about renting it yet nothing whatever happened to gilman till about the time of the fever no ghostly keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him and no record of the witchs incantations rewarded his constant search sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved mustysmelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow smallpaned windows here he knew strange things had happened once and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might notat least in the darkest narrowest and most intricately crooked alleyshave utterly perished he also rowed out twice to the illregarded island in the river and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the mossgrown rows of grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorialgilmans room was of good size but queerly irregular shape the north wall slanting perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end while the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction aside from an obvious rathole and the signs of other stoppedup ones there was no accessnor any appearance of a former avenue of accessto the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the houses north side though a view from the exterior shewed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote date the loft above the ceilingwhich must have had a slanting floorwas likewise inaccessible when gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry no amount of persuasion however could induce the stolid landlord to let him investigate either of these two closed spacesas time wore along his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose old keziah he reflected might have had excellent reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know his interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already onthe touch of brainfever and the dreams began early in february for some time apparently the curious angles of gilmans room had been having a strange almost hypnotic effect on him and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the downslanting ceiling met the inwardslanting wall about this period his inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably his apprehensions about the midyear examinations being very acute but the exaggerated sense of hearing was scarcely less annoying life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony and there was that constant terrifying impression ofothersoundsperhaps from regions beyond lifetrembling on the very brink of audibility so far as concrete noises went the rats in the ancient partitions were the worst sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate when it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry rattlingand when it came from the centuryclosed loft above the slanting ceiling gilman always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him utterlythe dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity and gilman felt that they must be a result jointly of his studies in mathematics and in folklore he had been thinking too much about the vague regions which his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know and about the possibility that old keziah masonguided by some influence past all conjecturehad actually found the gate to those regions the yellowed county records containing her testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human experienceand the descriptions of the darting little furry object which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible detailsthat objectno larger than a goodsized rat and quaintly called by the townspeople brown jenkinseemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic herddelusion for in 1692 no less than eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it there were recent rumours too with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat but that its sharptoothed bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like tiny human hands it took messages betwixt old keziah and the devil and was nursed on the witchs bloodwhich it sucked like a vampire its voice was a kind of loathsome titter and it could speak all languages of all the bizarre monstrosities in gilmans dreams nothing filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and diminutive hybrid whose image flitted across his vision in a form a thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking mind had deduced from the ancient records and the modern whispersgilmans dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound abysses whose material and gravitational properties and whose relation to his own entity he could not even begin to explain he did not walk or climb fly or swim crawl or wriggle yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary of his own condition he could not well judge for sight of his arms legs and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective but he felt that his physical organisation and faculties were somehow marvellously transmuted and obliquely projectedthough not without a certain grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and propertiesthe abysses were by no means vacant being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alienhued substance some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic a few of the organic objects tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind though he could form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested in the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared to be divided and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of conductpattern and basic motivation of these categories one seemed to him to include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other categoriesall the objectsorganic and inorganic alikewere totally beyond description or even comprehension gilman sometimes compared the inorganic masses to prisms labyrinths clusters of cubes and planes and cyclopean buildings and the organic things struck him variously as groups of bubbles octopi centipedes living hindoo idols and intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him he felt a stark hideous fright which generally jolted him awake of how the organic entities moved he could tell no more than of how he moved himself in time he observed a further mysterythe tendency of certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space or to disappear totally with equal suddenness the shrieking roaring confusion of sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch timbre or rhythm but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual changes in all the indefinite objects organic and inorganic alike gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure relentlessly inevitable fluctuationsbut it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin that shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the fullest depths of sleep he would be lying in the dark fighting to keep awake when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the centuried room shewing in a violet mist the convergence of angled planes which had seized his brain so insidiously the horror would appear to pop out of the rathole in the corner and patter toward him over the sagging wideplanked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny bearded human facebut mercifully this dream always melted away before the object got close enough to nuzzle him it had hellishly long sharp canine teeth gilman tried to stop up the rathole every day but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction whatever it might be once he had the landlord nail tin over it but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh holein making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bonegilman did not report his fever to the doctor for he knew he could not pass the examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every moment was needed for cramming as it was he failed in calculus d and advanced general psychology though not without hope of making up lost ground before the end of the term it was in march when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary dreaming and the nightmare shape of brown jenkin began to be companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old woman this addition disturbed him more than he could account for but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves on those occasions the evil sardonic and seemingly unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost shiveringespecially the first time when an overgrown rat darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think irrationally of brown jenkin now he reflected those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreamsthat the influence of the old house was unwholesome he could not deny but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there he argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly phantasies and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous visions those visions however were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered he was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both brown jenkin and the old woman and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of greater potencytoward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics though other studies bothered him increasingly he was getting an intuitive knack for solving riemannian equations and astonished professor upham by his comprehension of fourthdimensional and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the transgalactic gulfs themselvesor even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian spacetime continuum gilmans handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity what made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that a man mightgiven mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human acquirementstep deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic patternsuch a step he said would require only two stages first a passage out of the threedimensional sphere we know and second a passage back to the threedimensional sphere at another point perhaps one of infinite remoteness that this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable any being from any part of threedimensional space could probably survive in the fourth dimension and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part of threedimensional space it might select for its reentry denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain otherseven planets belonging to other galaxies or to similardimensional phases of other spacetime continuathough of course there must be vast numbers of mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or zones of spaceit was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensionsbe they within or outside the given spacetime continuumand that the converse would be likewise true this was a matter for speculation though one could be fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next higher plane would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquityhuman or prehumanwhose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than oursaround the first of april gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate he was also troubled by what some of his fellowlodgers said about his sleepwalking it seemed that he was often absent from his bed and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the room below this fellow also spoke of hearing the tread of shod feet in the night but gilman was sure he must have been mistaken in this since shoes as well as other apparel were always precisely in place in the morning one could develop all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old housefor did not gilman himself even in daylight now feel certain that noises other than ratscratchings came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling his pathologically sensitive ears began to listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead and sometimes the illusion of such things was agonisingly realistichowever he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist for twice at night his room had been found vacant though with all his clothing in place of this he had been assured by frank elwood the one fellowstudent whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house elwood had been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on a differential equation only to find gilman absent it had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response but he had needed the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle prodding awake on neither occasion though had gilman been thereand when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering barefoot and with only his nightclothes on he resolved to investigate the matter if reports of his sleepwalking continued and thought of sprinkling flour on the floor of the corridor to see where his footsteps might lead the door was the only conceivable egress for there was no possible foothold outside the narrow windowas april advanced gilmans feversharpened ears were disturbed by the whining prayers of a superstitious loomfixer named joe mazurewicz who had a room on the ground floor mazurewicz had told long rambling stories about the ghost of old keziah and the furry sharpfanged nuzzling thing and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifixgiven him for the purpose by father iwanicki of st stanislaus churchcould bring him relief now he was praying because the witches sabbath was drawing near mayeve was walpurgisnight when hells blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds it was always a very bad time in arkham even though the fine folks up in miskatonic avenue and high and saltonstall streets pretended to know nothing about it there would be bad doingsand a child or two would probably be missing joe knew about such things for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her grandmother it was wise to pray and count ones beads at this season for three months keziah and brown jenkin had not been near joes room nor near paul choynskis room nor anywhere elseand it meant no good when they held off like that they must be up to somethinggilman dropped in at a doctors office on the 16th of the month and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared the physician questioned him sharply and advised him to see a nerve specialist on reflection he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor old waldron who had curtailed his activities before would have made him take a restan impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations he was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the fourth dimension and who could say how much farther he might gobut even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange confidence did all of this perilous sense of imminence come from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day the soft stealthy imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving and now too there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do how about the somnambulism where did he go sometimes in the night and what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while seemed to trickle through the maddening confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad daylight and full wakefulness its rhythm did not correspond to anything on earth unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two unmentionable sabbatchants and sometimes he feared it corresponded to certain attributes of the vague shrieking or roaring in those wholly alien abysses of dreamthe dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious in the lighter preliminary phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness and gilman knew she was the one who had frightened him in the slums her bent back long nose and shrivelled chin were unmistakable and her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered the expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened he must meet the black man and go with them all to the throne of azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos that was what she said he must sign in his own blood the book of azathoth and take a new secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far what kept him from going with her and brown jenkin and the other to the throne of chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name azathoth in thenecronomiconand knew it stood for a primal evil too horrible for descriptionthe old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant she seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted brown jenkin too was always a little nearer at the last and its yellowishwhite fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet phosphorescence its shrill loathsome tittering stuck more and more in gilmans head and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced the words azathoth and nyarlathotepin the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of lifeforms from our own planet including human beings what the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think two of the less irrelevantly moving thingsa rather large congeries of iridescent prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface anglesseemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms labyrinths cubeandplane clusters and quasibuildings and all the while the vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder as if approaching some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensityduring the night of april 1920 the new development occurred gilman was halfinvoluntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubblemass and the small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prismclusters in another second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense diffused green light he was barefooted and in his nightclothes and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet a swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapourthen he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward himthe old woman and the little furry thing the crone strained up to her knees and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion while brown jenkin pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid fore paw which it raised with evident difficulty spurred by an impulse he did not originate gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by the angle of the old womans arms and the direction of the small monstrositys paw and before he had shuffled three steps he was back in the twilight abysses geometrical shapes seethed around him and he fell dizzily and interminably at last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old househe was good for nothing that morning and stayed away from all his classes some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant direction for he could not help staring at a certain vacant spot on the floor as the day advanced the focus of his unseeing eyes changed position and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy about two oclock he went out for lunch and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the southeast only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more stronglyhe would have to consult a nerve specialist after allperhaps there was a connexion with his somnambulismbut meanwhile he might at least try to break the morbid spell himself undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away from the pull so with great resolution he headed against it and dragged himself deliberately north along garrison street by the time he had reached the bridge over the miskatonic he was in a cold perspiration and he clutched at the iron railing as he gazed upstream at the illregarded island whose regular lines of ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlightthen he gave a start for there was a clearly visible living figure on that desolate island and a second glance told him it was certainly the strange old woman whose sinister aspect had worked itself so disastrously into his dreams the tall grass near her was moving too as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground when the old woman began to turn toward him he fled precipitately off the bridge and into the shelter of the towns labyrinthine waterfront alleys distant though the island was he felt that a monstrous and invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent ancient figure in brownthe southeastward pull still held and only with tremendous resolution could gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs for hours he sat silent and aimless with his eyes shifting gradually westward about six oclock his sharpened ears caught the whining prayers of joe mazurewicz two floors below and in desperation he seized his hat and walked out into the sunsetgolden streets letting the now directly southward pull carry him where it might an hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond hangmans brook with the glimmering spring stars shining ahead the urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to leap mystically into space and suddenly he realised just where the source of the pull layit was in the sky a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn in the morning it had been underfoot afternoon found it rising in the southeast and now it was roughly south but wheeling toward the west what was the meaning of this new thing was he going mad how long would it last again mustering his resolution gilman turned and dragged himself back to the sinister old housemazurewicz was waiting for him at the door and seemed both anxious and reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition it was about the witch light joe had been out celebrating the night beforeit was patriots day in massachusettsand had come home after midnight looking up at the house from outside he had thought at first that gilmans window was dark but then he had seen the faint violet glow within he wanted to warn the gentleman about that glow for everybody in arkham knew it was keziahs witch light which played near brown jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself he had not mentioned this before but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her longtoothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman sometimes he and paul choynski and landlord dombrowski thought they saw that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young gentlemans room but they had all agreed not to talk about that however it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like father iwanickias the man rambled on gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat he knew that joe must have been half drunk when he came home the night before yet this mention of a violet light in the garret window was of frightful import it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the dreamluminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion had he himself talked as well as walked around the house in his sleep no joe said he had notbut he must check up on this perhaps frank elwood could tell him something though he hated to askfeverwild dreamssomnambulismillusions of soundsa pull toward a point in the skyand now a suspicion of insane sleeptalking he must stop studying see a nerve specialist and take himself in hand when he climbed to the second story he paused at elwoods door but saw that the other youth was out reluctantly he continued up to his garret room and sat down in the dark his gaze was still pulled to the southwest but he also found himself listening intently for some sound in the closed loft above and half imagining that an evil violet light seeped down through an infinitesimal crack in the low slanting ceilingthat night as gilman slept the violet light broke upon him with heightened intensity and the old witch and small furry thinggetting closer than ever beforemocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish gestures he was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight abysses though the pursuit of that iridescent bubblecongeries and that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and irritating then came the shift as vast converging planes of a slipperylooking substance loomed above and below hima shift which ended in a flash of delirium and a blaze of unknown alien light in which yellow carmine and indigo were madly and inextricably blendedhe was half lying on a high fantastically balustraded terrace above a boundless jungle of outlandish incredible peaks balanced planes domes minarets horizontal discs poised on pinnacles and numberless forms of still greater wildnesssome of stone and some of metalwhich glittered gorgeously in the mixed almost blistering glare from a polychromatic sky looking upward he saw three stupendous discs of flame each of a different hue and at a different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains behind him tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see the city below stretched away to the limits of vision and he hoped that no sound would well up from itthe pavement from which he easily raised himself was of a veined polished stone beyond his power to identify and the tiles were cut in bizarreangled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend the balustrade was chesthigh delicate and fantastically wrought while along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship they like the whole balustrade seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose colour could not be guessed in this chaos of mixed effulgences and their nature utterly defied conjecture they represented some ridged barrelshaped object with thin horizontal arms radiating spokelike from a central ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the head and base of the barrel each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long flat triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfishnearly horizontal but curving slightly away from the central barrel the base of the bottom knob was fused to the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been broken off and were missing the figures were about four and a half inches in height while the spiky arms gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a half incheswhen gilman stood up the tiles felt hot to his bare feet he was wholly alone and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place the sight turned him giddy after a while so that he would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous balustrade his right hand fell on one of the projecting figures the touch seeming to steady him slightly it was too much however for the exotic delicacy of the metalwork and the spiky figure snapped off under his grasp still halfdazed he continued to clutch it as his other hand seized a vacant space on the smooth railingbut now his oversensitive ears caught something behind him and he looked back across the level terrace approaching him softly though without apparent furtiveness were five figures two of which were the sinister old woman and the fanged furry little animal the other three were what sent him unconsciousfor they were living entities about eight feet high shaped precisely like the spiky images on the balustrade and propelling themselves by a spiderlike wriggling of their lower set of starfisharmsgilman awakened in his bed drenched by a cold perspiration and with a smarting sensation in his face hands and feet springing to the floor he washed and dressed in frantic haste as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible he did not know where he wished to go but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes the odd pull toward that spot in the sky between hydra and argo had abated but another of even greater strength had taken its place now he felt that he must go northinfinitely north he dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the miskatonic so went over the peabody avenue bridge very often he stumbled for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty point in the blank blue skyafter about an hour he got himself under better control and saw that he was far from the city all around him stretched the bleak emptiness of salt marshes while the narrow road ahead led to innsmouththat ancient halfdeserted town which arkham people were so curiously unwilling to visit though the northward pull had not diminished he resisted it as he had resisted the other pull and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other plodding back to town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain he dragged himself into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter magazines once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he looked but he did not tell them of his walk at three oclock he took some lunch at a restaurant noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself after that he killed the time at a cheap cinema show seeing the inane performance over and over again without paying any attention to itabout nine at night he drifted homeward and stumbled into the ancient house joe mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers and gilman hastened up to his own garret chamber without pausing to see if elwood was in it was when he turned on the feeble electric light that the shock came at once he saw there was something on the table which did not belong there and a second look left no room for doubt lying on its sidefor it could not stand up alonewas the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade no detail was missing the ridged barrelshaped centre the thin radiating arms the knobs at each end and the flat slightly outwardcurving starfisharms spreading from those knobsall were there in the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of iridescent grey veined with green and gilman could see amidst his horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dreamrailingonly his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear still dazed he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to landlord dombrowskis quarters the whining prayers of the superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls but gilman did not mind them now the landlord was in and greeted him pleasantly no he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it but his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon and maybe that was it dombrowski called her and she waddled in yes that was the thing she had found it in the young gentlemans bedon the side next the wall it had looked very queer to her but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his roombooks and curios and pictures and markings on paper she certainly knew nothing about itso gilman climbed upstairs again in a mental turmoil convinced that he was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places where had he got this outr thing he did not recall seeing it in any museum in arkham it must have been somewhere though and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd dreampicture of the balustraded terrace next day he would make some very guarded inquiriesand perhaps see the nerve specialistmeanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism as he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowedwith a frank admission as to its purposefrom the landlord he had stopped at elwoods door on the way but had found all dark within entering his room he placed the spiky thing on the table and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress from the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding but he was too disorganised even to mind it that cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the skyin the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion this time they actually reached him and he felt the crones withered claws clutching at him he was pulled out of bed and into empty space and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw the twilight amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him but that moment was very brief for presently he was in a crude windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a peak just above his head and with a curious slanting floor underfoot propped level on that floor were low cases full of books of every degree of antiquity and disintegration and in the centre were a table and bench both apparently fastened in place small objects of unknown shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases and in the flaming violet light gilman thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky image which had puzzled him so horribly on the left the floor fell abruptly away leaving a black triangular gulf out of which after a seconds dry rattling there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human facethe evilly grinning beldame still clutched him and beyond the table stood a figure he had never seen beforea tall lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features wholly devoid of either hair or beard and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench but he must have been shod since there was a clicking whenever he changed position the man did not speak and bore no trace of expression on his small regular features he merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into gilmans right hand over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamers clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff as the blood spurted from this wound gilman lapsed into a fainthe awaked on the morning of the 22nd with a pain in his left wrist and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood his recollections were very confused but the scene with the black man in the unknown space stood out vividly the rats must have bitten him as he slept giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream opening the door he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the other end of the garret so he had not been sleepwalking this time but something would have to be done about those rats he would speak to the landlord about them again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size his ears were ringing horribly as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreamsas he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in the violetlitten space but nothing definite would crystallise in his mind that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead which had begun to attack his imagination so violently but later impressions were faint and hazy there were suggestions of the vague twilight abysses and of still vaster blacker abysses beyond themabysses in which all fixed suggestions of form were absent he had been taken there by the bubblecongeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him but they like himself had changed to wisps of milky barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness something else had gone on aheada larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of formand he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos eventually there had been a hint of vast leaping shadows of a monstrous halfacoustic pulsing and of the thin monotonous piping of an unseen flutebut that was all gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in thenecronomiconabout the mindless entity azathoth which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of chaoswhen the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight and gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures it occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lainwhich was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff had he been sleepwalking within his room and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position he looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains but did not find any he had better he thought sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the doorthough after all no further proof of his sleepwalking was needed he knew he did walkand the thing to do now was to stop it he must ask frank elwood for help this morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable it was a vague insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly as he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger but even so it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urgehe took the spiky image down to elwoods room steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor elwood was in thank heaven and appeared to be stirring about there was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college so gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears his host was very sympathetic and agreed that something ought to be done he was shocked by his guests drawn haggard aspect and noticed the queer abnormallooking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week there was not much though that he could say he had not seen gilman on any sleepwalking expedition and had no idea what the curious image could be he had though heard the frenchcanadian who lodged just under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening they were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of walpurgisnight now only a few days off and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor doomed young gentleman desrochers the fellow under gilmans room had spoken of nocturnal footsteps both shod and unshod and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through gilmans keyhole he had not dared to peer he told mazurewicz after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door there had been soft talking tooand as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisperelwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping but supposed their imaginations had been roused by gilmans late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand and by the nearness of traditionally feared mayeve on the other hand that gilman talked in his sleep was plain and it was obviously from desrochers keyholelistenings that the delusive notion of the violet dreamlight had got abroad these simple people were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about as for a plan of actiongilman had better move down to elwoods room and avoid sleeping alone elwood would if awake rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep very soon too he must see the specialist meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain professors seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public rubbishcan also dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the wallsbraced up by elwoods companionship gilman attended classes that day strange urges still tugged at him but he could sidetrack them with considerable success during a free period he shewed the queer image to several professors all of whom were intensely interested though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin that night he slept on a couch which elwood had had the landlord bring to the secondstory room and for the first time in weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams but the feverishness still hung on and the whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influenceduring the next few days gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations he had elwood said shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep and meanwhile the landlord was putting ratpoison everywhere the only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners whose imaginations had become highly excited mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix and finally forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good father iwanicki desrochers too had something to sayin fact he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of gilmans absence from it paul choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night and claimed that his door had been softly tried while mrs dombrowski vowed she had seen brown jenkin for the first time since allhallows but such naive reports could mean very little and gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his hosts dresserfor three days gilman and elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image but always without success in every quarter however interest was intense for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity one of the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical analysis and the result is still talked about in college circles professor ellery found platinum iron and tellurium in the strange alloy but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify not only did they fail to correspond with any known element but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for probable elements in the periodic system the mystery remains unsolved to this day though the image is on exhibition at the museum of miskatonic universityon the morning of april 27 a fresh rathole appeared in the room where gilman was a guest but dombrowski tinned it up during the day the poison was not having much effect for scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished elwood was out late that night and gilman waited up for him he did not wish to go to sleep in a room aloneespecially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams he wondered who she was and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a rubbishheap at the mouth of a squalid courtyard the crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at himthough perhaps this was merely his imaginationthe next day both youths felt very tired and knew they would sleep like logs when night came in the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed gilman and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable they spoke of old keziah mason and elwood agreed that gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant information the hidden cults to which these witches belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder forgotten aeons and it was by no means impossible that keziah had actually mastered the art of passing through dimensional gates tradition emphasises the uselessness of material barriers in halting a witchs motions and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the nightwhether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical research alone was still to be seen success gilman added might lead to dangerous and unthinkable situations for who could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally inaccessible dimension on the other hand the picturesque possibilities were enormous time could not exist in certain belts of space and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve ones life and age indefinitely never suffering organic metabolism or deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to ones own or similar planes one might for example pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earths history as young as beforewhether anybody had ever managed to do this one could hardly conjecture with any degree of authority old legends are hazy and ambiguous and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and messengers from outside there was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powersthe black man of the witchcult and the nyarlathotep of thenecronomiconthere was too the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediariesthe quasianimals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches familiars as gilman and elwood retired too sleepy to argue further they heard joe mazurewicz reel into the house halfdrunk and shuddered at the desperate wildness of his whining prayersthat night gilman saw the violet light again in his dream he had heard a scratching and gnawing in the partitions and thought that someone fumbled clumsily at the latch then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor the beldames face was alight with inhuman exultation and the little yellowtoothed morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavily sleeping form of elwood on the other couch across the room a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out as once before the hideous crone seized gilman by the shoulders yanking him out of bed and into empty space again the infinitude of the shrieking twilight abysses flashed past him but in another second he thought he was in a dark muddy unknown alley of foetid odours with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on every handahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man which the deep mud largely concealed there was a dark open doorway on the right to which the black man silently pointed into this the grimacing crone started dragging gilman after her by his pajama sleeve there were evilsmelling staircases which creaked ominously and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light and finally a door leading off a landing the crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the door open motioning to gilman to wait and disappearing inside the black aperturethe youths oversensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry and presently the beldame came out of the room bearing a small senseless form which she thrust at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it the sight of this form and the expression on its face broke the spell still too dazed to cry out he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man as consciousness departed he heard the faint shrill tittering of the fanged ratlike abnormalityon the morning of the 29th gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror the instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall and ceiling sprawled on the now unmade bed his throat was aching inexplicably and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajamabottoms were brown with caked mud for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy but he knew at least that he must have been sleepwalking elwood had been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him on the floor were confused muddy prints but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door the more gilman looked at them the more peculiar they seemed for in addition to those he could recognise as his there were some smaller almost round markingssuch as the legs of a large chair or table might make except that most of them tended to be divided into halves there were also some curious muddy rattracks leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again utter bewilderment and the fear of madness racked gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were no muddy prints outside the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors belowdescending to elwoods room he roused his stillsleeping host and began telling of how he had found himself but elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened where gilman could have been how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall and how the muddy furniturelike prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber were wholly beyond conjecture then there were those dark livid marks on his throat as if he had tried to strangle himself he put his hands up to them but found that they did not even approximately fit while they were talking desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours no there had been no one on the stairs after midnightthough just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret and cautiously descending steps he did not like it was he added a very bad time of year for arkham the young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him even the daytime was not safe for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the houseespecially a thin childish wail hastily choked offgilman mechanically attended classes that morning but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies a mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had seized him and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow at noon he lunched at the university spa picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert but he never ate that dessert for an item on the papers first page left him limp wildeyed and able only to pay his check and stagger back to elwoods roomthere had been a strange kidnapping the night before in ornes gangway and the twoyearold child of a clodlike laundry worker named anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight the mother it appeared had feared the event for some time but the reasons she assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them seriously she had she said seen brown jenkin about the place now and then ever since early in march and knew from its grimaces and titterings that little ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the awful sabbat on walpurgisnight she had asked her neighbour mary czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child but mary had not dared she could not tell the police for they never believed such things children had been taken that way every year ever since she could remember and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way anyhowbut what threw gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after midnight they admitted they had been drunk but both vowed they had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway there had they said been a huge robed negro a little old woman in rags and a young white man in his nightclothes the old woman had been dragging the youth while around the feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mudgilman sat in a daze all the afternoon and elwoodwho had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from themfound him thus when he came home this time neither could doubt but that something hideously serious was closing in around them between the phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallising and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments gilman must see a specialist sooner or later but not just now when all the papers were full of this kidnapping businessjust what had really happened was maddeningly obscure and for a moment both gilman and elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest kind had gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his studies of space and its dimensions had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable whereif anywherehad he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage the roaring twilight abyssesthe green hillsidethe blistering terracethe pulls from the starsthe ultimate black vortexthe black manthe muddy alley and the stairsthe old witch and the fanged furry horrorthe bubblecongeries and the little polyhedronthe strange sunburnthe wrist woundthe unexplained imagethe muddy feetthe throatmarksthe tales and fears of the superstitious foreignerswhat did all this mean to what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a casethere was no sleep for either of them that night but next day they both cut classes and drowsed this was april 30th and with the dusk would come the hellish sabbattime which all the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared mazurewicz came home at six oclock and said people at the mill were whispering that the walpurgisrevels would be held in the dark ravine beyond meadow hill where the old white stone stands in a place queerly void of all plantlife some of them had even told the police and advised them to look there for the missing wolejko child but they did not believe anything would be done joe insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his nickelchained crucifix and gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to humour the fellowlate at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs lulled by the rhythmical praying of the loomfixer on the floor below gilman listened as he nodded his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for some subtle dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house unwholesome recollections of things in thenecronomiconand the black book welled up and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehendpresently he realised what he was listening forthe hellish chant of the celebrants in the distant black valley how did he know so much about what they expected how did he know the time when nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black goat he saw that elwood had dropped asleep and tried to call out and waken him something however closed his throat he was not his own master had he signed the black mans book after allthen his fevered abnormal hearing caught the distant windborne notes over miles of hill and field and alley they came but he recognised them none the less the fires must be lit and the dancers must be starting in how could he keep himself from going what was it that had enmeshed him mathematicsfolklorethe houseold keziahbrown jenkin and now he saw that there was a fresh rathole in the wall near his couch above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of joe mazurewicz came another sounda stealthy determined scratching in the partitions he hoped the electric lights would not go out then he saw the fanged bearded little face in the ratholethe accursed little face which he at last realised bore such a shocking mocking resemblance to old keziahsand heard the faint fumbling at the doorthe screaming twilight abysses flashed before him and he felt himself helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubblecongeries ahead raced the small kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax he seemed to know what was comingthe monstrous burst of walpurgisrhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal ultimate spacetime seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periodsbut all this vanished in a second he was again in the cramped violetlitten peaked space with the slanting floor the low cases of ancient books the bench and table the queer objects and the triangular gulf at one side on the table lay a small white figurean infant boy unclothed and unconsciouswhile on the other side stood the monstrous leering old woman with a gleaming grotesquehafted knife in her right hand and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her left she was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which gilman could not understand but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in thenecronomiconas the scene grew clear he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the empty bowl across the tableand unable to control his own motions he reached far forward and took it in both hands noticing as he did so its comparative lightness at the same moment the disgusting form of brown jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left the crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach the fanged furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual while the witch croaked loathsome responses gilman felt a gnawing poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp a second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely and he dropped the bowl with a resounding belllike clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deedin an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the knife from the old womans claws sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf in another instant however matters were reversed for those murderous claws had locked themselves tightly around his own throat while the wrinkled face was twisted with insane fury he felt the chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck and in his peril wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature her strength was altogether superhuman but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol snapping the chain and pulling it freeat sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic and her grip relaxed long enough to give gilman a chance to break it entirely he pulled the steellike claws from his neck and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again this time he resolved to reply in kind and his own hands reached out for the creatures throat before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix twisted about her neck and a moment later he had tightened it enough to cut off her breath during her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle and saw that brown jenkin had come to her aid with one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far belowwhether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know but he let her rest on the floor where she had fallen then as he turned away he saw on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his reason brown jenkin tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity had been busy while the witch was throttling him and his efforts had been in vain what he had prevented the knife from doing to the victims chest the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy had done to a wristand the bowl so lately on the floor stood full beside the small lifeless bodyin his dreamdelirium gilman heard the hellish alienrhythmed chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance and knew the black man must be there confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics and he believed his subconscious mind held theangleswhich he needed to guide him back to the normal worldalone and unaided for the first time he felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own room but whether he could ever escape through the slanting floor or the longstopped egress he doubted greatly besides would not an escape from a dreamloft bring him merely into a dreamhousean abnormal projection of the actual place he sought he was wholly bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiencesthe passage through the vague abysses would be frightful for the walpurgisrhythm would be vibrating and at last he would have to hear that hitherto veiled cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded even now he could detect a low monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well at sabbattime it always mounted and reached through to the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites half the chants of the sabbat were patterned on this faintly overheard pulsing which no earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness gilman wondered too whether he could trust his instinct to take him back to the right part of space how could he be sure he would not land on that greenlitten hillside of a far planet on the tessellated terrace above the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of chaos wherein reigns the mindless daemonsultan azathothjust before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness the witchold keziahnahabthat must have meant her death and mixed with the distant chant of the sabbat and the whimpers of brown jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard another and wilder whine from unknown depths joe mazurewiczthe prayers against the crawling chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant shriekworlds of sardonic actuality impinging on vortices of febrile dreami shubniggurath the goat with a thousand young they found gilman on the floor of his queerly angled old garret room long before dawn for the terrible cry had brought desrochers and choynski and dombrowski and mazurewicz at once and had even wakened the soundly sleeping elwood in his chair he was alive and with open staring eyes but seemed largely unconscious on his throat were the marks of murderous hands and on his left ankle was a distressing ratbite his clothing was badly rumpled and joes crucifix was missing elwood trembled afraid even to speculate on what new form his friends sleepwalking had taken mazurewicz seemed halfdazed because of a sign he said he had had in response to his prayers and he crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from beyond the slanting partitionwhen the dreamer was settled on his couch in elwoods room they sent for dr malkowskia local practitioner who would repeat no tales where they might prove embarrassingand he gave gilman two hypodermic injections which caused him to relax in something like natural drowsiness during the day the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to elwood it was a painful process and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting factgilmanwhose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitivenesswas now stone deaf dr malkowski summoned again in haste told elwood that both eardrums were ruptured as if by the impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception or endurance how such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours without arousing all the miskatonic valley was more than the honest physician could sayelwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper so that a fairly easy communication was maintained neither knew what to make of the whole chaotic business and decided it would be better if they thought as little as possible about it both though agreed that they must leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged evening papers spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a ravine beyond meadow hill just before dawn and mentioned that the white stone there was an object of agelong superstitious regard nobody had been caught but among the scattering fugitives had been glimpsed a huge negro in another column it was stated that no trace of the missing child ladislas wolejko had been foundthe crowning horror came that very night elwood will never forget it and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous breakdown he had thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening but paid little attention to them then long after both he and gilman had retired the atrocious shrieking began elwood jumped up turned on the lights and rushed over to his guests couch the occupant was emitting sounds of veritably inhuman nature as if racked by some torment beyond description he was writhing under the bedclothes and a great red stain was beginning to appear on the blanketselwood scarcely dared to touch him but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided by this time dombrowski choynski desrochers mazurewicz and the topfloor lodger were all crowding into the doorway and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for dr malkowski everybody shrieked when a large ratlike form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh open hole close by when the doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers walter gilman was deadit would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed gilman there had been virtually a tunnel through his bodysomething had eaten his heart out dombrowski frantic at the failure of his constant ratpoisoning efforts cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in walnut street the worst thing for a while was keeping joe mazurewicz quiet for the brooding loomfixer would never stay sober and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible thingsit seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson rattracks which led from gilmans couch to the nearby hole on the carpet they were very indistinct but a piece of open flooring intervened between the carpets edge and the baseboard there mazurewicz had found something monstrousor thought he had for no one else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the prints the tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the average prints of a rat but even choynski and desrochers would not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human handsthe house was never rented again as soon as dombrowski left it the pall of its final desolation began to descend for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid odour perhaps the exlandlords ratpoison had worked after all for not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside the eastern garret room and agreed that the number of dead rats must be enormous they decided however that it was not worth their while to hew open and disinfect the longsealed spaces for the foetor would soon be over and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards indeed there were always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in the witch house just after mayeve and hallowmass the neighbours grumblingly acquiesced in the inertiabut the foetor none the less formed an additional count against the place toward the last the house was condemned as an habitation by the building inspectorgilmans dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been explained elwood whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening came back to college the next autumn and graduated in the following june he found the spectral gossip of the town much diminished and it is indeed a fact thatnotwithstanding certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itselfno fresh appearances either of old keziah or of brown jenkin have been muttered of since gilmans death it is rather fortunate that elwood was not in arkham in that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors of course he heard about the matter afterward and suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation but even that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights would have beenin march 1931 a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant witch house so that a chaos of crumbling bricks blackened mossgrown shingles and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the floor beneath the whole attic story was choked with debris from above but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure that ultimate step came in the following december and it was when gilmans old room was cleared out by reluctant apprehensive workmen that the gossip beganamong the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in the police later the police in turn called in the coroner and several professors from the university there were bonesbadly crushed and splintered but clearly recognisable as humanwhose manifestly modern date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only possible lurkingplace the low slantfloored loft overhead had supposedly been sealed from all human access the coroners physician decided that some belonged to a small child while certain othersfound mixed with shreds of rotten brownish clothbelonged to a rather undersized bent female of advanced years careful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse as well as older ratbones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of controversy and reflectionother objects found included the mingled fragments of many books and papers together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers all without exception appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones an even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed archaic writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of at least 150 to 200 years to some though the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objectsobjects whose shapes materials types of workmanship and purposes baffle all conjecturefound scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury one of these thingswhich excited several miskatonic professors profoundlyis a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which gilman gave to the college museum save that it is larger wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphicsarchaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by joe mazurewicz as that which he had given poor gilman many years before some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of gilmans old room all the time still others including joe himself have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credencewhen the slanting wall of gilmans room was torn out the once sealed triangular space between that partition and the houses north wall was found to contain much less structural debris even in proportion to its size than the room itself though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror in brief the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small childrensome fairly modern but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete on this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size obvious antiquity and grotesque ornate and exotic designabove which the debris was piledin the midst of this debris wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney was an object destined to cause more bafflement veiled fright and openly superstitious talk in arkham than anything else discovered in the haunted and accursed building this object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence among the members of miskatonics department of comparative anatomy very little concerning this skeleton has leaked out but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the long brownish hairs with which it was associatedthe bones of the tiny paws it is rumoured imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness appearing from certain angles like a miniature monstrously degraded parody of a human skull the workmen crossed themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy but later burned candles of gratitude in st stanislaus church because of the shrill ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again,1

massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the aylesbury pike just beyond deans corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country the ground gets higher and the brierbordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty curving road the trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large and the wild weeds brambles and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions at the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age squalor and dilapidation without knowing why one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping rockstrown meadows those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things with which it would be better to have nothing to do when a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased the summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crownedgorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety when the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs the thin shining line of the miskatonics upper reaches has an oddly serpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it risesas the hills draw nearer one heeds their wooded sides more than their stonecrowned tops those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance but there is no road by which to escape them across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region it is not reassuring to see on a closer glance that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin and that the brokensteepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge yet there is no way to avoid it once across it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint malign odour about the village street as of the massed mould and decay of centuries it is always a relief to get clear of the place and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwichoutsiders visit dunwich as seldom as possible and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down the scenery judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon is more than commonly beautiful yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists two centuries ago when talk of witchblood satanworship and strange forest presences was not laughed at it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality in our sensible agesince the dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the towns and the worlds welfare at heartpeople shun it without knowing exactly why perhaps one reasonthough it cannot apply to uninformed strangersis that the natives are now repellently decadent having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many new england backwaters they have come to form a race by themselves with the welldefined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding the average of their intelligence is woefully low whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of halfhidden murders incests and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity the old gentry representing the two or three armigerous families which came from salem in 1692 have kept somewhat above the general level of decay though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace some of the whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to harvard and miskatonic though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were bornno one even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror can say just what is the matter with dunwich though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the indians amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below in 1747 the reverend abijah hoadley newly come to the congregational church at dunwich village preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of satan and his imps in which he saidit must be allowd that these blasphemies of an infernall train of daemons are matters of too common knowledge to be denyd the cursed voices ofazazelandbuzraelofbeelzebubandbelialbeing heard now from under ground by above a score of credible witnesses now living i my self did not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain discourse of evill powers in the hill behind my house wherein there were a rattling and rolling groaning screeching and hissing such as no things of this earth coud raise up and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magick can discover and only the divell unlockmr hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon but the text printed in springfield is still extant noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographersother traditions tell of foul odours near the hillcrowning circles of stone pillars and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines while still others try to explain the devils hop yarda bleak blasted hillside where no tree shrub or grassblade will grow then too the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights it is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferers struggling breath if they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter but if they fail they subside gradually into a disappointed silencethese tales of course are obsolete and ridiculous because they come down from very old times dunwich is indeed ridiculously oldolder by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house which was built before 1700 whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls built in 1806 form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen industry did not flourish here and the nineteenthcentury factory movement proved shortlived oldest of all are the great rings of roughhewn stone columns on the hilltops but these are more generally attributed to the indians than to the settlers deposits of skulls and bones found within these circles and around the sizeable tablelike rock on sentinel hill sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burialplaces of the pocumtucks even though many ethnologists disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory persist in believing the remains caucasianiiit was in the township of dunwich in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling that wilbur whateley was born at 5 am on sunday the second of february 1913 this date was recalled because it was candlemas which people in dunwich curiously observe under another name and because the noises in the hills had sounded and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently throughout the night before less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent whateleys a somewhat deformed unattractive albino woman of thirtyfive living with an aged and halfinsane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth lavinia whateley had no known husband but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk mightand didspeculate as widely as they chose on the contrary she seemed strangely proud of the dark goatishlooking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pinkeyed albinism and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous futurelavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of whateleys and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes she had never been to school but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that old whateley had taught her the remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old whateleys reputation for black magic and the unexplained death by violence of mrs whateley when lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular isolated among strange influences lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular occupations nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappearedthere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs barking on the night wilbur was born but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward when old whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into dunwich village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at osborns general store there seemed to be a change in the old manan added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fearthough he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter and what he said of the childs paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterwardi dunt keer what folks thinkef lavinnys

day yew folksll hear a child o lavinnys acallin its fathers name on the top o sentinel hillthe only persons who saw wilbur during the first month of his life were old zechariah whateley of the undecayed whateleys and earl sawyers commonlaw wife mamie bishop mamies visit was frankly one of curiosity and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis this marked the beginning of a course of cattlebuying on the part of small wilburs family which ended only in 1928 when the dunwich horror came and went yet at no time did the ramshackle whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock there came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic bloodlesslooking specimens evidently some blight or distemper perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn caused a heavy mortality amongst the whateley animals odd wounds or sores having something of the aspect of incisions seemed to afflict the visible cattle and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey unshaven old man and his slatternly crinklyhaired albino daughterin the spring after wilburs birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child public interest in the whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit wilburs growth was indeed phenomenal for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age his motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant and no one was really unprepared when at seven months he began to walk unassisted with falterings which another month was sufficient to removeit was somewhat after this timeon halloweenthat a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill where the old tablelike stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones considerable talk was started when silas bishopof the undecayed bishopsmentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked silas was rounding up a stray heifer but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern they darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed afterward he could not be sure about the boy who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm his contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasonsthe next january gossips were mildly interested in the fact that lavinnys black brat had commenced to talk and at the age of only eleven months his speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud the boy was not talkative yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by dunwich and its denizens the strangeness did not reside in what he said or even in the simple idioms he used but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds his facial aspect too was remarkable for its maturity for though he shared his mothers and grandfathers chinlessness his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large dark almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasiadulthood and wellnigh preternatural intelligence he was however exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips largepored yellowish skin coarse crinkly hair and oddly elongated ears he was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of old whateley and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name ofyogsothothin the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him dogs abhorred the boy and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menaceiiimeanwhile old whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd he also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his housea spacious peakedroofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside and whose three leastruined groundfloor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter there must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour and though he still babbled dementedly at times his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born when one of the many toolsheds had been put suddenly in order clapboarded and fitted with a stout fresh lock now in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house he was a no less thorough craftsman his mania shewed itself only in his tight boardingup of all the windows in the reclaimed sectionthough many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandsona room which several callers saw though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story this chamber he lined with tall firm shelving along which he began gradually to arrange in apparently careful order all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various roomsi made some use of em he would say as he tried to mend a torn blackletter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove but the boys fitten to make better use of em hed orter hev em as well sot as he kin for theyre goin to be all of his larninwhen wilbur was a year and seven months oldin september of 1914his size and accomplishments were almost alarming he had grown as large as a child of four and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker he ran freely about the fields and hills and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings at home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfathers books while old whateley would instruct and catechise him through long hushed afternoons by this time the restoration of the house was finished and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door it was a window in the rear of the east gable end close against the hill and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground about the period of this works completion people noticed that the old toolhouse tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since wilburs birth had been abandoned again the door swung listlessly open and when earl sawyer once stepped within after a cattleselling call on old whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encounteredsuch a stench he averred as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the indian circles on the hills and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth but then the homes and sheds of dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculatenessthe following months were void of visible events save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises on mayeve of 1915 there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt whilst the following halloween produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flamethem witch whateleys doinsfrom the summit of sentinel hill wilbur was growing up uncannily so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year he read avidly by himself now but talked much less than formerly a settled taciturnity was absorbing him and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face he would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror the aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety his occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardiansthe few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boardedup second story she would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fishpeddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway that peddler told the store loungers at dunwich village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above the loungers reflected thinking of the door and runway and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared then they shuddered as they recalled tales of old whateleys youth and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personallyin 1917 the war came and squire sawyer whateley as chairman of the local draft board had hard work finding a quota of young dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp the government alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence sent several officers and medical experts to investigate conducting a survey which new england newspaper readers may still recall it was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the whateleys and caused theboston globeandarkham advertiserto print flamboyant sunday stories of young wilburs precociousness old whateleys black magic the shelves of strange books the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises wilbur was four and a half then and looked like a lad of fifteen his lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down and his voice had begun to breakearl sawyer went out to the whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces it was he said exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared and grinned over the obvious mistakes they wondered too why the writers made so much of the fact that old whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date the whateleys had received their visitors with illconcealed distaste though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talkivfor a decade the annals of the whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their mayeve and allhallows orgies twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse in the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside worlds attention to themselvesabout 1923 when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind voice stature and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house it was all inside the sealed upper part and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof they had torn down the great central chimney too and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipein the spring after this event old whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of cold spring glen to chirp under his window at night he seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance and told the loungers at osborns that he thought his time had almost comethey whistle jest in tune with my breathin naow he said an i guess theyre gittin ready to ketch my soul they know its agoin aout an dunt calclate to miss it yewll know boys arter im gone whether they git me er not ef they dew theyll keep up asingin an laffin till break o day ef they dunt theyll kinder quiet daown like i expeck them an the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimeson lammas night 1924 dr houghton of aylesbury was hastily summoned by wilbur whateley who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from osborns in the village he found old whateley in a very grave state with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off the shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping as of the waves on some level beach the doctor though was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man it was uncanny and unnaturaltoo much thought dr houghton like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent calltoward one oclock old whateley gained consciousness and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandsonmore space willy more space soon yew growsanthatgrows faster itll be ready to sarve ye soon boy open up the gates to yogsothoth with the long chant that yell find on page 751of the complete editionanthenput a match to the prison fire from airth cant burn it nohaowhe was obviously quite mad after a pause during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off he added another sentence or twofeed it reglar willy an mind the quantity but dunt let it grow too fast fer the place fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to yogsothoth its all over an no use only them from beyont kin make it multiply an work only them the old uns as wants to come back but speech gave place to gasps again and lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change it was the same for more than an hour when the final throaty rattle came dr houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence lavinia sobbed but wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintlythey didnt git him he muttered in his heavy bass voicewilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his onesided way and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept he was more and more hated and dreaded around dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of oldtime gold which still as in his grandfathers time went forth regularly and increasingly for cattlebuying he was now tremendously mature of aspect and his height having reached the normal adult limit seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure in 1925 when a scholarly correspondent from miskatonic university called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled he was fully six and threequarters feet tallthrough all the years wilbur had treated his halfdeformed albino mother with a growing contempt finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on mayeve and hallowmass and in 1926 the poor creature complained to mamie bishop of being afraid of himtheys more abaout him as i knows than i kin tell ye mamie she said an naowadays theys more nor what i know myself i vaow afur gawd i dunt know what he wants nor what hes atryin to dewthat halloween the hill noises sounded louder than ever and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse after midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside and not until dawn did they finally quiet down then they vanished hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue what this meant no one could quite be certain till later none of the country folk seemed to have diedbut poor lavinia whateley the twisted albino was never seen againin the summer of 1927 wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them soon afterward earl sawyer told the loungers at osborns that more carpentry was going on in the whateley farmhouse wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before he was living in one of the sheds and sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous people generally suspected him of knowing something about his mothers disappearance and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now his height had increased to more than seven feet and shewed no signs of ceasing its developmentvthe following winter brought an event no less strange than wilburs first trip outside the dunwich region correspondence with the widener library at harvard the bibliothque nationale in paris the british museum the university of buenos ayres and the library of miskatonic university of arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted so at length he set out in person shabby dirty bearded and uncouth of dialect to consult the copy at miskatonic which was the nearest to him geographically almost eight feet tall and carrying a cheap new valise from osborns general store this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college librarythe hideousnecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius latin version as printed in spain in the seventeenth century he had never seen a city before but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds where indeed he passed heedlessly by the great whitefanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity and tugged frantically at its stout chainwilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of dr dees english version which his grandfather had bequeathed him and upon receiving access to the latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume this much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarianthe same erudite henry armitage am miskatonic ph d princeton litt d johns hopkins who had once called at the farm and who now politely plied him with questions he was looking he had to admit for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful nameyogsothothand it puzzled him to find discrepancies duplications and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy as he copied the formula he finally chose dr armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages the lefthand one of which in the latin version contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the worldnor is it to be thought ran the text as armitage mentally translated it that man is either the oldest or the last of earths masters or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone the old ones were the old ones are and the old ones shall be not in the spaces we know

what he had heard of dunwich and its brooding presences and of wilbur whateley and his dim hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tombs cold clamminess the bent goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension like something only partly of mankind and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter space and time presently wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange resonant fashion which hinted at soundproducing organs unlike the run of mankindsmr armitage he said i calclate ive got to take that book home theys things in it ive got to try under sarten conditions that i cant git here an it ud be a mortal sin to let a redtape rule hold me up let me take it along sir an ill swar they wunt nobody know the difference i dunt need to tell ye ill take good keer of it it want me that put this dee copy in the shape it is he stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarians face and his own goatish features grew crafty armitage halfready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself there was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres whateley saw how things stood and tried to answer lightlywal all right ef ye feel that way abaout it maybe harvard wunt be so fussy as yew be and without saying more he rose and strode out of the building stooping at each doorwayarmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog and studied whateleys gorillalike lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window he thought of the wild tales he had heard and recalled the old sunday stories in theadvertiserthese things and the lore he had picked up from dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there unseen things not of earthor at least not of tridimensional earthrushed foetid and horrible through new englands glens and brooded obscenely on the mountaintops of this he had long felt certain now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare he locked away thenecronomiconwith a shudder of disgust but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench as a foulness shall ye know them he quoted yesthe odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the whateley farmhouse less than three years before he thought of wilbur goatish and ominous once again and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentageinbreeding armitage muttered halfaloud to himself great god what simpletons shew them arthur machens great god pan and theyll think it a common dunwich scandal but what thingwhat cursed shapeless influence on or off this threedimensioned earthwas wilbur whateleys father born on candlemasnine months after mayeve of 1912 when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to arkham what walked on the mountains that maynight what roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in halfhuman flesh and bloodduring the ensuing weeks dr armitage set about to collect all possible data on wilbur whateley and the formless presences around dunwich he got in communication with dr houghton of aylesbury who had attended old whateley in his last illness and found much to ponder over in the grandfathers last words as quoted by the physician a visit to dunwich village failed to bring out much that was new but a close survey of thenecronomiconin those parts which wilbur had sought so avidly seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature methods and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet talks with several students of archaic lore in boston and letters to many others elsewhere gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear as the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper miskatonic valley and about the monstrous being known to the human world as wilbur whateleyvithe dunwich horror itself came between lammas and the equinox in 1928 and dr armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue he had heard meanwhile of whateleys grotesque trip to cambridge and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from thenecronomiconat the widener library those efforts had been in vain since armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume wilbur had been shockingly nervous at cambridge anxious for the book yet almost equally anxious to get home again as if he feared the results of being away longearly in august the halfexpected outcome developed and in the small hours of the 3d dr armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus deep and terrible the snarling halfmad growls and barks continued always in mounting volume but with hideously significant pauses then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throatsuch a scream as roused half the sleepers of arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwardsuch a scream as could come from no being born of earth or wholly of eartharmitage hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings saw that others were ahead of him and heard the echoes of a burglaralarm still shrilling from the library an open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight what had come had indeed completed its entrance for the barking and the screaming now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning proceeded unmistakably from within some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door among the others he saw professor warren rice and dr francis morgan men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings and these two he motioned to accompany him inside the inward sounds except for a watchful droning whine from the dog had by this time quite subsided but armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying manthe building was full of a frightful stench which dr armitage knew too well and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical readingroom whence the low whining came for a second nobody dared to turn on the light then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch one of the threeit is not certain whichshrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs professor rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant though he did not stumble or fallthe thing that lay halfbent on its side in a foetid pool of greenishyellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin it was not quite dead but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside bits of shoeleather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown near the central desk a revolver had fallen a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired the thing itself however crowded out all other images at the time it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common lifeforms of this planet and of the three known dimensions it was partly human beyond a doubt with very manlike hands and head and the goatish chinless face had the stamp of the whateleys upon it but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicatedabove the waist it was semianthropomorphic though its chest where the dogs rending paws still rested watchfully had the leathery reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator the back was piebald with yellow and black and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes below the waist though it was the worst for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur and from the abdomen a score of long greenishgrey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply their arrangement was odd and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system on each of the hips deep set in a kind of pinkish ciliated orbit was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat the limbs save for their black fur roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earths giant saurians and terminated in ridgyveined pads that were neither hooves nor claws when the thing breathed its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour as if from some circulatory cause normal to the nonhuman side of its ancestry in the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyishwhite in the spaces between the purple rings of genuine blood there was none only the foetid greenishyellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness and left a curious discolouration behind itas the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing it began to mumble without turning or raising its head dr armitage made no written record of its mouthings but asserts confidently that nothing in english was uttered at first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth but toward the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from thenecronomiconthat monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished these fragments as armitage recalls them ran something likengai nghaghaa buggshoggog yhah yogsothoth yogsothoth they trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipationthen came a halt in the gasping and the dog raised its head in a long lugubrious howl a change came over the yellow goatish face of the prostrate thing and the great black eyes fell in appallingly outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panicstruck whirring and fluttering against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight frantic at that which they had sought for preyall at once the dog started up abruptly gave a frightened bark and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered a cry rose from the crowd and dr armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came he was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one by this time two policemen had arrived and dr morgan meeting them in the vestibule was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stenchfilled readingroom till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered upmeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor one need not describe thekindandrateof shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of dr armitage and professor rice but it is permissible to say that aside from the external appearance of face and hands the really human element in wilbur whateley must have been very small when the medical examiner came there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared apparently whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton at least in any true or stable sense he had taken somewhat after his unknown fatherviiyet all this was only the prologue of the actual dunwich horror formalities were gone through by bewildered officials abnormal details were duly kept from press and public and men were sent to dunwich and aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late wilbur whateley they found the countryside in great agitation both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills and because of the unwonted stench and the surging lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by whateleys boardedup farmhouse earl sawyer who tended the horse and cattle during wilburs absence had developed a woefully acute case of nerves the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place and were glad to confine their survey of the deceaseds living quarters the newly mended sheds to a single visit they filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in aylesbury and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys decayed and undecayed of the upper miskatonic valleyan almost interminable manuscript in strange characters written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owners desk after a week of debate it was sent to miskatonic university together with the deceaseds collection of strange books for study and possible translation but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease no trace of the ancient gold with which wilbur and old whateley always paid their debts has yet been discoveredit was in the dark of september 9th that the horror broke loose the hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening and dogs barked frantically all night early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air about seven oclock luther brown the hired boy at george coreys between cold spring glen and the village rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to tenacre meadow with the cows he was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing

falls an bears denby that noon fully threequarters of the men and boys of dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade whateley ruins and cold spring glen examining in horror the vast monstrous prints the maimed bishop cattle the strange noisome wreck of the farmhouse and the bruised matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipicehanging underbrush it was as though a house launched by an avalanche had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope from below no sound came but only a distant undefinable foetor and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue rather than descend and beard the unknown cyclopean horror in its lair three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen someone telephoned the news to theaylesbury transcriptbut the editor accustomed to wild tales from dunwich did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it an item soon afterward reproduced by the associated pressthat night everyone went home and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible needless to say no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage about two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at elmer fryes on the eastern edge of cold spring glen and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside mrs frye proposed telephoning the neighbours and elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations it came apparently from the barn and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle the dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fearnumbed family frye lit a lantern through force of habit but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard the children and the womenfolk whimpered kept from screaming by some obscure vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence at last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning and a great snapping crashing and crackling ensued the fryes huddled together in the sittingroom did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in cold spring glen then amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen selina frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horrorthe next day all the countryside was in a panic and cowed uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the frye farmyard monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in of the cattle only a quarter could be found and identified some of these were in curious fragments and all that survived had to be shot earl sawyer suggested that help be asked from aylesbury or arkham but others maintained it would be of no use old zebulon whateley of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hilltops he came of a line where tradition ran strong and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with wilbur and his grandfatherdarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence in a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before and a futile ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about nothing however occurred except some hill noises and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come there were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majoritywhen night came again the barricading was repeated though there was less huddling together of families in the morning both the frye and the seth bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting sentinel hill as before the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions as if the moving mountain had come from cold spring glen and returned to it along the same path at the base of the hill a thirtyfoot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail whatever the horror was it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality and as the investigators climbed around to the hills summit by safer routes they saw that the trail endedor rather reversedthereit was here that the whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the tablelike stone on mayeve and hallowmass now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped men looked at one another and muttered then they looked down the hill apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent to speculate was futile reason logic and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded only old zebulon who was not with the group could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanationthursday night began much like the others but it ended less happily the whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep and about 3 am all the party telephones rang tremulously those who took down their receivers heard a frightmad voice shriek out help oh my gawd and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation there was nothing more no one dared do anything and no one knew till morning whence the call came then those who had heard it called everyone on the line and found that only the fryes did not reply the truth appeared an hour later when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the frye place at the head of the glen it was horrible yet hardly a surprise there were more swaths and monstrous prints but there was no longer any house it had caved in like an eggshell and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered only a stench and a tarry stickiness the elmer fryes had been erased from dunwichviiiin the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelflined room in arkham the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley delivered to miskatonic university for translation had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern its very alphabet notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded arabic used in mesopotamia being absolutely unknown to any available authority the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet giving the effect of a cipher though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used the ancient books taken from whateleys quarters while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science were of no assistance whatever in this matter one of them a heavy tome with an iron clasp was in another unknown alphabetthis one of a very different cast and resembling sanscrit more than anything else the old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of dr armitage both because of his peculiar interest in the whateley matter and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle agesarmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the saracenic world that question however he did not deem vital since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if as he suspected they were used as a cipher in a modern language it was his belief that considering the great amount of text involved the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in englishdr armitage knew from the repeated failures of his colleagues that the riddle was a deep and complex one and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial all through late august he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library and wading night after night amidst the arcana of trithemiuspoligraphiagiambattista portasde furtivis literarum notisde vigenrestrait des chiffresfalconerscryptomenysis patefactadavys and thicknesses eighteenthcentury treatises and such fairly modern authorities as blair von marten and klberskryptographikhe interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table and the message built up with arbitrary keywords known only to the initiated the older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones and armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters several times he seemed near daylight only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle then as september approached the clouds began to clear certain letters as used in certain parts of the manuscript emerged definitely and unmistakably and it became obvious that the text was indeed in englishon the evening of september 2nd the last major barrier gave way and dr armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of wilbur whateleys annals it was in truth a diary as all had thought and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered an entry dated november 26 1916 proved highly startling and disquieting it was written he remembered by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteentoday learned the aklo for the sabaoth it ran which did not like it being answerable from the hill and not from the air that upstairs more ahead of me than i had thought it would be and is not like to have much earth brain shot elam hutchins collie jack when he went to bite me and elam says he would kill me if he dast i guess he wont grandfather kept me saying the dho formula last night and i think i saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles i shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off if i cant break through with the dhohna formula when i commit it they from the air told me at sabbat that it will be years before i can clear off the earth and i guess grandfather will be dead then so i shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the yr and the nhhngr they from outside will help but they cannot take body without human blood that upstairs looks it will have the right cast i can see it a little when i make the voorish sign or blow the powder of ibn ghazi at it and it is near like them at mayeve on the hill the other face may wear off some i wonder how i shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it he that came with the aklo sabaoth said i may be transfigured there being much of outside to work onmorning found dr armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration he had not left the manuscript all night but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text he had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful all that day he read on now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary lunch and dinner were brought him but he ate only the smallest fraction of either toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to mans existence that he had uncoveredon the morning of september 4th professor rice and dr morgan insisted on seeing him for a while and departed trembling and ashengrey that evening he went to bed but slept only fitfully wednesdaythe next dayhe was back at the manuscript and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered in the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easychair in his office but was at the manuscript again before dawn some time before noon his physician dr hartwell called to see him and insisted that he cease work he refused intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due course of timethat evening just as twilight fell he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted his wife bringing his dinner found him in a halfcomatose state but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken weakly rising he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket he had sufficient strength to get home but was so clearly in need of medical aid that dr hartwell was summoned at once as the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over againbut what in gods name can we dodr armitage slept but was partly delirious the next day he made no explanations to hartwell but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with rice and morgan his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed including frantic appeals that something in a boardedup farmhouse be destroyed and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension he would shout that the world was in danger since the elder things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen vigintillions of aeons ago at other times he would call for the dreadednecronomiconand thedaemonolatreiaof remigius in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured upstop them stop them he would shout those whateleys meant to let them in and the worst of all is left tell rice and morgan we must do somethingits a blind business but i know how to make the powder it hasnt been fed since the second of august when wilbur came here to his death and at that rate but armitage had a sound physique despite his seventythree years and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever he woke late friday clear of head though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon rice and morgan for a conference and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance of scepticism there was none all three had seen the body of wilbur whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madmans ravingopinions were divided as to notifying the massachusetts state police and the negative finally won there were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan but all day sunday armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory the more he reflected on the hellish diary the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which wilbur whateley had left behind himthe earththreatening entity which unknown to him was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable dunwich horrormonday was a repetition of sunday with dr armitage for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain by tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out and believed he would try a trip to dunwich within a week then on wednesday the great shock came tucked obscurely away in a corner of thearkham advertiserwas a facetious little item from the associated press telling what a recordbreaking monster the bootleg whiskey of dunwich had raised up armitage half stunned could only telephone for rice and morgan far into the night they discussed and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before himixfriday morning armitage rice and morgan set out by motor for dunwich arriving at the village about one in the afternoon the day was pleasant but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep shadowy ravines of the stricken region now and then on some mountaintop a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky from the air of hushed fright at osborns store they knew something hideous had happened and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard the wounded seth bishop cattle and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance and he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summitat length the visitors apprised of a party of state police which had come from aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the frye tragedy decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable this however they found more easily planned than performed since no sign of the party could be found in any direction there had been five of them in a car but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the frye yard the natives all of whom had talked with the policemen seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions then old sam hutchins thought of something and turned pale nudging fred farr and pointing to the dank deep hollow that yawned close bygawd he gasped i telled em not ter go daown into the glen an i never thought nobodyd dew it with them tracks an that smell an the whippoorwills ascreechin daown thar in the dark o noonday a cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive unconscious listening armitage now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his night would soon fall and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch coursenegotium perambulans in tenebris the old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised he saw that his electric flashlight was in working order rice beside him took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects whilst morgan uncased the biggame rifle on which he relied despite his colleagues warnings that no material weapon would be of helparmitage having read the hideous diary knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect but he did not add to the fright of the dunwich people by giving any hints or clues he hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped as the shadows gathered the natives commenced to disperse homeward anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose they shook their heads at the visitors plan to stand guard at the frye ruins near the glen and as they left had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers againthere were rumblings under the hills that night and the whippoorwills piped threateningly once in a while a wind sweeping up out of cold spring glen would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being but the lookedfor terror did not appear whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time and armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the darkmorning came wanly and the nightsounds ceased it was a grey bleak day with now and then a drizzle of rain and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest the men from arkham were undecided what to do seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings they debated the wisdom of waiting or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless monstrous quarry the downpour waxed in heaviness and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons sheet lightning shimmered and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand as if descending into the accursed glen itself the sky grew very dark and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short sharp one followed by clear weatherit was still gruesomely dark when not much over an hour later a confused babel of voices sounded down the road another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men running shouting and even whimpering hysterically someone in the lead began sobbing out words and the arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent formoh my gawd my gawd the voice choked out its agoin aginan this time by dayits aoutits aout an amovin this very minute an only the lord knows when itll be on us allthe speaker panted into silence but another took up his messagenigh on a haour ago zeb whateley here heerd the phone aringin an it was mis corey

think its the lords jedgment fer our iniquities that no mortal kin ever set asidearmitage saw that the time for positive action had come and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rusticswe must follow it boys he made his voice as reassuring as possible i believe theres a chance of putting it out of business you men know that those whateleys were wizardswell this thing is a thing of wizardry and must be put down by the same means ive seen wilbur whateleys diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away of course one cant be sure but we can always take a chance its invisiblei knew it would bebut theres a powder in this longdistance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second later on well try it its a frightful thing to have alive but it isnt as bad as what wilbur would have let in if hed lived longer youll never know what the world has escaped now weve only this one thing to fight and it cant multiply it can though do a lot of harm so we mustnt hesitate to rid the community of itwe must follow itand the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked let somebody lead the wayi dont know your roads very well but ive an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots how about itthe men shuffled about a moment and then earl sawyer spoke softly pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening raini guess ye kin git to seth bishops quickest by cuttin acrost the lower medder here wadin the brook at the low place an climbin through carriers mowin and the timberlot beyont that comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh sethsa leetle tother sidearmitage with rice and morgan started to walk in the direction indicated and most of the natives followed slowly the sky was growing lighter and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away when armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction joe osborn warned him and walked ahead to shew the right one courage and confidence were mounting though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder put these qualities to a severe testat length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out they were a little beyond the seth bishop place but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had passed by only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend it was the frye incident all over again and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the bishop house and barn no one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked whateley farmhouse and the altarcrowned slopes of sentinel hillas the men passed the site of wilbur whateleys abode they shuddered visibly and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal it was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon opposite the base of sentinel hill the tracks left the road and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monsters former route to and from the summitarmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill then he handed the instrument to morgan whose sight was keener after a moment of gazing morgan cried out sharply passing the glass to earl sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger sawyer as clumsy as most nonusers of optical devices are fumbled a while but eventually focussed the lenses with armitages aid when he did so his cry was less restrained than morgans had beengawd almighty the grass an bushes is amovin its agoin upslowlikecreepin up ter the top this minute heaven only knows what furthen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers it was one thing to chase the nameless entity but quite another to find it spells might be all rightbut suppose they werent voices began questioning armitage about what he knew of the thing and no reply seemed quite to satisfy everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane experience of mankindxin the end the three men from arkhamold whitebearded dr armitage stocky irongrey professor rice and lean youngish dr morganascended the mountain alone after much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around it was hard going and armitage had to be helped more than once high above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed with snaillike deliberateness then it was obvious that the pursuers were gainingcurtis whateleyof the undecayed branchwas holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath he told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending this indeed proved to be true and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed itthen wesley corey who had taken the glass cried out that armitage was adjusting the sprayer which rice held and that something must be about to happen the crowd stirred uneasily recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility two or three men shut their eyes but curtis whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost he saw that rice from the partys point of vantage above and behind the entity had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effectthose without the telescope saw only an instants flash of grey clouda cloud about the size of a moderately large buildingnear the top of the mountain curtis who had held the instrument dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankledeep mud of the road he reeled and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him all he could do was moan halfinaudiblyoh oh great gawd that that there was a pandemonium of questioning and only henry wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud curtis was past all coherence and even isolated replies were almost too much for himbiggern a barn all made o squirmin ropes hull thing sort o shaped like a hens egg biggern anything with dozens o legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step nothin solid abaout itall like jelly an made o seprit wrigglin ropes pushed clost together great bulgin eyes all over it ten or twenty maouths or

whatever it was proved too much for poor curtis and he collapsed completely before he could say more fred farr and will hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass henry wheeler trembling turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed only thesenothing more then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind and even in the underbrush of sentinel hill itself it was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancyearl sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge virtually level with the altarstone but at a considerable distance from it one figure he said seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals and as sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint halfmusical sound from the distance as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures the weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation i guess hes sayin the spell whispered wheeler as he snatched back the telescope the whippoorwills were piping wildly and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritualsuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud it was a very peculiar phenomenon and was plainly marked by all a rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky lightning flashed aloft and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm the chanting of the men from arkham now became unmistakable and wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogsthe change in the quality of the daylight increased and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder a purplish darkness born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the skys blue pressed down upon the rumbling hills then the lightning flashed again somewhat brighter than before and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altarstone on the distant height no one however had been using the telescope at that instant the whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation and the men of dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surchargedwithout warning came those deep cracked raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them not from any human throat were they born for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions rather would one have said they came from the pit itself had not their source been so unmistakably the altarstone on the peak it is almost erroneous to call themsoundsat all since so much of their ghastly infrabass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear yet one must do so since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of halfarticulatewordsthey were loudloud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoedyet did they come from no visible being and because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of nonvisible beings the huddled crowd at the mountains base huddled still closer and winced as if in expectation of a blowygnaiih ygnaiih thflthkhngha yogsothoth rang the hideous croaking out of spaceybthnk hehyengrkdllh the speaking impulse seemed to falter here as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on henry wheeler strained his eye at the telescope but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination from what black wells of acherontic fear or feeling from what unplumbed gulfs of extracosmic consciousness or obscure longlatent heredity were those halfarticulate thundercroakings drawn presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark utter ultimate frenzyehyayayayahaaheyayayayaaaa nghaaaaa nghaaaa hyuh hyuh help help fffffffather father yogsothoth but that was all the pallid group in the road still reeling at theindisputably englishsyllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altarstone were never to hear such syllables again instead they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills the deafening cataclysmic peal whose source be it inner earth or sky no hearer was ever able to place a single lightningbolt shot from the purple zenith to the altarstone and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside trees grass and underbrush were whipped into a fury and the frightened crowd at the mountains base weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them were almost hurled off their feet dogs howled from the distance green grass and foliage wilted to a curious sickly yellowgrey and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwillsthe stench left quickly but the vegetation never came right again to this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted they were grave and quiet and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering in reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital factthe thing has gone forever armitage said it has been split up into what it was originally made of and can never exist again it was an impossibility in a normal world only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know it was like its fatherand most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hillsthere was a brief silence and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity so that he put his hands to his head with a moan memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him againoh oh my gawd that haff facethat haff face on top of it that face with the red eyes an crinkly albino hair an no chin like the whateleys it was a octopus centipede spider kind o thing but they was a haffshaped mans face on top of it an it looked like wizard whateleys only it was yards an yards acrost he paused exhausted as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror only old zebulon whateley who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore spoke aloudfifteen year gone he rambled i heerd ol whateley say as haow some day wed hear a child o lavinnys acallin its fathers name on the top o sentinel hill but joe osborn interrupted him to question the arkham men anewwhat was it anyhaowan haowever did young wizard whateley call it aout o the air it come fromarmitage chose his words very carefullyit waswell it was mostly a kind of force that doesnt belong in our part of space a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature we have no business calling in such things from outside and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to there was some of it in wilbur whateley himselfenough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight im going to burn his accursed diary and if you men are wise youll dynamite that altarstone up there and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills things like that brought down the beings those whateleys were so fond ofthe beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purposebut as to this thing weve just sent backthe whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come it grew fast and big from the same reason that wilbur grew fast and bigbut it beat him because it had a greater share of theoutsidenessin it you neednt ask how wilbur called it out of the air he didnt call it outit was his twin brother but it looked more like the father than he did,1
for one who has never faced the danger of legal execution i have a rather queer horror of the electric chair as a subject indeed i think the topic gives me more of a shudder than it gives many a man who has been on trial for his life the reason is that i associate the thing with an incident of forty years agoa very strange incident which brought me close to the edge of the unknowns black abyssin 1889 i was an auditor and investigator connected with the tlaxcala mining company of san francisco which operated several small silver and copper properties in the san mateo mountains in mexico there had been some trouble at mine no 3 which had a surly furtive assistant superintendent named arthur feldon and on august 6th the firm received a telegram saying that feldon had decamped taking with him all the stock records securities and private papers and leaving the whole clerical and financial situation in dire confusionthis development was a severe blow to the company and late in the afternoon president mccomb called me into his office to give orders for the recovery of the papers at any cost there were he knew grave drawbacks i had never seen feldon and there were only very indifferent photographs to go by moreover my own wedding was set for thursday of the following weekonly nine days aheadso that i was naturally not eager to be hurried off to mexico on a manhunt of indefinite length the need however was so great that mccomb felt justified in asking me to go at once and i for my part decided that the effect on my status with the company would make ready acquiescence eminently worth whilei was to start that night using the presidents private car as far as mexico city after which i would have to take a narrowgauge railway to the mines jackson the superintendent of no 3 would give me all details and any possible clues upon my arrival and then the search would begin in earnestthrough the mountains down to the coast or among the byways of mexico city as the case might be i set out with a grim determination to get the matter doneand successfully doneas swiftly as possible and tempered my discontent with pictures of an early return with papers and culprit and of a wedding which would be almost a triumphal ceremonyhaving notified my family fiance and principal friends and made hasty preparations for the trip i met president mccomb at eight pm at the southern pacific depot received from him some written instructions and a checkbook and left in his car attached to the 815 eastbound transcontinental train the journey that followed seemed destined for uneventfulness and after a good nights sleep i revelled in the ease of the private car so thoughtfully assigned me reading my instructions with care and formulating plans for the capture of feldon and the recovery of the documents i knew the tlaxcala country quite wellprobably much better than the missing manhence had a certain amount of advantage in my search unless he had already used the railwayaccording to the instructions feldon had been a subject of worry to superintendent jackson for some time acting secretively and working unaccountably in the companys laboratory at odd hours that he was implicated with a mexican boss and several peons in some thefts of ore was strongly suspected but though the natives had been discharged there was not enough evidence to warrant any positive step regarding the subtle official indeed despite his furtiveness there seemed to be more of defiance than of guilt in the mans bearing he wore a chip on his shoulder and talked as if the company were cheating him instead of his cheating the company the obvious surveillance of his colleagues jackson wrote appeared to irritate him increasingly and now he had gone with everything of importance in the office of his possible whereabouts no guess could be made though jacksons final telegram suggested the wild slopes of the sierra de malinche that tall mythsurrounded peak with the corpseshaped silhouette from whose neighbourhood the thieving natives were said to have comeat el paso which we reached at two am of the night following our start my private car was detached from the transcontinental train and joined to an engine specially ordered by telegraph to take it southward to mexico city i continued to drowse till dawn and all the next day grew bored on the flat desert chihuahua landscape the crew had told me we were due in mexico city at noon friday but i soon saw that countless delays were wasting precious hours there were waits on sidings all along the singletracked route and now and then a hotbox or other difficulty would further complicate the scheduleat torren we were six hours late and it was almost eight oclock on friday eveningfully twelve hours behind schedulewhen the conductor consented to do some speeding in an effort to make up time my nerves were on edge and i could do nothing but pace the car in desperation in the end i found that the speeding had been purchased at a high cost indeed for within a halfhour the symptoms of a hotbox had developed in my car itself so that after a maddening wait the crew decided that all the bearings would have to be overhauled after a quarterspeed limp ahead to the next station with shopsthe factory town of quertaro this was the last straw and i almost stamped like a child actually i sometimes caught myself pushing at my chairarm as if trying to urge the train forward at a less snaillike paceit was almost ten in the evening when we drew into quertaro and i spent a fretful hour on the station platform while my car was sidetracked and tinkered at by a dozen native mechanics at last they told me the job was too much for them since the forward truck needed new parts which could not be obtained nearer than mexico city everything indeed seemed against me and i gritted my teeth when i thought of feldon getting farther and farther awayperhaps to the easy cover of vera cruz with its shipping or mexico city with its varied rail facilitieswhile fresh delays kept me tied and helpless of course jackson had notified the police in all the cities around but i knew with sorrow what their efficiency amounted tothe best i could do i soon found out was to take the regular night express for mexico city which ran from aguas calientes and made a fiveminute stop at quertaro it would be along at one am if on time and was due in mexico city at five oclock saturday morning when i purchased my ticket i found that the train would be made up of european compartment carriages instead of long american cars with rows of twoseat chairs these had been much used in the early days of mexican railroading owing to the european construction interests back of the first lines and in 1889 the mexican central was still running a fair number of them on its shorter trips ordinarily i prefer the american coaches since i hate to have people facing me but for this once i was glad of the foreign carriage at such a time of night i stood a good chance of having a whole compartment to myself and in my tired nervously hypersensitive state i welcomed the solitudeas well as the comfortably upholstered seat with soft armrests and headcushion running the whole width of the vehicle i bought a firstclass ticket obtained my valise from the sidetracked private car telegraphed both president mccomb and jackson of what had happened and settled down in the station to wait for the night express as patiently as my strained nerves would let mefor a wonder the train was only half an hour late though even so the solitary station vigil had about finished my endurance the conductor shewing me into a compartment told me he expected to make up the delay and reach the capital on time and i stretched myself comfortably on the forwardfacing seat in the expectation of a quiet threeandahalfhour run the light from the overhead oil lamp was soothingly dim and i wondered whether i could snatch some muchneeded sleep in spite of my anxiety and nervetension it seemed as the train jolted into motion that i was alone and i was heartily glad of it my thoughts leaped ahead to my quest and i nodded with the accelerating rhythm of the speeding string of carriagesthen suddenly i perceived that i was not alone after all in the corner diagonally opposite me slumped down so that his face was invisible sat a roughly clad man of unusual size whom the feeble light had failed to reveal before beside him on the seat was a huge valise battered and bulging and tightly gripped even in his sleep by one of his incongruously slender hands as the engine whistled sharply at some curve or crossing the sleeper started nervously into a kind of watchful halfawakening raising his head and disclosing a handsome face bearded and clearly anglosaxon with dark lustrous eyes at sight of me his wakefulness became complete and i wondered at the rather hostile wildness of his glance no doubt i thought he resented my presence when he had hoped to have the compartment alone all the way just as i was myself disappointed to find strange company in the halflighted carriage the best we could do however was to accept the situation gracefully so i began apologising to the man for my intrusion he seemed to be a fellowamerican and we could both feel more at ease after a few civilities then we could leave each other in peace for the balance of the journeyto my surprise the stranger did not respond to my courtesies with so much as a word instead he kept staring at me fiercely and almost appraisingly and brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a cigar with a nervous lateral movement of his disengaged hand his other hand still tensely clutched the great worn valise and his whole person seemed to radiate some obscure malignity after a time he abruptly turned his face toward the window though there was nothing to see in the dense blackness outside oddly he appeared to be looking at something as intently as if there really were something to look at i decided to leave him to his own curious devices and meditations without further annoyance so settled back in my seat drew the brim of my soft hat over my face and closed my eyes in an effort to snatch the sleep i had half counted oni could not have dozed very long or very fully when my eyes fell open as if in response to some external force closing them again with some determination i renewed my quest of a nap yet wholly without avail an intangible influence seemed bent on keeping me awake so raising my head i looked about the dimly lighted compartment to see if anything were amiss all appeared normal but i noticed that the stranger in the opposite corner was looking at me very intentlyintently though without any of the geniality or friendliness which would have implied a change from his former surly attitude i did not attempt conversation this time but leaned back in my previous sleepy posture half closing my eyes as if i had dozed off once more yet continuing to watch him curiously from beneath my downturned hat brimas the train rattled onward through the night i saw a subtle and gradual metamorphosis come over the expression of the staring man evidently satisfied that i was asleep he allowed his face to reflect a curious jumble of emotions the nature of which seemed anything but reassuring hatred fear triumph and fanaticism flickered compositely over the lines of his lips and the angles of his eyes while his gaze became a glare of really alarming greed and ferocity suddenly it dawned upon me that this man was mad and dangerously soi will not pretend that i was anything but deeply and thoroughly frightened when i saw how things stood perspiration started out all over me and i had hard work to maintain my attitude of relaxation and slumber life had many attractions for me just then and the thought of dealing with a homicidal maniacpossibly armed and certainly powerful to a marvellous degreewas a dismaying and terrifying one my disadvantage in any sort of struggle was enormous for the man was a virtual giant evidently in the best of athletic trim while i have always been rather frail and was then almost worn out with anxiety sleeplessness and nervous tension it was undeniably a bad moment for me and i felt pretty close to a horrible death as i recognised the fury of madness in the strangers eyes events from the past came up into my consciousness as if for a farewelljust as a drowning mans whole life is said to resurrect itself before him at the last momentof course i had my revolver in my coat pocket but any motion of mine to reach and draw it would be instantly obvious moreover if i did secure it there was no telling what effect it would have on the maniac even if i shot him once or twice he might have enough remaining strength to get the gun from me and deal with me in his own way or if he were armed himself he might shoot or stab without trying to disarm me one can cow a sane man by covering him with a pistol but an insane mans complete indifference to consequences gives him a strength and menace quite superhuman for the time being even in those prefreudian days i had a commonsense realisation of the dangerous power of a person without normal inhibitions that the stranger in the corner was indeed about to start some murderous action his burning eyes and twitching facial muscles did not permit me to doubt for a momentsuddenly i heard his breath begin to come in excited gasps and saw his chest heaving with mounting excitement the time for a showdown was close and i tried desperately to think of the best thing to do without interrupting my pretence of sleep i began to slide my right hand gradually and inconspicuously toward the pocket containing my pistol watching the madman closely as i did so to see if he would detect any move unfortunately he didalmost before he had time to register the fact in his expression with a bound so agile and abrupt as to be almost incredible in a man of his size he was upon me before i knew what had happened looming up and swaying forward like a giant ogre of legend and pinioning me with one powerful hand while with the other he forestalled me in reaching the revolver taking it from my pocket and placing it in his own he released me contemptuously well knowing how fully his physique placed me at his mercy then he stood up at his full heighthis head almost touching the roof of the carriageand stared down at me with eyes whose fury had quickly turned to a look of pitying scorn and ghoulish calculationi did not move and after a moment the man resumed his seat opposite me smiling a ghastly smile as he opened his great bulging valise and extracted an article of peculiar appearancea rather large cage of semiflexible wire woven somewhat like a baseball catchers mask but shaped more like the helmet of a divingsuit its top was connected with a cord whose other end remained in the valise this device he fondled with obvious affection cradling it in his lap as he looked at me afresh and licked his bearded lips with an almost feline motion of the tongue then for the first time he spokein a deep mellow voice of softness and cultivation startlingly at variance with his rough corduroy clothes and unkempt aspectyou are fortunate sir i shall use you first of all you shall go into history as the first fruits of a remarkable invention vast sociological consequencesi shall let my light shine as it were im radiating all the time but nobody knows it now you shall know intelligent guineapig cats and burrosit worked even with a burro he paused while his bearded features underwent a convulsive motion closely synchronised with a vigorous gyratory shaking of the whole head it was as though he were shaking clear of some nebulous obstructing medium for the gesture was followed by a clarification or subtilisation of expression which hid the more obvious madness in a look of suave composure through which the craftiness gleamed only dimly i glimpsed the difference at once and put in a word to see if i could lead his mind into harmless channelsyou seem to have a marvellously fine instrument if im any judge wont you tell me how you came to invent ithe noddedmere logical reflection dear sir i consulted the needs of the age and acted upon them others might have done the same had their minds been as powerfulthat is as capable of sustained concentrationas mine i had the sense of convictionthe available will powerthat is all i realised as no one else has yet realised how imperative it is to remove everybody from the earth before quetzalcoatl comes back and realised also that it must be done elegantly i hate butchery of any kind and hanging is barbarously crude you know last year the new york legislature voted to adopt electric execution for condemned menbut all the apparatus they have in mind is as primitive as stephensons rocket or davenports first electric engine i knew of a better way and told them so but they paid no attention to me god the fools as if i didnt know all there is to know about men and death and electricitystudent man and boytechnologist and engineersoldier of fortune he leaned back and narrowed his eyesi was in maximilians army twenty years and more ago they were going to make me a nobleman then those damned greasers killed him and i had to go home but i came backback and forth back and forth i live in rochester ny his eyes grew deeply crafty and he leaned forward touching me on the knee with the fingers of a paradoxically delicate handi came back i say and i went deeper than any of them i hate greasers but i like mexicans a puzzle listen to me young fellowyou dont think mexico is really spanish do you god if you knew

conversational toneit would surprise you to know what things are told in the mountains huitzilopotchli is coming back of that there can be no doubt any peon south of mexico city can tell you that but i meant to do nothing about it i went home as i tell you again and again and was going to benefit society with my electric executioner when that cursed albany legislature adopted the other way a joke

you carebut youll soon knowwhy damn you all the good there ever will be in that electric chair will have been stolen from me the ghost of nezahualpilli told me that on the sacred mountain they watched

needs is testing that is ithere the wire hood or headnet is flexible and slips on easily neckpiece binds but doesnt choke electrodes touch forehead and base of cerebellumall thats necessary stop the head and what else can go the fools up at albany with their carved oak easychair think theyve got to make it a headtofoot affair idiotsdont they know that you dont need to shoot a man through the body

hearingnobody knowsi alone have the secretthats why i and quetzalcoatl and huitzilopotchli will rule the world alonei and they if i choose to let them but i must have experimental subjectssubjectsdo you know whom ive chosen for the firsti tried jocoseness quickly merging into friendly seriousness as a sedative quick thought and apt words might save me yetwell there are lots of fine subjects among the politicians of san francisco where i come from they need your treatment and id like to help you introduce it but really i think i can help you in all truth i have some influence in sacramento and if youll go back to the states with me after im through with my business in mexico ill see that you get a hearinghe answered soberly and civillynoi cant go back i swore not to when those criminals at albany turned down my invention and set spies to watch me and steal from me but i must have american subjects those greasers are under a curse and would be too easy and the fullblood indiansthe real children of the feathered serpentare sacred and inviolate except for proper sacrificial victims and even those must be slain according to ceremony i must have americans without going backand the first man i choose will be signally honoured do you know who he isi temporised desperatelyoh if thats all the trouble ill find you a dozen firstrate yankee specimens as soon as we get to mexico city i know where there are lots of small mining men who wouldnt be missed for daysbut he cut me short with a new and sudden air of authority which had a touch of real dignity in itthatll doweve trifled long enough get up and stand erect like a man youre the subject ive chosen and youll thank me for the honour in the other world just as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest for transferring him to eternal glory a new principleno other man alive has dreamed of such a battery and it might never again be hit on if the world experimented a thousand years do you know that atoms arent what they seem fools a century after this some dolt would be guessing if i were to let the world liveas i arose at his command he drew additional feet of cord from the valise and stood erect beside me the wire helmet outstretched toward me in both hands and a look of real exaltation on his tanned and bearded face for an instant he seemed like a radiant hellenic mystagogue or hierophanthere o youtha libation wine of the cosmosnectar of the starry spaceslinosiacchusialmenoszagreusdionysosatyshylassprung from apollo and slain by the hounds of argosseed of psamathechild of the sunevo evohe was chanting again and this time his mind seemed far back amongst the classic memories of his college days in my erect posture i noticed the nearness of the signal cord overhead and wondered whether i could reach it through some gesture of ostensible response to his ceremonial mood it was worth trying so with an antiphonal cry of evo i put my arms forward and upward toward him in a ritualistic fashion hoping to give the cord a tug before he could notice the act but it was useless he saw my purpose and moved one hand toward the righthand coat pocket where my revolver lay no words were needed and we stood for a moment like carven figures then he quietly said make hasteagain my mind rushed frantically about seeking avenues of escape the doors i knew were not locked on mexican trains but my companion could easily forestall me if i tried to unlatch one and jump out besides our speed was so great that success in that direction would probably be as fatal as failure the only thing to do was to play for time of the threeandahalfhour trip a good slice was already worn away and once we got to mexico city the guards and police in the station would provide instant safetythere would i thought be two distinct times for diplomatic stalling if i could get him to postpone the slipping on of the hood that much time would be gained of course i had no belief that the thing was really deadly but i knew enough of madmen to understand what would happen when it failed to work to his disappointment would be added a mad sense of my responsibility for the failure and the result would be a red chaos of murderous rage therefore the experiment must be postponed as long as possible yet the second opportunity did exist for if i planned cleverly i might devise explanations for the failure which would hold his attention and lead him into more or less extended searches for corrective influences i wondered just how far his credulity went and whether i could prepare in advance a prophecy of failure which would make the failure itself stamp me as a seer or initiate or perhaps a god i had enough of a smattering of mexican mythology to make it worth trying though i would try other delaying influences first and let the prophecy come as a sudden revelation would he spare me in the end if i could make him think me a prophet or divinity could i get by as quetzalcoatl or huitzilopotchli anything to drag matters out till five oclock when we were due in mexico citybut my opening stall was the veteran willmaking ruse as the maniac repeated his command for haste i told him of my family and intended marriage and asked for the privilege of leaving a message and disposing of my money and effects if i said he would lend me some paper and agree to mail what i should write i could die more peacefully and willingly after some cogitation he gave a favourable verdict and fished in his valise for a pad which he handed me solemnly as i resumed my seat i produced a pencil artfully breaking the point at the outset and causing some delay while he searched for one of his own when he gave me this he took my broken pencil and proceeded to sharpen it with a large hornhandled knife which had been in his belt under his coat evidently a second pencilbreaking would not profit me greatlywhat i wrote i can hardly recall at this date it was largely gibberish and composed of random scraps of memorised literature when i could think of nothing else to set down i made my handwriting as illegible as i could without destroying its nature as writing for i knew he would be likely to look at the result before commencing his experiment and realised how he would react to the sight of obvious nonsense the ordeal was a terrible one and i chafed each second at the slowness of the train in the past i had often whistled a brisk gallop to the sprightly tac of wheels on rails but now the tempo seemed slowed down to that of a funeral marchmy funeral march i grimly reflectedmy ruse worked till i had covered over four pages six by nine when at last the madman drew out his watch and told me i could have but five minutes more what should i do next i was hastily going through the form of concluding the will when a new idea struck me ending with a flourish and handing him the finished sheets which he thrust carelessly into his lefthand coat pocket i reminded him of my influential sacramento friends who would be so much interested in his inventionoughtnt i to give you a letter of introduction to them i said oughtnt i to make a signed sketch and description of your executioner so that theyll grant you a cordial hearing they can make you famous you knowand theres no question at all but that theyll adopt your method for the state of california if they hear of it through someone like me whom they know and trusti was taking this tack on the chance that his thoughts as a disappointed inventor would let him forget the aztecreligious side of his mania for a while when he veered to the latter again i reflected i would spring the revelation and prophecy the scheme worked for his eyes glowed an eager assent though he brusquely told me to be quick he further emptied the valise lifting out a queerlooking congeries of glass cells and coils to which the wire from the helmet was attached and delivering a fire of running comment too technical for me to follow yet apparently quite plausible and straightforward i pretended to note down all he said wondering as i did so whether the queer apparatus was really a battery after all would i get a slight shock when he applied the device the man surely talked as if he were a genuine electrician description of his own invention was clearly a congenial task for him and i saw he was not as impatient as before the hopeful grey of dawn glimmered red through the windows before he wound up and i felt at last that my chance of escape had really become tangiblebut he too saw the dawn and began glaring wildly again he knew the train was due in mexico city at five and would certainly force quick action unless i could override all his judgment with engrossing ideas as he rose with a determined air setting the battery on the seat beside the open valise i reminded him that i had not made the needed sketch and asked him to hold the headpiece so that i could draw it near the battery he complied and resumed his seat with many admonitions to me to hurry after another moment i paused for some information asking him how the victim was placed for execution and how his presumable struggles were overcomewhy he replied the criminal is securely strapped to a post it does not matter how much he tosses his head for the helmet fits tightly and draws even closer when the current comes on we turn the switch graduallyyou see it here a carefully arranged affair with a rheostata new idea for delay occurred to me as the tilled fields and increasingly frequent houses in the dawnlight outside told of our approach to the capital at lastbut i said i must draw the helmet in place on a human head as well as beside the battery cant you slip it on yourself a moment so that i can sketch you with it the papers as well as the officials will want all this and they are strong on completenessi had by chance made a better shot than i had planned for at my mention of the press the madmans eyes lit up afreshthe papers yesdamn them you can make even the papers give me a hearing they all laughed at me and wouldnt print a word here you hurry up weve not a second to losehe had slipped the headpiece on and was watching my flying pencil avidly the wire mesh gave him a grotesque comic look as he sat there with nervously twitching handsnow curse em theyll print pictures ill revise your sketch if you make any blundersmust be accurate at any cost police will find you afterwardtheyll tell how it works associated press itemback up your letterimmortal fame hurry i sayhurry confound youthe train was lurching over the poorer roadbed near the city and we swayed disconcertingly now and then with this excuse i managed to break the pencil again but of course the maniac at once handed me my own which he had sharpened my first batch of ruses was about used up and i felt that i should have to submit to the headpiece in a moment we were still a good quarterhour from the terminal and it was about time for me to divert my companion to his religious side and spring the divine prophecymustering up my scraps of nahuanaztec mythology i suddenly threw down pencil and paper and commenced to chanti i tloquenahuaque thou who art all in thyself thou too ipalnemoan by whom we live i hear i hear i see i see serpentbearing eagle hail a message a message huitzilopotchli in my soul echoes thy thunderat my intonations the maniac stared incredulously through his odd mask his handsome face shewn in a surprise and perplexity which quickly changed to alarm his mind seemed to go blank a moment and then to recrystallise in another pattern raising his hands aloft he chanted as if in a dreammictlanteuctli great lord a sign a sign from within thy black cave i tonatiuhmetztli cthulhutl command and i servenow in all this responsive gibberish there was one word which struck an odd chord in my memory odd because it never occurs in any printed account of mexican mythology yet had been overheard by me more than once as an awestruck whisper amongst the peons in my own firms tlaxcala mines it seemed to be part of an exceedingly secret and ancient ritual for there were characteristic whispered responses which i had caught now and then and which were as unknown as itself to academic scholarship this maniac must have spent considerable time with the hill peons and indians just as he had said for surely such unrecorded lore could have come from no mere booklearning realising the importance he must attach to this doubly esoteric jargon i determined to strike at his most vulnerable spot and give him the gibberish responses the natives usedyarlyeh yarlyeh i shouted cthulhutl fhtaghn niguratlyig yogsototlbut i never had a chance to finish galvanised into a religious epilepsy by the exact response which his subconscious mind had probably not really expected the madman scrambled down to a kneeling posture on the floor bowing his wirehelmeted head again and again and turning it to the right and left as he did so with each turn his obeisances became more profound and i could hear his foaming lips repeating the syllable kill kill kill in a rapidly swelling monotone it occurred to me that i had overreached myself and that my response had unloosed a mounting mania which would rouse him to the slayingpoint before the train reached the stationas the arc of the madmans turnings gradually increased the slack in the cord from his headpiece to the battery had naturally been taken up more and more now in an allforgetting delirium of ecstasy he began to magnify his turns to complete circles so that the cord wound round his neck and began to tug at its moorings to the battery on the seat i wondered what he would do when the inevitable would happen and the battery would be dragged to presumable destruction on the floorthen came the sudden cataclysm the battery yanked over the seats edge by the maniacs last gesture of orgiastic frenzy did indeed fall but it did not seem to have wholly broken instead as my eye caught the spectacle in one toofleeting instant the actual impact was borne by the rheostat so that the switch was jerked over instantly to full current and the marvellous thing is that therewasa current the invention was no mere dream of insanityi saw a blinding blue auroral coruscation heard an ululating shriek more hideous than any of the previous cries of that mad horrible journey and smelled the nauseous odour of burning flesh that was all my overwrought consciousness could bear and i sank instantly into oblivionwhen the train guard at mexico city revived me i found a crowd on the station platform around my compartment door at my involuntary cry the pressing faces became curious and dubious and i was glad when the guard shut out all but the trim doctor who had pushed his way through to me my cry was a very natural thing but it had been prompted by something more than the shocking sight on the carriage floor which i had expected to see or should say by somethinglessbecause in truth there was not anything on the floor at allnor said the guard had there been when he opened the door and found me unconscious within my ticket was the only one sold for that compartment and i was the only person found within it just myself and my valise nothing more i had been alone all the way from quertaro guard doctor and spectators alike tapped their foreheads significantly at my frantic and insistent questionshad it all been a dream or was i indeed mad i recalled my anxiety and overwrought nerves and shuddered thanking the guard and doctor and shaking free of the curious crowd i staggered into a cab and was taken to the fonda nacional where after telegraphing jackson at the mine i slept till afternoon in an effort to get a fresh grip on myself i had myself called at one oclock in time to catch the narrowgauge for the mining country but when i got up i found a telegram under the door it was from jackson and said that feldon had been found dead in the mountains that morning the news reaching the mine about ten oclock the papers were all safe and the san francisco office had been duly notified so the whole trip with its nervous haste and harrowing mental ordeal had been for nothingknowing that mccomb would expect a personal report despite the course of events i sent another wire ahead and took the narrowgauge after all four hours later i was rattled and jolted into the station of mine no 3 where jackson was waiting to give a cordial greeting he was so full of the affair at the mine that he did not notice my still shaken and seedy appearancethe superintendents story was brief and he told me it as he led me toward the shack up the hillside above thearrastrewhere feldons body lay feldon he said had always been a queer sullen character ever since he was hired the year before working at some secret mechanical device and complaining of constant espionage and being disgustingly familiar with the native workmen but he certainly knew the work the country and the people he used to make long trips into the hills where the peons lived and even to take part in some of their ancient heathenish ceremonies he hinted at odd secrets and strange powers as often as he boasted of his mechanical skill of late he had disintegrated rapidly growing morbidly suspicious of his colleagues and undoubtedly joining his native friends in orethieving after his cash got low he needed unholy amounts of money for something or otherwas always having boxes come from laboratories and machine shops in mexico city or the statesas for the final absconding with all the papersit was only a crazy gesture of revenge for what he called spying he was certainly stark mad for he had gone across country to a hidden cave on the wild slope of the haunted sierra de malinche where no white men live and had done some amazingly queer things the cave which would never have been found but for the final tragedy was full of hideous old aztec idols and altars the latter covered with the charred bones of recent burntofferings of doubtful nature the natives would tell nothingindeed they swore they knew nothingbut it was easy to see that the cave was an old rendezvous of theirs and that feldon had shared their practices to the fullest extentthe searchers had found the place only because of the chanting and the final cry it had been close to five that morning and after an allnight encampment the party had begun to pack up for its emptyhanded return to the mines then somebody had heard faint rhythms in the distance and knew that one of the noxious old native rituals was being howled from some lonely spot up the slope of the corpseshaped mountain they heard the same old namesmictlanteuctli tonatiuhmetzli cthulhutl yarlyeh and all the restbut the queer thing was that some english words were mixed with them real white mans english and no greaser patter guided by the sound they had hastened up the weedentangled mountainside toward it when after a spell of quiet the shriek had burst upon them it was a terrible thinga worse thing than any of them had ever heard before there seemed to be some smoke too and a morbid acrid smellthen they stumbled on the cave its entrance screened by scrub mesquites but now emitting clouds of foetid smoke it was lighted within the horrible altars and grotesque images revealed flickeringly by candles which must have been changed less than a halfhour before and on the gravelly floor lay the horror that made all the crowd reel backward it was feldon head burned to a crisp by some odd device he had slipped over ita kind of wire cage connected with a rather shakenup battery which had evidently fallen to the floor from a nearby altarpot when the men saw it they exchanged glances thinking of the electric executioner feldon had always boasted of inventingthe thing which everyone had rejected but had tried to steal and copy the papers were safe in feldons open portmanteau which stood close by and an hour later the column of searchers started back for no 3 with a grisly burden on an improvised stretcherthat was all but it was enough to make me turn pale and falter as jackson led me up past thearrastreto the shed where he said the body lay for i was not without imagination and knew only too well into what hellish nightmare this tragedy somehow supernaturally dovetailed i knew what i should see inside that gaping door around which the curious miners clustered and did not flinch when my eyes took in the giant form the rough corduroy clothes the oddly delicate hands the wisps of burnt beard and the hellish machine itselfbattery slightly broken and headpiece blackened by the charring of what was inside the great bulging portmanteau did not surprise me and i quailed only at two thingsthe folded sheets of paper sticking out of the lefthand pocket and the queer sagging of the corresponding righthand pocket in a moment when no one was looking i reached out and seized the too familiar sheets crushing them in my hand without daring to look at their penmanship i ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic fear made me burn them that night with averted eyes they would have been a positive proof or disproof of somethingbut for that matter i could still have had proof by asking about the revolver the coroner afterward took from that sagging righthand coat pocket i never had the courage to ask about thatbecause my own revolver was missing after the night on the train my pocket pencil too shewed signs of a crude and hasty sharpening unlike the precise pointing i had given it friday afternoon on the machine in president mccombs private carso in the end i went home still puzzledmercifully puzzled perhaps the private car was repaired when i got back to quertaro but my greatest relief was crossing the rio grande into el paso and the states by the next friday i was in san francisco again and the postponed wedding came off the following weekas to what really happened that nightas ive said i simply dont dare to speculate that chap feldon was insane to start with and on top of his insanity he had piled a lot of prehistoric aztec witchlore that nobody has any right to know he was really an inventive genius and that battery must have been the genuine stuff i heard later how he had been brushed aside in former years by press public and potentates alike too much disappointment isnt good for men of a certain kind anyhow some unholy combination of influences was at work he had really by the way been a soldier of maximilianswhen i tell my story most people call me a plain liar others lay it to abnormal psychologyand heaven knows iwasoverwroughtwhile still others talk of astral projection of some sort my zeal to catch feldon certainly sent my thoughts ahead toward him and with all his indian magic hed be about the first one to recognise and meet them was he in the railway carriage or was i in the cave on the corpseshaped haunted mountain what would have happened to me had i not delayed him as i did ill confess i dont know and im not sure that i want to know ive never been in mexico sinceand as i said at the start i dont enjoy hearing about electric executions,1
i was shewn into the attic chamber by a grave intelligentlooking man with quiet clothes and an irongrey beard who spoke to me in this fashionyeshelived herebut i dont advise your doing anything your curiosity makes you irresponsiblewenever come here at night and its only because ofhiswill that we keep it this way you know whathedid that abominable society took charge at last and we dont know whereheis buried there was no way the law or anything else could reach the societyi hope you wont stay till after dark and i beg of you to let that thing on the tablethe thing that looks like a match boxalone we dont know what it is but we suspect it has something to do with whathedid we even avoid looking at it very steadilyafter a time the man left me alone in the attic room it was very dingy and dusty and only primitively furnished but it had a neatness which shewed it was not a slumdenizens quarters there were shelves full of theological and classical books and another bookcase containing treatises on magicparacelsus albertus magnus trithemius hermes trismegistus borellus and others in strange alphabets whose titles i could not decipher the furniture was very plain there was a door but it led only into a closet the only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude steep staircase led the windows were of bullseye pattern and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity plainly this house was of the old world i seemed to know where i was but cannot recall what i then knew certainly the town wasnotlondon my impression is of a small seaportthe small object on the table fascinated me intensely i seemed to know what to do with it for i drew a pocket electric lightor what looked like oneout of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes the light was not white but violet and seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment i recall that i did not regard it as a common flashlightindeed ihada common flashlight in another pocketit was getting dark and the ancient roofs and chimneypots outside looked very queer through the bullseye windowpanes finally i summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a bookthen turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it the light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a continuous beam as the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange device they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its centre then i noticed that i was not alone in the roomand put the rayprojector back in my pocketbut the newcomer did not speaknor did i hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments everything was shadowy pantomime as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening hazealthough on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close as if both near and distant according to some abnormal geometrythe newcomer was a thin dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church he was apparently about thirty years old with a sallow olive complexion and fairly good features but an abnormally high forehead his black hair was well cut and neatly brushed and he was cleanshaven though bluechinned with a heavy growth of beard he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen but he had a vastly higher forehead and was darker and more intelligentlookingalso more subtly and concealedlyevillooking at the present momenthaving just lighted a faint oil lamphe looked nervous and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room where the wall slanted sharply which i had not noticed before the flames devoured the volumes greedilyleaping up in strange colours and emitting indescribably hideous odours as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element all at once i saw there were others in the roomgravelooking men in clerical costume one of whom wore the bands and kneebreeches of a bishop though i could hear nothing i could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the firstcomer they seemed to hate and fear him at the same time and he seemed to return these sentiments his face set itself into a grim expression but i could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair the bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace where the flames had died down amidst a charred noncommittal mass and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing the firstcomer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table everyone then seemed frightened the procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor turning and making menacing gestures as they left the bishop was last to gothe firstcomer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope mounting a chair he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak and began making a noose with the other end realising he was about to hang himself i started forward to dissuade or save him he saw me and ceased his preparations looking at me with a kind oftriumphwhich puzzled and disturbed me he slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark thinlipped facei felt somehow in deadly peril and drew out the peculiar rayprojector as a weapon of defence why i thought it could help me i do not know i turned it onfull in his face and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light his expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fearwhich did not however wholly displace the exultation he stopped in his tracksthen flailing his arms wildly in the air began to stagger backward i saw he was edging toward the open stairwell in the floor and tried to shout a warning but he did not hear me in another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to viewi found difficulty in moving toward the stairwell but when i did get there i found no crushed body on the floor below instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tridimensional something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place had there been a noise i had not heard presently the two people simply villagers apparently farthest in the lead saw meand stood paralysed one of them shrieked loudly and reverberentlyahrrh it be ee zur againthen they all turned and fled frantically all that is but one when the crowd was gone i saw the gravebearded man who had brought me to this placestanding alone with a lantern he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly but did not seem afraid then he began to ascend the stairs and joined me in the attic he spokeso youdidntlet it alone im sorry i know what has happened it happened once before but the man got frightened and shot himself you ought not to have madehimcome back you know whathewants but you mustnt get frightened like the other man he got something very strange and terrible has happened to you but it didnt get far enough to hurt your mind and personality if youll keep cool and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life you can keep right on enjoying the world and the fruits of your scholarship but you cant live hereand i dont think youll wish to go back to london id advise americayou mustnt try anything more with thatthing nothing can be put back now it would only make matters worse to door summonanything you are not as badly off as you might bebut you must get out of here at once and stay away youd better thank heaven it didnt go further im going to prepare you as bluntly as i can theres been a certain changein your personal appearancehealways causes that but in a new country you can get used to it theres a mirror up at the other end of the room and im going to take you to it youll get a shockthough you will see nothing repulsivei was now shaking with a deadly fear and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror the faint lamp ie that formerly on the table not the still fainter lantern he had brought in his free hand this is what i saw in the glassa thin dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church apparently about thirty and with rimless steelbowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow olive forehead of abnormal heightit was the silent firstcomer who had burned his booksfor all the rest of my life in outward form i was to be that man,1
when the last days were upon me and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body i loved the irradiate refuge of sleep in my dreams i found a little of the beauty i had vainly sought in life and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woodsonce when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange starsonce when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight iridescent arbours and undying rosesand once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines and pierced by a little gate of bronzemany times i walked through that valley and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral halflight where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk sometimes disclosing the mouldstained stones of buried temples and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vinegrown wall with the little gate of bronze thereinafter a while as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness i would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves and wonder how i might seize them for my eternal dwellingplace so that i need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall i felt that beyond it lay a dreamcountry from which once it was entered there would be no returnso each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall though it was exceedingly well hidden and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely but more lovely and radiant as wellthen one night in the dreamcity of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dreamsages who dwelt of old in that city and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world therein were written many things concerning the world of dream and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate when i saw this lore i knew that it touched on the scenes i had haunted and i therefore read long in the yellowed papyrussome of the dreamsages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate but others told of horror and disappointment i knew not which to believe yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through i resolved to take it when next i awakedlast night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves and when i came this time to the antique wall i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples and i drifted on songfully expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never returnbut as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through i knew that all sights and glories were at an end for in that new realm was neither land nor sea but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space so happier than i had ever dared hoped to be i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and desolate hour,1
ilife is a hideous thing and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous science already oppressive with its shocking revelations will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human speciesif separate species we befor its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world if we knew what we are we should do as sir arthur jermyn did and arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night no one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been for certain papers and a certain boxedobjectwere found which made men wish to forget some who knew him do not admit that he ever existedarthur jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxedobjectwhich had come from africa it was thisobjectand not his peculiar personal appearance which made him end his life many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded learning was in his blood for his greatgrandfather sir robert jermyn bt had been an anthropologist of note whilst his greatgreatgreatgrandfather sir wade jermyn was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region and had written eruditely of its tribes animals and supposed antiquities indeed old sir wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his bookobservations on the several parts of africawas published in 1765 this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdonmadness was in all the jermyns and people were glad there were not many of them the line put forth no branches and arthur was the last of it if he had not been one cannot say what he would have done when theobjectcame the jermyns never seemed to look quite rightsomething was amiss though arthur was the worst and the old family portraits in jermyn house shewed fine faces enough before sir wades time certainly the madness began with sir wade whose wild stories of africa were at once the delight and terror of his few friends it shewed in his collection of trophies and specimens which were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve and appeared strikingly in the oriental seclusion in which he kept his wife the latter he had said was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa and did not like english ways she with an infant son born in africa had accompanied him back from the second and longest of his trips and had gone with him on the third and last never returning no one had ever seen her closely not even the servants for her disposition had been violent and singular during her brief stay at jermyn house she occupied a remote wing and was waited on by her husband alone sir wade was indeed most peculiar in his solicitude for his family for when he returned to africa he would permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman from guinea upon coming back after the death of lady jermyn he himself assumed complete care of the boybut it was the talk of sir wade especially when in his cups which chiefly led his friends to deem him mad in a rational age like the eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild sights and strange scenes under a congo moon of the gigantic walls and pillars of a forgotten city crumbling and vinegrown and of damp silent stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness of abysmal treasurevaults and inconceivable catacombs especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged cityfabulous creatures which even a pliny might describe with scepticism things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars the vaults and the weird carvings yet after he came home for the last time sir wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest mostly after his third glass at the knights head boasting of what he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to him and finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse he had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon for his mind moved curiously ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy he had liked his home less and less till at last he had seemed to dread it the knights head had been his headquarters and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection three years later he diedwade jermyns son philip was a highly peculiar person despite a strong physical resemblance to his father his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned though he did not inherit the madness which was feared by some he was densely stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence in frame he was small but intensely powerful and was of incredible agility twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper a person said to be of gypsy extraction but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor completing the general disgust which his habits and mesalliance had begun after the close of the american war he was heard of as a sailor on a merchantman in the african trade having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the congo coastin the son of sir philip jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange and fatal turn tall and fairly handsome with a sort of weird eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion robert jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator it was he who first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from africa and who made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration in 1815 sir robert married a daughter of the seventh viscount brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three children the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body saddened by these family misfortunes the scientist sought relief in work and made two long expeditions in the interior of africa in 1849 his second son nevil a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of philip jermyn with the hauteur of the brightholmes ran away with a vulgar dancer but was pardoned upon his return in the following year he came back to jermyn house a widower with an infant son alfred who was one day to be the father of arthur jermynfriends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of sir robert jermyn yet it was probably merely a bit of african folklore which caused the disaster the elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the onga tribes near the field of his grandfathers and his own explorations hoping in some way to account for sir wades wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures a certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madmans imagination might have been stimulated by native myths on october 19 1852 the explorer samuel seaton called at jermyn house with a manuscript of notes collected among the ongas believing that certain legends of a grey city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist in his conversation he probably supplied many additional details the nature of which will never be known since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into being when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer and before he could be restrained had put an end to all three of his children the two who were never seen and the son who had run away nevil jermyn died in the successful defence of his own twoyearold son who had apparently been included in the old mans madly murderous scheme sir robert himself after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter any articulate sound died of apoplexy in the second year of his confinementsir alfred jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday but his tastes never matched his title at twenty he had joined a band of musichall performers and at thirtysix had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant american circus his end was very revolting among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers with this gorilla alfred jermyn was singularly fascinated and on many occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars eventually jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal astonishing audiences and fellowperformers alike with his success one morning in chicago as the gorilla and alfred jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match the former delivered a blow of more than usual force hurting both the body and dignity of the amateur trainer of what followed members of the greatest show on earth do not like to speak they did not expect to hear sir alfred jermyn emit a shrill inhuman scream or to see him seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands dash it to the floor of the cage and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat the gorilla was off its guard but not for long and before anything could be done by the regular trainer the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognitioniiarthur jermyn was the son of sir alfred jermyn and a musichall singer of unknown origin when the husband and father deserted his family the mother took the child to jermyn house where there was none left to object to her presence she was not without notions of what a noblemans dignity should be and saw to it that her son received the best education which limited money could provide the family resources were now sadly slender and jermyn house had fallen into woeful disrepair but young arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents he was not like any other jermyn who had ever lived for he was a poet and a dreamer some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old sir wade jermyns unseen portuguese wife declared that her latin blood must be shewing itself but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty attributing it to his musichall mother who was socially unrecognised the poetic delicacy of arthur jermyn was the more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance most of the jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast but arthurs case was very striking it is hard to say just what he resembled but his expression his facial angle and the length of his arms gave a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first timeit was the mind and character of arthur jermyn which atoned for his aspect gifted and learned he took highest honours at oxford and seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family though of poetic rather than scientific temperament he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in african ethnology and antiquities utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of sir wade with his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latters wilder notes and paragraphs for the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his greatgrandfather and samuel seaton amongst the ongasin 1911 after the death of his mother sir arthur jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the congo arranging with the belgian authorities for a party of guides he spent a year in the onga and kaliri country finding data beyond the highest of his expectations among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu who possessed not only a highly retentive memory but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to himaccording to mwanu the grey city and the hybrid creatures were no more having been annihilated by the warlike nbangus many years ago this tribe after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest the white apegoddess which the strange beings worshipped and which was held by congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among those beings just what the white apelike creatures could have been mwanu had no idea but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city jermyn could form no conjecture but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddessthe apeprincess it was said became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the west for a long time they had reigned over the city together but when they had a son all three went away later the god and the princess had returned and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone where it was worshipped then he had departed alone the legend here seemed to present three variants according to one story nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it it was for this reason that the nbangus carried it off a second story told of the gods return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife a third told of the return of the son grown to manhoodor apehood or godhood as the case might beyet unconscious of his identity surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendryof the reality of the jungle city described by old sir wade arthur jermyn had no further doubt and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came upon what was left of it its size must have been exaggerated yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere negro village unfortunately no carvings could be found and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which sir wade had mentioned the white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region but it remained for a european to improve on the data offered by old mwanu m verhaeren belgian agent at a tradingpost on the congo believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess of which he had vaguely heard since the once mighty nbangus were now the submissive servants of king alberts government and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off when jermyn sailed for england therefore it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his greatgreatgreatgrandfathers narrativesthat is the wildest which he had ever heard countrymen near jermyn house had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to sir wade around the tables of the knights headarthur jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from m verhaeren meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor he began to feel closely akin to sir wade and to seek relics of the latters personal life in england as well as of his african exploits oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous but no tangible relic of her stay at jermyn house remained jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement and decided that the husbands insanity was the prime cause his greatgreatgreatgrandmother he recalled was said to have been the daughter of a portuguese trader in africa no doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the dark continent had caused her to flout sir wades talk of the interior a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive she had died in africa perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told but as jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility a century and a half after the death of both of his strange progenitorsin june 1913 a letter arrived from m verhaeren telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess it was the belgian averred a most extraordinary object an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition time and the congo climate are not kind to mummies especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here around the creatures neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs no doubt some hapless travellers keepsake taken by the nbangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm in commenting on the contour of the mummys face m verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison or rather expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his correspondent but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity the stuffed goddess he wrote would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letterthe boxed object was delivered at jermyn house on the afternoon of august 3 1913 being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of african specimens as arranged by sir robert and arthur what ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined of the various tales that of aged soames the family butler is most ample and coherent according to this trustworthy man sir arthur jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box though the instant sound of hammer and chisel shewed that he did not delay the operation nothing was heard for some time just how long soames cannot exactly estimate but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream undoubtedly in jermyns voice was heard immediately afterward jermyn emerged from the room rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy the expression on his face a face ghastly enough in repose was beyond description when near the front door he seemed to think of something and turned back in his flight finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar the servants were utterly dumbfounded and watched at the head of the stairs but their master did not return a smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below after dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard and a stableboy saw arthur jermyn glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house then in an exaltation of supreme horror everyone saw the end a spark appeared on the moor a flame arose and a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens the house of jermyn no longer existedthe reason why arthur jermyns charred fragments were not collected and buried lies in what was found afterward principally the thing in the box the stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight withered and eaten away but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species less hairy than any recorded variety and infinitely nearer mankindquite shockingly so detailed description would be rather unpleasant but two salient particulars must be told for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of sir wade jermyns african expeditions and with the congolese legends of the white god and the apeprincess the two particulars in question are these the arms on the golden locket about the creatures neck were the jermyn arms and the jocose suggestion of m verhaeren about a certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid ghastly and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive arthur jermyn greatgreatgreatgrandson of sir wade jermyn and an unknown wife members of the royal anthropological institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well and some of them do not admit that arthur jermyn ever existed,1
efficiunt daemones ut quae non sunt sic tamenquasi sint conspicienda hominibus exhibeantlactantiusi was far from home and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me in the twilight i heard it pounding on the rocks and i knew it lay just over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening and because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond i pushed on through the shallow newfallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to where aldebaran twinkled among the trees on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but often dreamed ofit was the yuletide that men call christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon older than memphis and mankind it was the yuletide and i had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten mine were an old people and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before and they were strange because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blueeyed fishers and now they were scattered and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand i was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade for only the poor and the lonely rememberthen beyond the hills crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples ridgepoles and chimneypots wharves and small bridges willowtrees and graveyards endless labyrinths of steep narrow crooked streets and dizzy churchcrowned central peak that time durst not touch ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a childs disordered blocks antiquity hovering on grey wings over winterwhitened gables and gambrel roofs fanlights and smallpaned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join orion and the archaic stars and against the rotting wharves the sea pounded the secretive immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder timebeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose bleak and windswept and i saw that it was a buryingground where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse the printless road was very lonely and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in 1692 but i did not know just whereas the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry sounds of a village at evening but did not hear them then i thought of the season and felt that these old puritan folk might well have christmas customs strange to me and full of silent hearthside prayer so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers but kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and seataverns creaked in the salt breeze and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little curtained windowsi had seen maps of the town and knew where to find the home of my people it was told that i should be known and welcomed for village legend lives long so i hastened through back street to circle court and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town to where green lane leads off behind the market house the old maps still held good and i had no trouble though at arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place since i saw not a wire overhead snow would have hid the rails in any case i was glad i had chosen to walk for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill and now i was eager to knock at the door of my people the seventh house on the left in green lane with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second story all built before 1650there were lights inside the house when i came upon it and i saw from the diamond windowpanes that it must have been kept very close to its antique state the upper part overhung the narrow grassgrown street and nearly met the overhanging part of the house opposite so that i was almost in a tunnel with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow there was no sidewalk but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings it was an odd scene and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before though it pleased me i would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow and people in the streets and a few windows without drawn curtainswhen i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid some fear had been gathering in me perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage and the bleakness of the evening and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs and when my knock was answered i was fully afraid because i had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open but i was not afraid long for the gowned slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me and though he made signs that he was dumb he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carriedhe beckoned me into a low candlelit room with massive exposed rafters and dark stiff sparse furniture of the seventeenth century the past was vivid there for not an attribute was missing there was a cavernous fireplace and a spinningwheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep pokebonnet sat back toward me silently spinning despite the festive season an indefinite dampness seemed upon the place and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing the highbacked settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left and seemed to be occupied though i was not sure i did not like everything about what i saw and felt again the fear i had had this fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it for the more i looked at the old mans bland face the more its very blandness terrified me the eyes never moved and the skin was too like wax finally i was sure it was not a face at all but a fiendishly cunning mask but the flabby hands curiously gloved wrote genially on the tablet and told me i must wait a while before i could be led to the place of festivalpointing to a chair table and pile of books the old man now left the room and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and mouldy and that they included old morrysters wildmarvells of sciencethe terriblesaducismus triumphatusof joseph glanvill published in 1681 the shockingdaemonolatreiaof remigius printed in 1595 at lyons and worst of all the unmentionablenecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius forbidden latin translation a book which i had never seen but of which i had heard monstrous things whispered no one spoke to me but i could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning spinning i thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings i resolved to expect queer things so i tried to read and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursednecronomicona thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced as if it had been stealthily opened it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old womans spinningwheel this was not much though for the old woman was spinning very hard and the aged clock had been striking after that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume and sat down on that very bench so that i could not see him it was certainly nervous waiting and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so when eleven struck however the old man stood up glided to a massive carved chest in a corner and got two hooded cloaks one of which he donned and the other of which he draped round the old woman who was ceasing her monotonous spinning then they both started for the outer door the woman lamely creeping and the old man after picking up the very book i had been reading beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or maskwe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient town went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one and the dog star leered at the throng of cowled cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that past the creaking signs and antediluvian gables the thatched roofs and diamondpaned windows threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellationsamid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy but seeing never a face and hearing never a word up up up the eerie columns slithered and i saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town where perched a great white church i had seen it from the roads crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk and it had made me shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spirethere was an open space around the church partly a churchyard with spectral shafts and partly a halfpaved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables deathfires danced over the tombs revealing gruesome vistas though queerly failing to cast any shadows past the churchyard where there were no houses i could see over the hills summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour though the town was invisible in the dark only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church i waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway and till all the stragglers had followed the old man was pulling at my sleeve but i was determined to be the last then i finally went the sinister man and the old spinning woman before me crossing the threshold into that swarming temple of unknown darkness i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement and as i did so i shuddered for though the wind had not left much snow a few patches did remain on the path near the door and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet not even minethe church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it for most of the throng had already vanished they had streamed up the aisle between the high white pews to the trapdoor of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit and were now squirming noiselessly in i followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the dank suffocating crypt the tail of that sinuous line of nightmarchers seemed very horrible and as i saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still then i noticed that the tombs floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of roughhewn stone a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar it was a silent shocking descent and i observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature as if chiselled out of the solid rock what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes after more aeons of descent i saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery soon they became excessively numerous like impious catacombs of nameless menace and their pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evilthen i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters again i shivered for i did not like the things that the night had brought and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite as the steps and the passage grew broader i heard another sound the thin whining mockery of a feeble flute and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner worlda vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial oceanfainting and gasping i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan toadstools leprous fire and slimy water and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar it was the yulerite older than man and fated to survive him the primal rite of the solstice and of springs promise beyond the snows the rite of fire and evergreen light and music and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the rite and adore the sick pillar of flame and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare i saw this and i saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light piping noisomely on a flute and as the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where i could not see but what frightened me most was that flaming column spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable casting no shadows as healthy flame should and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty venomous verdigris for in all that seething combustion no warmth lay but only the clamminess of death and corruptionthe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he faced at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance especially when he held above his head that abhorrentnecronomiconhe had taken with him and i shared all the obeisances because i had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers then the old man made a signal to the halfseen fluteplayer in the darkness which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world but only of the mad spaces between the starsout of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny unheard and unsuspected there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame trained hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp or sound brain ever wholly remember they were not altogether crows nor moles nor buzzards nor ants nor vampire bats nor decomposed human beings but something i cannot and must not recall they flopped limply along half with their webbed feet and half with their membraneous wings and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataractsthe old spinning woman had gone with the throng and the old man remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest i saw when i staggered to my feet that the amorphous fluteplayer had rolled out of sight but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by as i hung back the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place that it had been decreed i should come back and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed he wrote this in a very ancient hand and when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch both with my family arms to prove that he was what he said but it was a hideous proof because i knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather in 1698presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face but i only shuddered because i was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask the flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the lichens and i saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself when one of the things began to waddle and edge away he turned quickly to stop it so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head and then because that nightmares position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come i flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea flung myself into that putrescent juice of earths inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pestgulfs might concealat the hospital they told me i had been found half frozen in kingsport harbour at dawn clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before and fallen over the cliffs at orange point a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow there was nothing i could say because everything was wrong everything was wrong with the broad window shewing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below they insisted that this was kingsport and i could not deny it when i went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on central hill they sent me to st marys hospital in arkham where i could have better care i liked it there for the doctors were broadminded and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazreds objectionablenecronomiconfrom the library of miskatonic university they said something about a psychosis and agreed i had better get any harassing obsessions off my mindso i read again that hideous chapter and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me i had seen it before let footprints tell what they might and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten there was no onein waking hourswho could remind me of it but my dreams are filled with terror because of phrases i dare not quote i dare quote only one paragraph put into such english as i can make from the awkward low latinthe nethermost caverns wrote the mad arab are not for the fathoming of eyes that see for their marvels are strange and terrific cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied and evil the mind that is held by no head wisely did ibn schacabac say that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes for it is of old rumour that the soul of the devilbought hastes not from his charnel clay but fats and instructsthe very worm that gnawstill out of corruption horrid life springs and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it great holes secretly are digged where earths pores ought to suffice and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl,1
horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend crawford tillinghast i had not seen him since that day two months and a half before when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage i had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine eating little and excluding even the servants but i had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature it is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed the eyes sunken circled and uncannily glowing the forehead veined and corrugated and the hands tremulous and twitching and if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness a wild disorder of dress a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once cleanshaven the cumulative effect is quite shocking but such was the aspect of crawford tillinghast on the night his halfcoherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me candle in hand and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient lonely house set back from benevolent streetthat crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake these things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action despair if he fail in his quest and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed tillinghast had once been the prey of failure solitary and melancholy but now i knew with nauseating fears of my own that he was the prey of success i had indeed warned him ten weeks before when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover he had been flushed and excited then talking in a high and unnatural though always pedantic voicewhat do we know he had said of the world and the universe about us our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow we see things only as we are constructed to see them and can gain no idea of their absolute nature with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos yet other beings with a wider stronger or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see but might see and study whole worlds of matter energy and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have i have always believed that such strange inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbowsand now i believe i have found a way to break down the barriersi am not joking within twentyfour hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised senseorgans that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life we shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight we shall see these things and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen we shall overleap time space and dimensions and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creationwhen tillinghast said these things i remonstrated for i knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused but he was a fanatic and drove me from the house now he was no less a fanatic but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment and he had written me imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognise as i entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle i became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light and i sickened at the hollow altered voice of my host i wished the servants were about and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously it seemed strange that old gregory at least should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rageyet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could only guess but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart i could not doubt before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit terrible though the cost of victory appeared up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man the electricity seemed to be turned off and when i asked my guide he said it was for a definite reasonit would be too much i would not dare he continued to mutter i especially noted his new habit of muttering for it was not like him to talk to himself we entered the laboratory in the attic and i observed that detestable electrical machine glowing with a sickly sinister violet luminosity it was connected with a powerful chemical battery but seemed to be receiving no current for i recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action in reply to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that i could understandhe now seated me near the machine so that it was on my right and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs the usual sputtering began turned to a whine and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence meanwhile the luminosity increased waned again then assumed a pale outr colour or blend of colours which i could neither place nor describe tillinghast had been watching me and noted my puzzled expressiondo you know what that is he whispered that is ultraviolet he chuckled oddly at my surprise you thought ultraviolet was invisible and so it isbut you can see that and many other invisible thingsnowlisten to me the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity i have seentruthand i intend to shew it to you do you wonder how it will seem i will tell you here tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes your existing senseorgansears first i thinkwill pick up many of the impressions for they are closely connected with the dormant organs then there will be others you have heard of the pineal gland i laugh at the shallow endocrinologist fellowdupe and fellowparvenu of the freudian that gland is the great senseorgan of organsi have found outit is like sight in the end and transmits visual pictures to the brain if you are normal that is the way you ought to get most of it i mean get most of the evidence frombeyondi looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall dimly lit by rays which the everyday eye cannot see the far corners were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm during the interval that tillinghast was silent i fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of longdead gods some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision the picture was very vivid for a while but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception that of utter absolute solitude in infinite sightless soundless space there seemed to be a void and nothing more and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver i always carried after dark since the night i was held up in east providence then from the farthermost regions of remoteness thesoundsoftly glided into existence it was infinitely faint subtly vibrant and unmistakably musical but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound as i waited breathlessly i perceived that both sound and wind were increasing the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive i began to speak to tillinghast and as i did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished i saw only the man the glowing machine and the dim apartment tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i if not a great deal more i whispered what i had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possibledont move he cautioned for in these rayswe are able to be seen as well as to seei told you the servants left but i didnt tell youhowit was that thickwitted housekeepershe turned on the lights downstairs after i had warned her not to and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations it must have been frightfuli could hear the screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hearing from another direction and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house mrs updikes clothes were close to the front hall switchthats how i know she did it it got them all but so long as we dont move were fairly safe remember were dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless keep stillthe combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what tillinghast called beyond i was now in a vortex of sound and motion with confused pictures before my eyes i saw the blurred outlines of the room but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognisable shapes or clouds penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me then i glimpsed the templelike effect again but this time the pillars reached up into an arial ocean of light which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen before after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic and in the jumble of sights sounds and unidentified senseimpressions i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form one definite flash i shall always remember i seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining revolving spheres and as it receded i saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape this shape being the distorted face of crawford tillinghast at another time i felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionallywalking or drifting through my supposedly solid bodyand thought i saw tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually i recalled what he had said of the pineal gland and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eyesuddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which though vague held the elements of consistency and permanence it was indeed somewhat familiar for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre i saw the attic laboratory the electrical machine and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien unknown entities it likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa foremost among the living objects were great inky jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine they were present in loathsome profusion and i saw to my horror that theyoverlappedthat they were semifluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids these things were never still but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose sometimes they appeared to devour one another the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants and could not exclude the things from my mind as i strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us but tillinghast had been watching me and was speakingyou see them you see them you see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life you see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky have i not succeeded in breaking down the barrier have i not shewn you worlds that no other living men have seen i heard him scream through the horrible chaos and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine his eyes were pits of flame and they glared at me with what i now saw was overwhelming hatred the machine droned detestablyyou think those floundering things wiped out the servants fool they are harmless but the servantsaregone arent they you tried to stop me you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i could get you were afraid of the cosmic truth you damned coward but now ive got you what swept up the servants what made them scream so loud dont know eh youll know soon enough look at melisten to what i saydo you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude do you fancy there are such things as form or matter i tell you i have struck depths that your little brain cant picture i have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars i have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness space belongs to me do you hear things are hunting me nowthe things that devour and dissolvebut i know how to elude them it is you they will get as they got the servants stirring dear sir i told you it was dangerous to move i have saved you so far by telling you to keep stillsaved you to see more sights and to listen to me if you had moved they would have been at you long ago dont worry they wonthurtyou they didnt hurt the servantsit wasseeingthat made the poor devils scream so my pets are not pretty for they come out of places where aesthetic standards arevery differentdisintegration is quite painless i assure youbuti want you to see themi almost saw them but i knew how to stop you are not curious i always knew you were no scientist trembling eh trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things i have discovered why dont you move then tired well dont worry my friendfor they are coming look look curse you look its just over your left shoulder what remains to be told is very brief and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast house and found us theretillinghast dead and me unconscious they arrested me because the revolver was in my hand but released me in three hours after they found it was apoplexy which had finished tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor i did not tell very much of what i had seen for i feared the coroner would be sceptical but from the evasive outline i did give the doctor told me that i had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madmani wish i could believe that doctor it would help my shaky nerves if i could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me i never feel alone or comfortable and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary what prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple factthat the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast murdered,1
imoonmadness a touch of fever i wish i could think so but when i am alone after dark in the waste places where my wanderings take me and hear across infinite voids the demon echoes of those screams and snarls and that detestable crunching of bones i shudder again at the memory of that eldritch nighti knew less of woodcraft in those days though the wilderness called just as strongly to me as it does now up to that night i had always been careful to employ a guide but circumstances now suddenly forced me to a trial of my own skill it was midsummer in maine and despite my great need to get from mayfair to glendale by the next noon i could find no person willing to pilot me unless i took the long route through potowisset which would not bring me to my goal in time there would be dense forests to penetrate yet whenever i asked for a guide i was met with refusal and evasionstranger that i was it seemed odd that everyone should have glib excuses there was too much important business on hand for such a sleepy village and i knew that the natives were lying but they all had imperative duties or said that they had and would do no more than assure me that the trail through the woods was very plain running due north and not in the least difficult for a vigorous young fellow if i started while the morning was still early they averred i could get to glendale by sundown and avoid a night in the open even then i suspected nothing the prospect seemed good and i resolved to try it alone let the lazy villagers hang back as they might probably i would have tried it even if i had suspected for youth is stubborn and from childhood i had only laughed at superstition and old wives talesso before the sun was high i had started off through the trees at a swinging stride lunch in my hand guardian automatic in my pocket and belt filled with crisp bills of large denominations from the distances given me and a knowledge of my own speed i had figured on making glendale a little after sunset but i knew that even if detained over night through some miscalculation i had plenty of camping experience to fall back on besides my presence at my destination was not really necessary till the following noonit was the weather that set my plans awry as the sun rose higher it scorched through even the thickest of the foliage and burned up my energy at every step by noon my clothes were soaking with perspiration and i felt myself faltering in spite of all my resolution as i pushed deeper into the woods i found the trail greatly obstructed with underbrush and at many points nearly effaced it must have been weeksperhaps monthssince anyone had broken his way through and i began to wonder if i could after all live up to my scheduleat length having grown very hungry i looked for the deepest patch of shade i could find and proceeded to eat the lunch which the hotel had prepared for me there were some indifferent sandwiches a piece of stale pie and a bottle of very light wine by no means sumptuous fare but welcome enough to one in my state of overheated exhaustionit was too hot for smoking to be of any solace so i did not take out my pipe instead i stretched myself at full length under the trees when my meal was done intent on stealing a few moments rest before commencing the last lap of my journey i suppose i was a fool to drink that wine for light though it was it proved just enough to finish the work the sultry oppressive day had begun my plan called for the merest momentary relaxation yet with scarcely a warning yawn i dropped off into a sound slumberiiwhen i opened my eyes twilight was closing in about me a wind fanned my cheeks restoring me quickly to full perception and as i glanced up at the sky i saw with apprehension that black racing clouds were leading on a solid wall of darkness prophetic of violent thunderstorm i knew now that i could not reach glendale before morning but the prospect of a night in the woodsmy first night of lone forest campingbecame very repugnant under these trying conditions in a moment i decided to push along for a while at least in the hope of finding some shelter before the tempest should breakdarkness spread over the woods like a heavy blanket the lowering clouds grew more threatening and the wind increased to a veritable gale a flash of distant lightning illuminated the sky followed by an ominous rumble that seemed to hint of malign pursuit then i felt a drop of rain on my outstretched hand and though still walking on automatically resigned myself to the inevitable another moment and i had seen the light the light of a window through the trees and the darkness eager only for shelter i hastened toward itwould to god i had turned and fledthere was a sort of imperfect clearing on the farther side of which with its back against the primeval wood stood a building i had expected a shanty or logcabin but stopped short in surprise when i beheld a neat and tasteful little house of two stories some seventy years old by its architecture yet still in a state of repair betokening the closest and most civilized attention through the small panes of one of the lower windows a bright light shone and toward thisspurred by the impact of another raindropi presently hurried across the clearing rapping loudly on the doors as soon as i gained the stepswith startling promptness my knock was answered by a deep pleasant voice which uttered the single syllable comepushing open the unlocked door i entered a shadowy hall lighted by an open doorway at the right beyond which was a booklined room with the gleaming window as i closed the outer door behind me i could not help noticing a peculiar odor about the house a faint elusive scarcely definable odor which somehow suggested animals my host i surmised must be a hunter or trapper with his business conducted on the premisesthe man who had spoken sat in a capacious easychair beside a marbletopped center table a long loungingrobe of gray swathing his lean form the light from a powerful argand lamp threw his features into prominence and as he eyed me curiously i studied him in no less detail he was strikingly handsome with thin cleanshaven face glossy flaxen hair neatly brushed long regular eyebrows that met in a slanting angle above the nose shapely ears set low and well back on the head and large expressive gray eyes almost luminous in their animation when he smiled a welcome he showed a magnificently even set of firm white teeth and as he waved me to a chair i was struck by the fineness of his slender hands with their long tapering fingers whose ruddy almondshaped nails were slightly curved and exquisitely manicured i could not help wondering why a man of such engaging personality should choose the life of a reclusesorry to intrude i ventured but ive given up the hope of making glendale before morning and theres a storm coming on which sent me looking for cover as if to corroborate my words there came at this point a vivid flash a crashing reverberation and the first breaking of a torrential downpour that beat maniacally against the windowsmy host seemed oblivious to the elements and flashed me another smile when he answered his voice was soothing and well modulated and his eyes held a calmness almost hypnoticyoure welcome to whatever hospitality i can offer but im afraid it wont be much ive a game leg so youll have to do most of the waiting on yourself if youre hungry youll find plenty in the kitchenplenty of food if not of ceremony it seemed to me that i could detect the slightest trace of a foreign accent in his tone though his language was fluently correct and idiomaticrising to an impressive height he headed for the door with long limping steps and i noticed the huge hairy arms that hung at his side in such curious contrast with his delicate handscome he suggested bring the lamp along with you i might as well sit in the kitchen as herei followed him into the hall and the room across it and at his direction ransacked the woodpile in the corner and the cupboard on the wall a few moments later when the fire was going nicely i asked him if i might not prepare food for both but he courteously declinedits too hot to eat he told me besides i had a bite before you cameafter washing the dishes left from my lone meal i sat down for a while smoking my pipe contentedly my host asked a few questions about the neighboring villages but lapsed into sullen taciturnity when he learned i was an outsider as he brooded there silently i could not help feeling a quality of strangeness in him some subtle alienage that could hardly be analyzed i was quite certain for one thing that he was tolerating me because of the storm rather than welcoming me with genuine hospitalityas for the storm it seemed almost to have spent itself outside it was already growing lighterfor there was a full moon behind the cloudsand the rain had dwindled to a trivial drizzle perhaps i thought i could now resume my journey after all an idea which i suggested to my hostbetter wait till morning he remarked you say youre afoot and its a good three hours to glendale ive two bedrooms upstairs and youre welcome to one of them if you care to staythere was a sincerity in his invitation which dispelled any doubts i had held regarding his hospitality and i now concluded that his silences must be the result of long isolation from his fellows in this wilderness after sitting without a word through three fillings of my pipe i finally began to yawnits been rather a strenuous day for me i admitted and i guess id better be making tracks for bed i want to be up at sunrise you know and on my waymy host waved his arm toward the door through which i could see the hall and the staircasetake the lamp with you he instructed its the only one i have but i dont mind sitting in the dark really half the time i dont light it at all when im alone oil is so hard to get out here and i go to the village so seldom your room is the one on the right at the head of the stairstaking the lamp and turning in the hall to say goodnight i could see his eyes glowing almost phosphorescently in the darkened room i had left and i was half reminded for a moment of the jungle and the circles of eyes that sometimes glow just beyond the radius of the campfire then i started upstairsas i reached the second floor i could hear my host limping across the hall to the other room below and perceived that he moved with owlish sureness despite the darkness truly he had but little need of the lamp the storm was over and as i entered the room assigned me i found it bright with the rays of a full moon that streamed on the bed from an uncurtained south window blowing out the lamp and leaving the house in darkness but for the moonbeams i sniffed at the pungent odor that rose above the scent of the kerosenethe quasianimal odor i had noticed on first entering the place i crossed to the window and threw it wide breathing deep of the cool fresh night airwhen i started to undress i paused almost instantly recalling my money belt still in its place about my waist possibly i reflected it would be well not to be too hasty or unguarded for i had read of men who seized just such an opportunity to rob and even to murder the stranger within their dwelling so arranging the bedclothes to look as if they covered a sleeping figure i drew the rooms only chair into the concealing shadows filled and lighted my pipe again and sat down to rest or watch as the occasion might demandiiii could not have been sitting there long when my sensitive ears caught the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs all the old lore of robber landlords rushed on me afresh when another moment revealed that the steps were plain loud and careless with no attempt at concealment while my hosts tread as i had heard it from the head of the staircase was a soft limping stride shaking the ashes from my pipe i slipped it in my pocket then seizing and drawing my automatic i rose from the chair tiptoed across the room and crouched tensely in a spot which the opening door would coverthe door opened and into the shaft of moonlight stepped a man i had never seen before tall broadshouldered and distinguished his face half hidden by a heavy squarecut beard and his neck buried in a high black stock of a pattern long obsolete in america he was indubitably a foreigner how he could have entered the house without my knowledge was quite beyond me nor could i believe for an instant that he had been concealed in either of the two rooms or the hall below me as i gazed intently at him in the insidious moonbeams it seemed to me that i could see directly through his sturdy form but perhaps this was only an illusion that came from my shock of surprisenoticing the disarray of the bed but evidently missing the intended effect of occupancy the stranger muttered something to himself in a foreign tongue and proceeded to disrobe flinging his clothes into the chair i had vacated he crept into bed pulled the covers over him and in a moment or two was breathing with the regular respiration of a sound sleepermy first thought was to seek out my host and demand an explanation but a second later i deemed it better to make sure that the whole incident was not a mere delusive aftereffect of my winedrugged sleep in the woods i still felt weak and faint and despite my recent supper was as hungry as if i had not eaten since that noonday lunchi crossed to the bed reached out and grasped at the shoulder of the sleeping man then barely checking a cry of mad fright and dizzy astonishment i fell back with pounding pulse and dilated eyesfor my clutching fingers had passed directly through the sleeping form and seized only the sheet belowa complete analysis of my jarred and jumbled sensations would be futile the man was intangible yet i could still see him there hear his regular breathing and watch his figure as it half turned beneath the clothes and then as i was quite certain of my own madness or hypnosis i heard other footsteps on the stairs soft padded doglike limping footsteps pattering up up up and again that pungent animal smell this time in redoubled volume dazed and dreamdrowsed i crept once more behind the protecting opened door shaken to the marrow but now resigned to any fate known or namelessthen into that shaft of eerie moonlight stepped the gaunt form of a great gray wolf limped i should have said for one hind foot was held in the air as though wounded by some stray shot the beast turned its head in my direction and as it did so the pistol dropped from my twitching fingers and clattered unheeded to the floor the ascending succession of horrors was fast paralyzing my will and consciousness forthe eyes that now glared toward me from that hellish head were the gray phosphorescent eyes of my host as they had peered at me through the darkness of the kitcheni do not yet know whether it saw me the eyes turned from my direction to the bed and gazed gluttonously on the spectral sleeping form there then the head tilted back and from that demon throat came the most shocking ululation i have ever heard a thick nauseous lupine howl that made my heart stand still the form on the bed stirred opened his eyes and shrank from what he saw the animal crouched quivering and thenas the ethereal figure uttered a shriek of mortal human anguish and terror that no ghost of legend could counterfeitsprang straight for its victims throat its white firm even teeth flashing in the moonlight as they closed on the jugular vein of the screaming phantasm the scream ended in a bloodchoked gurgle and the frightened human eyes turned glassythat scream had roused me to action and in a second i had retrieved my automatic and emptied its entire contents into the wolfish monstrosity before mebut i heard the unhindered thud of each bullet as it imbedded itself in the opposite wallmy nerves gave way blind fear hurled me toward the door and blind fear prompted the one backward glance in which i saw that the wolf had sunk its teeth into the body of its quarry then came that culminating sensory impression and the devastating thought to which it gave birth this was the same body i had thrust my handthrougha few moments before and yet as i plunged down that black nightmare staircasei could hear the crunching of bonesivhow i found the trail to glendale or how i managed to traverse it i suppose i shall never know i only know that sunrise found me on the hill at the edge of the woods with the steepled village outspread below me and the blue thread of the cataqua sparkling in the distance hatless coatless ashenfaced and as soaked with perspiration as if i had spent the night abroad in the storm i hesitated to enter the village till i had recovered at least some outward semblance of composure at last i picked my way down hill and through the narrow streets with their flagstone sidewalks and colonial doorways till i reached the lafayette house whose proprietor eyed me askancewhere from so early son and why the wild lookive just come through the woods from mayfairyoucamethroughthe devils woodslast nightandalone the old man stared with a queer look of alternate horror and incredulitywhy not i countered i couldnt have made it in time through potowisset and i had to be here not later than this noonand last night wasfull moon my gawd he eyed me curiously see anything of vasili oukranikov or the countsay do i look that simple what are you trying to dojolly mebut his tone was as grave as a priests as he replied you must be new to these parts sonny if you werent youd know all about devils woods and the full moon and vasili and the resti felt anything but flippant yet knew i must not seem serious after my earlier remarks go oni know youre dying to tell me im like a donkeyall earsthen he told the legend in his dry way stripping it of vitality and convincingness through lack of coloring detail and atmosphere but for me it needed no vitality or convincingness that any poet could have given remember what i had witnessed and remember that i had never heard of the tale untilafteri had had the experience and fled from the terror of those crunched phantom bonesthere used to be quite a few russians scattered betwixt here and mayfairthey came after one of their nihilist troubles back in russia vasili oukranikov was one of ema tall thin handsome chap with shiny yellow hair and a wonderful manner they said though that he was a servant of the devila werewolf and eater of menhe built him a house in the woods about a third of the way from here to mayfair and lived all alone every once in a while a traveler would come out of the woods with some pretty strange tale about being chased by a big wolf with shining human eyeslike oukranikovs one night somebody took a pot shot at the wolf and the next time the russian came into glendale he walked with a limp that settled it there wasnt any mere suspicion now but hard factsthen he sent to mayfair for the counthis name was feodor tchernevsky and he had bought the old gambrelroofed fowler place up state streetto come out and see him they all warned the count for he was a fine man and a splendid neighbor but he said he could take care of himself all right it was the night of the full moon he was brave as they make em and all he did was to tell some men he had around the place to follow him to vasilis if he didnt show up in decent time they didand you tell me sonny that youve been through those woods at nightsure i tell youi tried to appear nonchalantim no count and here i am to tell the tale but what did the men find at oukranikovs housethey found the counts mangled body sonny and a gaunt gray wolf hovering over it with bloodslavering jaws you can guess who the wolf was and folks do say that at every full moonbut sonny didnt you see or hear anythingnot a thing pop and say what became of the wolfor vasili oukranikovwhy son they killed itfilled it full of lead and buried it in the house and then burned the place downyou know all this was sixty years ago when i was a little shaver but i remember it as if twas yesterdayi turned away with a shrug of my shoulders it was all so quaint and silly and artificial in the full light of day but sometimes when i am alone after dark in waste places and hear the demon echoes of those screams and snarls and that detestable crunching of bones i shudder again at the memory of that eldritch night,1
translated by elizabeth neville berkeley and lewis theobald junintroductory note the following very singular narrative or record of impressions was discovered under circumstances so extraordinary that they deserve careful description on the evening of wednesday august 27 1913 at about 830 oclock the population of the small seaside village of potowonket maine usa was aroused by a thunderous report accompanied by a blinding flash and persons near the shore beheld a mammoth ball of fire dart from the heavens into the sea but a short distance out sending up a prodigious column of water the following sunday a fishing party composed of john richmond peter b carr and simon canfield caught in their trawl and dragged ashore a mass of metallic rock weighing 360 pounds and looking as mr canfield said like a piece of slag most of the inhabitants agreed that this heavy body was none other than the fireball which had fallen from the sky four days before and dr richmond m jones the local scientific authority allowed that it must be an aerolite or meteoric stone in chipping off specimens to send to an expert boston analyst dr jones discovered imbedded in the semimetallic mass the strange book containing the ensuing tale which is still in his possessionin form the discovery resembles an ordinary notebook about 5 3 inches in size and containing thirty leaves in material however it presents marked peculiarities the covers are apparently of some dark stony substance unknown to geologists and unbreakable by any mechanical means no chemical reagent seems to act upon them the leaves are much the same save that they are lighter in colour and so infinitely thin as to be quite flexible the whole is bound by some process not very clear to those who have observed it a process involving the adhesion of the leaf substance to the cover substance these substances cannot now be separated nor can the leaves be torn by any amount of force the writing isgreek of the purest classical qualityand several students of palaeography declare that the characters are in a cursive hand used about the second century b c there is little in the text to determine the date the mechanical mode of writing cannot be deduced beyond the fact that it must have resembled that of the modern slate and slatepencil during the course of analytical efforts made by the late prof chambers of harvard several pages mostly at the conclusion of the narrative were blurred to the point of utter effacement before being read a circumstance forming a wellnigh irreparable loss what remains of the contents was done into modern greek letters by the palaeographer rutherford and in this form submitted to the translatorsprof mayfield of the massachusetts institute of technology who examined samples of the strange stone declares it a true meteorite an opinion in which dr von winterfeldt of heidelberg interned in 1918 as a dangerous enemy alien does not concur prof bradley of columbia college adopts a less dogmatic ground pointing out that certain utterly unknown ingredients are present in large quantities and warning that no classification is as yet possiblethe presence nature and message of the strange book form so momentous a problem that no explanation can even be attempted the text as far as preserved is here rendered as literally as our language permits in the hope that some reader may eventually hit upon an interpretation and solve one of the greatest scientific mysteries of recent yearsenblt junthe storyit was a narrow place and i was alone on one side beyond a margin of vivid waving green was the sea blue bright and billowy and sending up vaporous exhalations which intoxicated me so profuse indeed were these exhalations that they gave me an odd impression of a coalescence of sea and sky for the heavens were likewise bright and blue on the other side was the forest ancient almost as the sea itself and stretching infinitely inland it was very dark for the trees were grotesquely huge and luxuriant and incredibly numerous their giant trunks were of a horrible green which blended weirdly with the narrow green tract whereon i stood at some distance away on either side of me the strange forest extended down to the waters edge obliterating the shore line and completely hemming in the narrow tract some of the trees i observed stood in the water itself as though impatient of any barrier to their progressi saw no living thing nor sign that any living thing save myself had ever existed the sea and the sky and the wood encircled me and reached off into regions beyond my imagination nor was there any sound save of the windtossed wood and of the seaas i stood in this silent place i suddenly commenced to tremble for though i knew not how i came there and could scarce remember what my name and rank had been i felt that i should go mad if i could understand what lurked about me i recalled things i had learned things i had dreamed things i had imagined and yearned for in some other distant life i thought of long nights when i had gazed up at the stars of heaven and cursed the gods that my free soul could not traverse the vast abysses which were inaccessible to my body i conjured up ancient blasphemies and terrible delvings into the papyri of democritus but as memories appeared i shuddered in deeper fear for i knew that i was alonehorribly alone alone yet close to sentient impulses of vast vague kind which i prayed never to comprehend nor encounter in the voice of the swaying green branches i fancied i could detect a kind of malignant hatred and daemoniac triumph sometimes they struck me as being in horrible colloquy with ghastly and unthinkable things which the scaly green bodies of the trees half hid hid from sight but not from consciousness the most oppressive of my sensations was a sinister feeling of alienage though i saw about me objects which i could nametrees grass sea and sky i felt that their relation to me was not the same as that of the trees grass sea and sky i knew in another and dimly remembered life the nature of the difference i could not tell yet i shook in stark fright as it impressed itself upon meand then in a spot where i had before discerned nothing but the misty sea i beheld the green meadow separated from me by a vast expanse of blue rippling water with suntipped wavelets yet strangely near often i would peep fearfully over my right shoulder at the trees but i preferred to look at the green meadow which affected me oddlyit was while my eyes were fixed upon this singular tract that i first felt the ground in motion beneath me beginning with a kind of throbbing agitation which held a fiendish suggestion of conscious action the bit of bank on which i stood detached itself from the grassy shore and commenced to float away borne slowly onward as if by some current of resistless force i did not move astonished and startled as i was by the unprecedented phenomenon but stood rigidly still until a wide lane of water yawned betwixt me and the land of trees then i sat down in a sort of daze and again looked at the suntipped water and the green meadowbehind me the trees and the things they may have been hiding seemed to radiate infinite menace this i knew without turning to view them for as i grew more used to the scene i became less and less dependent upon the five senses that once had been my sole reliance i knew the green scaly forest hated me yet now i was safe from it for my bit of bank had drifted far from the shorebut though one peril was past another loomed up before me pieces of earth were constantly crumbling from the floating isle which held me so that death could not be far distant in any event yet even then i seemed to sense that death would be death to me no more for i turned again to watch the green meadow imbued with a curious feeling of security in strange contrast to my general horrorthen it was that i heard at a distance immeasurable the sound of falling water not that of any trivial cascade such as i had known but that which might be heard in the far scythian lands if all the mediterranean were poured down an unfathomable abyss it was toward this sound that my shrinking island was drifting yet i was contentfar in the rear were happening weird and terrible things things which i turned to view yet shivered to behold for in the sky dark vaporous forms hovered fantastically brooding over trees and seeming to answer the challenge of the waving green branches then a thick mist arose from the sea to join the skyforms and the shore was erased from my sight though the sunwhat sun i knew notshone brightly on the water around me the land i had left seemed involved in a daemoniac tempest where clashed the will of the hellish trees and what they hid with that of the sky and the sea and when the mist vanished i saw only the blue sky and the blue sea for the land and the trees were no moreit was at this point that my attention was arrested by thesingingin the green meadow hitherto as i have said i had encountered no sign of human life but now there arose to my ears a dull chant whose origin and nature were apparently unmistakable while the words were utterly undistinguishable the chant awaked in me a peculiar train of associations and i was reminded of some vaguely disquieting lines i had once translated out of an egyptian book which in turn were taken from a papyrus of ancient mero through my brain ran lines that i fear to repeat lines telling of very antique things and forms of life in the days when our earth was exceeding young of things which thought and moved and were alive yet which gods and men would not consider alive it was a strange bookas i listened i became gradually conscious of a circumstance which had before puzzled me only subconsciously at no time had my sight distinguished any definite objects in the green meadow an impression of vivid homogeneous verdure being the sum total of my perception now however i saw that the current would cause my island to pass the shore at but a little distance so that i might learn more of the land and of the singing thereon my curiosity to behold the singers had mounted high though it was mingled with apprehensionbits of sod continued to break away from the tiny tract which carried me but i heeded not their loss for i felt that i was not to die with the body or appearance of a body which i seemed to possess that everything about me even life and death was illusory that i had overleaped the bounds of mortality and corporeal entity becoming a free detached thing impressed me as almost certain of my location i knew nothing save that i felt i could not be on the earthplanet once so familiar to me my sensations apart from a kind of haunting terror were those of a traveller just embarked upon an unending voyage of discovery for a moment i thought of the lands and persons i had left behind and of strange ways whereby i might some day tell them of my adventurings even though i might never returni had now floated very near the green meadow so that the voices were clear and distinct but though i knew many languages i could not quite interpret the words of the chanting familiar they indeed were as i had subtly felt when at a greater distance but beyond a sensation of vague and awesome remembrance i could make nothing of them a most extraordinaryqualityin the voicesa quality which i cannot describeat once frightened and fascinated me my eyes could now discern several things amidst the omnipresent verdurerocks covered with bright green moss shrubs of considerable height and less definable shapes of great magnitude which seemed to move or vibrate amidst the shrubbery in a peculiar way the chanting whose authors i was so anxious to glimpse seemed loudest at points where these shapes were most numerous and most vigorously in motionand then as my island drifted closer and the sound of the

dedicated to robert blochi have seen the dark universe yawningwhere the black planets roll without aimwhere they roll in their horror unheededwithout knowledge or lustre or namenemesiscautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that robert blake was killed by lightning or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge it is true that the window he faced was unbroken but nature has shewn herself capable of many freakish performances the expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered as for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church on federal hillthe shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry conscious or unconscious with at least some of which blake was secretly connectedfor after all the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth dream terror and superstition and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre spectral sort his earlier stay in the citya visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as hehad ended amidst death and flame and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in milwaukee he may have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflectionamong those however who have examined and correlated all this evidence there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories they are inclined to take much of blakes diary at its face value and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox starry wisdom sect prior to 1877 the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named edwin m lillibridge in 1893 andabove allthe look of monstrous transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died it was one of these believers who moved to fanatical extremes threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box found in the old church steeplethe black windowless steeple and not the tower where blakes diary said those things originally were though widely censured both officially and unofficially this mana reputable physician with a taste for odd folkloreaverred that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon itbetween these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself the papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle leaving for others the drawing of the picture as robert blake saw itor thought he saw itor pretended to see it now studying the diary closely dispassionately and at leisure let us summarise the dark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief actoryoung blake returned to providence in the winter of 19345 taking the upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off college streeton the crest of the great eastward hill near the brown university campus and behind the marble john hay library it was a cosy and fascinating place in a little garden oasis of villagelike antiquity where huge friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient shed the square georgian house had a monitor roof classic doorway with fan carving smallpaned windows and all the other earmarks of early nineteenthcentury workmanship inside were sixpanelled doors wide floorboards a curving colonial staircase white adamperiod mantels and a rear set of rooms three steps below the general levelblakes study a large southwest chamber overlooked the front garden on one side while its west windowsbefore one of which he had his deskfaced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower towns outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them on the far horizon were the open countrysides purple slopes against these some two miles away rose the spectral hump of federal hill bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them blake had a curious sense that he was looking upon some unknown ethereal world which might or might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in personhaving sent home for most of his books blake bought some antique furniture suitable to his quarters and settled down to write and paintliving alone and attending to the simple housework himself his studio was in a north attic room where the panes of the monitor roof furnished admirable lighting during that first winter he produced five of his bestknown short storiesthe burrower beneath the stairs in the crypt shaggai in the vale of pnath and the feaster from the starsand painted seven canvases studies of nameless unhuman monsters and profoundly alien nonterrestrial landscapesat sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread westthe dark towers of memorial hall just below the georgian courthouse belfry the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section and that shimmering spirecrowned mound in the distance whose unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy from his few local acquaintances he learned that the faroff slope was a vast italian quarter though most of the houses were remnants of older yankee and irish days now and then he would train his fieldglasses on that spectral unreachable world beyond the curling smoke picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house even with optical aid federal hill seemed somehow alien half fabulous and linked to the unreal intangible marvels of blakes own tales and pictures the feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into the violet lampstarred twilight and the courthouse floodlights and the red industrial trust beacon had blazed up to make the night grotesqueof all the distant objects on federal hill a certain huge dark church most fascinated blake it stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky it seemed to rest on especially high ground for the grimy facade and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and chimneypots peculiarly grim and austere it appeared to be built of stone stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more the style so far as the glass could shew was that earliest experimental form of gothic revival which preceded the stately upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the georgian age perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815as months passed blake watched the faroff forbidding structure with an oddly mounting interest since the vast windows were never lighted he knew that it must be vacant the longer he watched the more his imagination worked till at length he began to fancy curious things he believed that a vague singular aura of desolation hovered over the place so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of birds but here they never rested at least that is what he thought and set down in his diary he pointed the place out to several friends but none of them had even been on federal hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was or had beenin the spring a deep restlessness gripped blake he had begun his longplanned novelbased on a supposed survival of the witchcult in mainebut was strangely unable to make progress with it more and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black frowning steeple shunned by the birds when the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty but blakes restlessness was merely increased it was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that fabulous slope into the smokewreathed world of dreamlate in april just before the aeonshadowed walpurgis time blake made his first trip into the unknown plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak decayed squares beyond he came finally upon the ascending avenue of centuryworn steps sagging doric porches and blearpaned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the longknown unreachable world beyond the mists there were dingy blueandwhite street signs which meant nothing to him and presently he noted the strange dark faces of the drifting crowds and the foreign signs over curious shops in brown decadeweathered buildings nowhere could he find any of the objects he had seen from afar so that once more he half fancied that the federal hill of that distant view was a dreamworld never to be trod by living human feetnow and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight but never the blackened pile that he sought when he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head though he spoke english freely as blake climbed higher the region seemed stranger and stranger with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south he crossed two or three broad avenues and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned the dark mans face had a look of fear which he tried to hide and blake saw him make a curious sign with his right handthen suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys blake knew at once what it was and plunged toward it through the squalid unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue twice he lost his way but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanesat last he saw the tower plain against the southwest and a huge stone bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley presently he stood in a windswept open square quaintly cobblestoned with a high bank wall on the farther side this was the end of his quest for upon the wide ironrailed weedgrown plateau which the wall supporteda separate lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streetsthere stood a grim titan bulk whose identity despite blakes new perspective was beyond disputethe vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude some of the high stone buttresses had fallen and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown neglected weeds and grasses the sooty gothic windows were largely unbroken though many of the stone mullions were missing blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so well in view of the known habits of small boys the world over the massive doors were intact and tightly closed around the top of the bank wall fully enclosing the grounds was a rusty iron fence whose gateat the head of a flight of steps from the squarewas visibly padlocked the path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place and in the birdless eaves and black ivyless walls blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to definethere were very few people in the square but blake saw a policeman at the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church he was a great wholesome irishman and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that building when blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the italian priests warned everybody against it vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark he himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father who recalled certain sounds and rumours from his boyhoodthere had been a bad sect there in the ould daysan outlaw sect that called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night it had taken a good priest to exorcise what had come though there did be those who said that merely the light could do it if father omalley were alive there would be many the thing he could tell but now there was nothing to do but let it alone it hurt nobody now and those that owned it were dead or far away they had run away like rats after the threatening talk in 77 when people began to mind the way folks vanished now and then in the neighbourhood some day the city would step in and take the property for lack of heirs but little good would come of anybodys touching it better it be left alone for the years to topple lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyssafter the policeman had gone blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile it excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated probably they were mere legends evoked by the evil look of the place but even so they were like a strange coming to life of one of his own storiesthe afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds but seemed unable to light up the stained sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high plateau it was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown withered growths in the raised ironfenced yard blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress there was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be resisted the fence had no opening near the steps but around on the north side were some missing bars he could go up the steps and walk around on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap if the people feared the place so wildly he would encounter no interferencehe was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him then looking down he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made several windows were slammed down and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety unpainted house the gap in the fence was very easy to pass through and before long blake found himself wading amidst the rotting tangled growths of the deserted yard here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in this field but that he saw must have been very long ago the sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the facade all were securely locked so he began a circuit of the cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on automaticallya yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture peering in blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western suns filtered rays debris old barrels and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines the rusted remains of a hotair furnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as midvictorian timesacting almost without conscious initiative blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dustcarpeted and debrisstrown concrete floor the vaulted cellar was a vast one without partitions and in a corner far to the right amid dense shadows he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs he felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted aboutfinding a stillintact barrel amid the dust and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit then bracing himself he crossed the wide cobwebfestooned space toward the arch half choked with the omnipresent dust and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness he had no light but groped carefully with his hands after a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead and a little fumbling revealed its ancient latch it opened inward and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with wormeaten panellingonce on the ground floor blake began exploring in a rapid fashion all the inner doors were unlocked so that he freely passed from room to room the colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews altar hourglass pulpit and soundingboard and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered gothic columns over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange halfblackened panes of the great apsidal windowsthe paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that blake could scarcely decipher what they had represented but from the little he could make out he did not like them the designs were largely conventional and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancient patterns the few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism while one of the windows seemed to shew merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity scattered about in it turning away from the windows blake noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy egyptin a rear vestry room beside the apse blake found a rotting desk and ceilinghigh shelves of mildewed disintegrating books here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror for the titles of those books told him much they were the black forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of or have heard of only in furtive timorous whispers the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of mans youth and the dim fabulous days before man was he had himself read many of thema latin version of the abhorrednecronomiconthe sinisterliber ivonisthe infamouscultes des goulesof comte derlette theunaussprechlichen kultenof von

unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult student clearly the lingering local rumours had not lied this place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universein the ruined desk was a small leatherbound recordbook filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium the manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy astrology and other dubious artsthe devices of the sun moon planets aspects and zodiacal signshere massed in solid pages of text with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letterin the hope of later solving the cryptogram blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time he wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long was he the first to conquer the clutching pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitorshaving now thoroughly explored the ground floor blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steepleobjects so long familiar to him at a distance the ascent was a choking experience for dust lay thick while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place the staircase was a spiral with high narrow wooden treads and now and then blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city though he had seen no ropes below he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow louverboarded lancet windows his fieldglass had studied so often here he was doomed to disappointment for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes and clearly devoted to vastly different purposesthe room about fifteen feet square was faintly lighted by four lancet windows one on each side which were glazed within their screening of decayed louverboards these had been further fitted with tight opaque screens but the latter were now largely rotted away in the centre of the dustladen floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in average diameter covered on each side with bizarre crudely incised and wholly unrecognisable hieroglyphs on this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form its hinged lid thrown back and its interior holding what looked beneath the decadedeep dust to be an eggshaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through around the pillar in a rough circle were seven highbacked gothic chairs still largely intact while behind them ranging along the darkpanelled walls were seven colossal images of crumbling blackpainted plaster resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious easter island in one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall leading up to the closed trapdoor of the windowless steeple aboveas blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd basreliefs on the strange open box of yellowish metal approaching he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind depicting entities which though seemingly alive resembled no known lifeform ever evolved on this planet the fourinch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black redstriated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter it did not touch the bottom of the box but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre with seven queerly designed supports extending horizontally to angles of the boxs inner wall near the top this stone once exposed exerted upon blake an almost alarming fascination he could scarcely tear his eyes from it and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent with halfformed worlds of wonder within into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs with great stone towers and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and willwhen he did look away it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple just why it took his attention he could not tell but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind ploughing toward it and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went he began to discern something grim about it hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth and blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions it was a human skeleton and it must have been there for a very long time the clothing was in shreds but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a mans grey suit there were other bits of evidenceshoes metal clasps huge buttons for round cuffs a stickpin of bygone pattern a reporters badge with the name of the oldprovidence telegramand a crumbling leather pocketbook blake examined the latter with care finding within it several bills of antiquated issue a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893 some cards with the name edwin m lillibridge and a paper covered with pencilled memorandathis paper held much of a puzzling nature and blake read it carefully at the dim westward window its disjointed text included such phrases as the followingprof enoch bowen home from egypt may 1844buys old freewill church in julyhis archaeological work studies in occult well knowndr drowne of 4th baptist warns

blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust the implications of the notes were clear and there could be no doubt but that this man had come to the deserted edifice fortytwo years before in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt perhaps no one else had known of his planwho could tell but he had never returned to his paper had some bravely suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heartfailure blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state some of them were badly scattered and a few seemed oddlydissolvedat the ends others were strangely yellowed with vague suggestions of charring this charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing the skull was in a very peculiar statestained yellow and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone what had happened to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here blake could not imaginebefore he realised it he was looking at the stone again and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind he saw processions of robed hooded figures whose outlines were not human and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved skyreaching monoliths he saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea and vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze and beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness where solid and semisolid forms were known only by their windy stirrings and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we knowthen all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing indeterminate panic fear blake choked and turned away from the stone conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness he felt entangled with somethingsomething which was not in the stone but which had looked through it at himsomething which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight plainly the place was getting on his nervesas well it might in view of his gruesome find the light was waning too and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soonit was then in the gathering twilight that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone he had tried to look away from it but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back was there a subtle phosphorescence of radioactivity about the thing what was it that the dead mans notes had said concerning ashining trapezohedronwhat anyway was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil what had been done here and what might still be lurking in the birdshunned shadows it seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by though its source was not apparent blake seized the cover of the longopen box and snapped it down it moved easily on its alien hinges and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stoneat the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeples eternal blackness overhead beyond the trapdoor rats without questionthe only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it and yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs across the ghoulish nave into the vaulted basement out amidst the gathering dusk of the deserted square and down through the teeming fearhaunted alleys and avenues of federal hill toward the sane central streets and the homelike brick sidewalks of the college districtduring the days which followed blake told no one of his expedition instead he read much in certain books examined long years of newspaper files downtown and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room the cipher he soon saw was no simple one and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be english latin greek french spanish italian or german evidently he would have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange eruditionevery evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned and he saw the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and halffabulous world but now it held a fresh note of terror for him he knew the heritage of evil lore it masked and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways the birds of spring were returning and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt lone spire as never before when a flock of them approached it he thought they would wheel and scatter in panic confusionand he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening milesit was in june that blakes diary told of his victory over the cryptogram the text was he found in the dark aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity and known to him in a halting way through previous researches the diary is strangely reticent about what blake deciphered but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results there are references to a haunter of the dark awaked by gazing into the shining trapezohedron and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called the being is spoken of as holding all knowledge and demanding monstrous sacrifices some of blakes entries shew fear lest the thing which he seemed to regard as summoned stalk abroad though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossedof the shining trapezohedron he speaks often calling it a window on all time and space and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark yuggoth before ever the old ones brought it to earth it was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of antarctica salvaged from their ruins by the serpentmen of valusia and peered at aeons later in lemuria by the first human beings it crossed strange lands and stranger seas and sank with atlantis before a minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted khem the pharaoh nephrenka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new pharaoh destroyed till the delvers spade once more brought it forth to curse mankindearly in july the newspapers oddly supplement blakes entries though in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution it appears that a new fear had been growing on federal hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church the italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams something they said was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth press items mentioned the longstanding local superstitions but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror it was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians in writing of these things in his diary blake expresses a curious kind of remorse and talks of the duty of burying the shining trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire at the same time however he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination and admits a morbid longingpervading even his dreamsto visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stonethen something in thejournalon the morning of july 17 threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror it was only a variant of the other halfhumorous items about the federal hill restlessness but to blake it was somehow very terrible indeed in the night a thunderstorm had put the citys lightingsystem out of commission for a full hour and in that black interval the italians had nearly gone mad with fright those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the streetlamps absence and gone down into the body of the church flopping and bumping around in a viscous altogether dreadful way toward the last it had bumped up to the tower where there were sounds of the shattering of glass it could go wherever the darkness reached but light would always send it fleeingwhen the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower for even the feeble light trickling through the grimeblackened louverboarded windows was too much for the thing it had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in timefor a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it during the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellasa guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness once those nearest the church declared the outer door had rattled hideouslybut even this was not the worst that evening in thebulletinblake read of what the reporters had found aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain they found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way with bits of rotted cushions and satin pewlinings scattered curiously around there was a bad odour everywhere and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches of what looked like charring opening the door to the tower and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly cleanin the tower itself a similarly halfswept condition existed they spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar the overturned gothic chairs and the bizarre plaster images though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned what disturbed blake the mostexcept for the hints of stains and charring and bad odourswas the final detail that explained the crashing glass every one of the towers lancet windows was broken and two of them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pewlinings and cushionhorsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior louverboards more satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor as if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained daysyellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless spire but when a reporter climbed up opened the horizontally sliding trapdoor and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space he saw nothing but darkness and an heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture the verdict of course was charlatanry somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hilldwellers or else some fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good or perhaps some of the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside world there was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports three men in succession found ways of evading the assignment and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reportersfrom this point onward blakes diary shews a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension he upbraids himself for not doing something and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown it has been verified that on three occasionsduring thunderstormshe telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken now and then his entries shew concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone and the strangely marred old skeleton when they explored the shadowy tower room he assumed that these things had been removedwhither and by whom or what he could only guess but his worst fears concerned himself and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeplethat monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces he seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of the west window at that faroff spirebristling mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city his entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep there is mention of a night when he awaked to find himself fully dressed outdoors and headed automatically down college hill toward the west again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find himthe week following july 30 is recalled as the time of blakes partial breakdown he did not dress and ordered all his food by telephone visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed and he said that sleepwalking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untyingin his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse after retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space all he could see were short faint horizontal streaks of bluish light but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft furtive sounds above him whenever he moved he stumbled over something and at each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from abovea vague stirring mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on woodonce his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall and fumbling his uncertain way upward toward some region of intenser stench where a hot searing blast beat down against him before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness he thought of the ancient legends of ultimate chaos at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god azathoth lord of all things encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a daemoniac flute held in nameless pawsthen a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the unutterable horror of his position what it was he never knewperhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on federal hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints or the saints of their native villages in italy in any event he shrieked aloud dropped frantically from the ladder and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed himhe knew instantly where he was and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase tripping and bruising himself at every turn there was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow a sightless scramble through a littered basement a climb to regions of air and streetlights outside and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables across a grim silent city of tall black towers and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient dooron regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed dirt and cobwebs covered him and every inch of his body seemed sore and bruised when he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing it was then that his nerves broke down thereafter lounging exhaustedly about in a dressinggown he did little but stare from his west window shiver at the threat of thunder and make wild entries in his diarythe great storm broke just before midnight on august 8th lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city and two remarkable fireballs were reported the rain was torrential while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system and tried to telephone the company around 1 am though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety he recorded everything in his diarythe large nervous and often undecipherable hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair and of entries scrawled blindly in the darkhe had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window and it appears that most of his time was spent at his desk peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking federal hill now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary so that detached phrases such as the lights must not go it knows where i am i must destroy it and it is calling to me but perhaps it means no injury this time are found scattered down two of the pagesthen the lights went out all over the city it happened at 212 am according to powerhouse records but blakes diary gives no indication of the time the entry is merely lights outgod help me on federal hill there were watchers as anxious as he and rainsoaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrellashaded candles electric flashlights oil lanterns crucifixes and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern italy they blessed each flash of lightning and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether a rising wind blew out most of the candles so that the scene grew threateningly dark someone roused father merluzzo of spirito santo church and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower there could be no doubt whateverfor what happened at 235 we have the testimony of the priest a young intelligent and welleducated person of patrolman william j monahan of the central station an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd and of most of the seventyeight men who had gathered around the churchs high bank wallespecially those in the square where the eastward facade was visible of course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of nature the possible causes of such an event are many no one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast ancient illaired and longdeserted building of heterogeneous contents mephitic vapoursspontaneous combustionpressure of gases born of long decayany one of numberless phenomena might be responsible and then of course the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded the thing was really quite simple in itself and covered less than three minutes of actual time father merluzzo always a precise man looked at his watch repeatedlyit started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower there had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange evil odours from the church and this had now become emphatic and offensive then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a large heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade the tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the smokegrimed louverboarding of that towers east windowimmediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights choking and sickening the trembling watchers and almost prostrating those in the square at the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings and a sudden eastblowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas of the crowd nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night though some upwardlooking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky skysomething like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed toward the eastthat was all the watchers were half numbed with fright awe and discomfort and scarcely knew what to do or whether to do anything at all not knowing what had happened they did not relax their vigil and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning followed by an earsplitting crash of sound rent the flooded heavens half an hour later the rain stopped and in fifteen minutes more the streetlights sprang on again sending the weary bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homesthe next days papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with the general storm reports it seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the federal hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed the phenomenon was most marked over college hill where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens it was agreed that the lone sudden lightningbolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood though no trace of its striking could afterward be found a youth in the tau omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst but his observation has not been verified all of the few observers however agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally generalthese points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connexion with the death of robert blake students in the psi delta house whose upper rear windows looked into blakes study noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the 9th and wondered what was wrong with the expression when they saw the same face in the same position that evening they felt worried and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment later they rang the bell of the darkened flat and finally had a policeman force the doorthe rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window and when the intruders saw the glassy bulging eyes and the marks of stark convulsive fright on the twisted features they turned away in sickened dismay shortly afterward the coroners physician made an examination and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge as the cause of death the hideous expression he ignored altogether deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions he deduced these latter qualities from the books paintings and manuscripts found in the apartment and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last and the brokenpointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right handthe entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed and legible only in part from them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative the case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious dr dexter who threw the curious box and angled stonean object certainly selfluminous as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was foundinto the deepest channel of narragansett bay excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on blakes part aggravated by

i saw him on a sleepless night when i was walking desperately to save my soul and my vision my coming to new york had been a mistake for whereas i had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten and in the cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly babylonian under waning moons i had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master paralyse and annihilate methe disillusion had been gradual coming for the first time upon the town i had seen it in the sunset from a bridge majestic above its waters its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming golden clouds and the first stars of evening then it had lighted up window by window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies and itself become a starry firmament of dream redolent of faery music and one with the marvels of carcassonne and samarcand and el dorado and all glorious and halffabulous cities shortly afterward i was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancynarrow curving alleys and passages where rows of red georgian brick blinked with smallpaned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coachesand in the first flush of realisation of these longwished things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poetbut success and happiness were not to be garish daylight shewed only squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic and the throngs of people that seethed through the flumelike streets were squat swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes about them who could never mean aught to a blueeyed man of the old folk with the love of fair green lanes and white new england village steeples in his heartso instead of the poems i had hoped for there came only a shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness and i saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe beforethe unwhisperable secret of secretsthe fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of old new york as london is of old london and paris of old paris but that it is in fact quite dead its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life upon making this discovery i ceased to sleep comfortably though something of resigned tranquillity came back as i gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraithlike about and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them with this mode of relief i even wrote a few poems and still refrained from going home to my people lest i seem to crawl back ignobly in defeatthen on a sleepless nights walk i met the man it was in a grotesque hidden courtyard of the greenwich section for there in my ignorance i had settled having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists the archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted me and when i found the poets and artists to be loudvoiced pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art i stayed on for love of these venerable things i fancied them as they were in their prime when greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town and in the hours before dawn when all the revellers had slunk away i used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited there this kept my soul alive and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for which the poet far within me cried outthe man came upon me at about two one cloudy august morning as i was threading a series of detached courtyards now accessible only through the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings but once forming parts of a continuous network of picturesque alleys i had heard of them by vague rumour and realised that they could not be upon any map of today but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me so that i had sought them with twice my usual eagerness now that i had found them my eagerness was again redoubled for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such with dark dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements or lurking lamplessly behind archways unbetrayed by hordes of the foreignspeaking or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practices do not invite publicity or the light of dayhe spoke to me without invitation noting my mood and glances as i studied certain knockered doorways above ironrailed steps the pallid glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face his own face was in shadow and he wore a widebrimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the outofdate cloak he affected but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me his form was very slight thin almost to cadaverousness and his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow though not particularly deep he had he said noticed me several times at my wanderings and inferred that i resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years would i not like the guidance of one long practiced in these explorations and possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly have gainedas he spoke i caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window it was a noble even a handsome elderly countenance and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for the age and place yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased meperhaps it was too white or too expressionless or too much out of keeping with the locality to make me feel easy or comfortable nevertheless i followed him for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive and i reckoned it a rare favour of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than minesomething in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick walls and once crawled on hands and knees through a low arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location i had managed to preserve the things we saw were very old and marvellous or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urnheaded iron fenceposts and flaringlintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquitywe met no person and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer the streetlights we first encountered had been of oil and of the ancient lozenge pattern later i noticed some with candles and at last after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooden gate in a high wall we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh houseunbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides this alley led steeply uphillmore steeply than i thought possible in this part of new yorkand the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivyclad wall of a private estate beyond which i could see a pale cupola and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky in this wall was a small lowarched gate of nailstudded black oak which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key leading me within he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house which he unlocked and opened for mewe entered and as we did so i grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay my host appeared not to notice this and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway across a hall and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us then i saw him pull the curtains of the three smallpaned windows that barely shewed themselves against the lightening sky after which he crossed to the mantel struck flint and steel lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces and made a gesture enjoining softtoned speechin this feeble radiance i saw that we were in a spacious wellfurnished and panelled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century with splendid doorway pediments a delightful doric cornice and a magnificently carved overmantel with scrollandurn top above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were wellwrought family portraits all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful chippendale table before seating himself across the table from me my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment then tardily removing his gloves widebrimmed hat and cloak stood theatrically revealed in full midgeorgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to kneebreeches silk hose and the buckled shoes i had not previously noticed now slowly sinking into a lyreback chair he commenced to eye me intentlywithout his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before and i wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my original disquiet when he spoke at length his soft hollow and carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered and now and then i had great difficulty in following him as i listened with a thrill of amazement and halfdisavowed alarm which grew each instantyou behold sir my host began a man of very eccentrical habits for whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations reflecting upon better times i have not scrupled to ascertain their ways and adopt their dress and manners an indulgence which offends none if practiced without ostentation it hath been my goodfortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors swallowed though it was by two towns first greenwich which built up hither after 1800 then newyork which joined on near 1830 there were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family and i have not been remiss in discharging such obligations the squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding some curious effects of these arts and discoveries i now purpose to shew you under the strictest secrecy and i believe i may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelityhe paused but i could only nod my head i have said that i was alarmed yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of new york and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts i had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer so i listenedtomy ancestor he softly continued there appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind qualities having a littlesuspected dominance not only over the acts of ones self and of others but over every variety of force and substance in nature and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than nature herself may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain halfbreed red indians once encamped upon this hill these indians shewed choler when the place was built and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon for years they stole over the wall each month when they could and by stealth performed sartain acts then in 68 the new squire catched them at their doings and stood still at what he saw thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old dutchman in the time of the statesgeneral and pox on him im afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rumwhether or not by intentfor a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it you sir are the first outsider to be told there is a secret and split me if id have risked tampering that much withthe powershad ye not been so hot after bygone thingsi shuddered as the man grew colloquialand with familiar speech of another day he went onbut you must know sir that whatthe squiregot from those mongrel salvages was but a small part of the larning he came to have he had not been at oxford for nothing nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in paris he was in fine made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects past the bidding of the vulgar but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco what we want we may make about us and what we dont want we may sweep away i wont say that all this is wholly true in body but tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then you i conceive would be tickled by a better sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you so be pleased to hold back any fright at what i design to shew come to the window and be quietmy host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold his flesh though dry and firm was of the quality of ice and i almost shrank away from his pulling but again i thought of the emptiness and horror of reality and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever i might be led once at the window the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into the blackness outside for a moment i saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights far far before me then as if in response to an insidious motion of my hosts hand a flash of heatlightning played over the scene and i looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliagefoliage unpolluted and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind on my right the hudson glittered wickedly and in the distance ahead i saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies the flash died and an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancerthat was before my timebefore the new squires time pray let us try againi was faint even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had made megood god i whispered can you do that forany timeand as he nodded and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs i clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling but he steadied me with that terrible icecold claw and once more made his insidious gestureagain the lightning flashedbut this time upon a scene not wholly strange it was greenwich the greenwich that used to be with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it now yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy common the marsh still glittered beyond but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york trinity and st pauls and the brick church dominating their sisters and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole i breathed hard but not so much from the sight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured upcan youdare yougofari spoke with awe and i think he shared it for a second but the evil grin returnedfarwhat i have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone back backforwardforwardlook ye puling lackwitand as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before for full three seconds i could glimpse that pandaemoniac sight and in those seconds i saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams i saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon and devillights burning from unnumbered windows and swarming loathsomely on arial galleries i saw the yellow squinteyed people of that city robed horribly in orange and red and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettledrums the clatter of obscene crotala and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed ocean of bitumeni saw this vista i say and heard as with the minds ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpsecity had ever stirred in my soul and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about methen as the flash subsided i saw that my host was trembling too a look of shocking fear half blotting from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited he tottered clutched at the curtains as i had done before and wriggled his head wildly like a hunted animal god knows he had cause for as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious it was the steady stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door as with the ascent of a barefoot or skinshod horde and at last the cautious purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight the old man clawed and spat at me through the mouldy air and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutchedthe full moondamn yeye ye yelping dogye called em and theyve come for me moccasined feetdead mengad sink ye ye red devils but i poisoned no rum o yourshant i kept your poxrotted magic safeye swilled yourselves sick curse ye and ye must needs blame the squirelet go you unhand that latchive naught for ye hereat this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician his fright turning to steely despair left room for a resurgence of his rage against me and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge i was steadying myself the curtains still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged in those greenish beams the candles paled and a new semblance of decay spread over the muskreeking room with its wormy panelling sagging floor battered mantel rickety furniture and ragged draperies it spread over the old man too whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence and i saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons only his eyes stayed whole and they glared with a propulsive dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindledthe rapping was now repeated with greater insistence and this time bore a hint of metal the black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels and i saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood i did not move for i could not but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining malevolent eyes it poured thickly like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead overturned a chair as it spread and finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me around that head it closed totally swallowing it up and in another moment it had begun to recede bearing away its invisible burden without touching me and flowing again out of that black doorway and down the unseen stairs which creaked as before though in reverse orderthen the floor gave way at last and i slid gaspingly down into the nighted chamber below choking with cobwebs and half swooning with terror the green moon shining through broken windows shewed me the hall door half open and as i rose from the plasterstrown floor and twisted myself free from the sagged ceilings i saw sweep past it an awful torrent of blackness with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it it was seeking the door to the cellar and when it found it it vanished therein i now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done and once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window of something which must have been the cupola now liberated for the instant from the wreckage i rushed through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open it seized a chair and broke a window climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moonlight danced over yardhigh grass and weeds the wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of boxes in a corner i managed to gain the top and cling to the great stone urn set thereabout me in my exhaustion i could see only strange walls and windows and old gambrel roofs the steep street of my approach was nowhere visible and the little i did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight suddenly the urn to which i clung began to tremble as if sharing my own lethal dizziness and in another instant my body was plunging downward to i knew not what fatethe man who found me said that i must have crawled a long way despite my broken bones for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look the gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal and reports could state no more than that i had appeared from a place unknown at the entrance of a little black court off perry streeti never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths nor would i direct any sane man thither if i could of who or what that ancient creature was i have no idea but i repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors whitherhehas gone i do not know but i have gone home to the pure new england lanes up which fragrant seawinds sweep at evening,1
i from the darkof herbert west who was my friend in college and in after life i can speak only with extreme terror this terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance but was engendered by the whole nature of his lifework and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago when we were in the third year of our course at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham while he was with me the wonder and diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly and i was his closest companion now that he is gone and the spell is broken the actual fear is greater memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realitiesthe first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock i ever experienced and it is only with reluctance that i repeat it as i have said it happened when we were in the medical school where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially his views which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and his fellowstudents hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes in his experiments with various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits guineapigs cats dogs and monkeys till he had become the prime nuisance of the college several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead in many cases violent signs but he soon saw that the perfection of this process if indeed possible would necessarily involve a lifetime of research it likewise became clear that since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress it was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himselfthe learned and benevolent dr allan halsey whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of arkhami had always been exceptionally tolerant of wests pursuits and we frequently discussed his theories whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process and that the socalled soul is a myth my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues and that unless actual decomposition has set in a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive braincells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause west fully realised it had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial lifemotions were incompatible he then sought extreme freshness in his specimens injecting his solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life it was this circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case they did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoninglyit was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that west confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly to hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves whenever the morgue proved inadequate two local negroes attended to this matter and they were seldom questioned west was then a small slender spectacled youth with delicate features yellow hair pale blue eyes and a soft voice and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potters field we finally decided on the potters field because practically every body in christchurch was embalmed a thing of course ruinous to wests researchesi was by this time his active and enthralled assistant and helped him make all his decisions not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work it was i who thought of the deserted chapman farmhouse beyond meadow hill where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings the place was far from any road and in sight of no other house yet precautions were none the less necessary since rumours of strange lights started by chance nocturnal roamers would soon bring disaster on our enterprise it was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in boston or quietly borrowed from the collegematerials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyesand provided spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar at the college we used an incinerator but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory bodies were always a nuisanceeven the small guineapig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in wests room at the boardinghousewe followed the local deathnotices like ghouls for our specimens demanded particular qualities what we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation preferably free from malforming disease and certainly with all organs present accident victims were our best hope not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities ostensibly in the colleges interest as often as we could without exciting suspicion we found that the college had first choice in every case so that it might be necessary to remain in arkham during the summer when only the limited summerschool classes were held in the end though luck favoured us for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potters field a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in sumners pond and buried at the towns expense without delay or embalming that afternoon we found the new grave and determined to begin work soon after midnightit was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us we carried spades and oil dark lanterns for although electric torches were then manufactured they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today the process of unearthing was slow and sordidit might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientistsand we were glad when our spades struck wood when the pine box was fully uncovered west scrambled down and removed the lid dragging out and propping up the contents i reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance the affair made us rather nervous especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy but we managed to remove all traces of our visit when we had patted down the last shovelful of earth we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old chapman place beyond meadow hillon an improvised dissectingtable in the old farmhouse by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp the specimen was not very spectral looking it had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian typelargeframed greyeyed and brownhaireda sound animal without psychological subtleties and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort now with the eyes closed it looked more asleep than dead though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score we had at last what west had always longed fora real dead man of the ideal kind ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use the tension on our part became very great we knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration i myself still held some curious notions about the traditional soul of man and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead i wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres and what he could relate if fully restored to life but my wonder was not overwhelming since for the most part i shared the materialism of my friend he was calmer than i as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the bodys arm immediately binding the incision securelythe waiting was gruesome but west never faltered every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen and bore the negative results philosophically after about threequarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize we had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar and would have to fill it by dawnfor although we had fixed a lock on the house we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery besides the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical carethe awful event was very sudden and wholly unexpected i was pouring something from one testtube to another and west was busy over the alcohol blastlamp which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice when from the pitchblack room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned for in one inconceivable cacophony was centred all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature human it could not have beenit is not in man to make such soundsand without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery both west and i leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals overturning tubes lamp and retorts and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraintjust enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauchwe did not separate but managed to get to wests room where we whispered with the gas up until dawn by then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for investigation so that we could sleep through the dayclasses being disregarded but that evening two items in the paper wholly unrelated made it again impossible for us to sleep the old deserted chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes that we could understand because of the upset lamp also an attempt had been made to disturb a new grave in the potters field as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth that we could not understand for we had patted down the mould very carefullyand for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder and complain of fancied footsteps behind him now he has disappearedii the plaguedaemoni shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham it is by that satanic scourge that most recall the year for truly terror brooded with batwings over the piles of coffins in the tombs of christchurch cemetery yet for me there is a greater horror in that timea horror known to me alone now that herbert west has disappearedwest and i were doing postgraduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead after the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean dr allan halsey though west had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boardinghouse room and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its grave in the potters field to a deserted farmhouse beyond meadow hilli was with him on that odious occasion and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which he thought would to some extent restore lifes chemical and physical processes it had ended horriblyin a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nervesand west had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted the body had not been quite fresh enough it is obvious that to restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed and a burning of the old house had prevented us from burying the thing it would have been better if we could have known it was undergroundafter that experience west had dropped his researches for some time but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned he again became importunate with the college faculty pleading for the use of the dissectingroom and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important his pleas however were wholly in vain for the decision of dr halsey was inflexible and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader in the radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful enthusiast whose slight form yellow hair spectacled blue eyes and soft voice gave no hint of the supernormalalmost diabolicalpower of the cold brain within i can see him now as he was thenand i shiver he grew sterner of face but never elderly and now sefton asylum has had the mishap and west has vanishedwest clashed disagreeably with dr halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy he felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university that the traditionbound elders should ignore his singular results on animals and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of wests logical temperament only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the professordoctor typethe product of generations of pathetic puritanism kindly conscientious and sometimes gentle and amiable yet always narrow intolerant customridden and lacking in perspective age has more charity for these incomplete yet highsouled characters whose worst real vice is timidity and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sinssins like ptolemaism calvinism antidarwinism antinietzscheism and every sort of sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation west young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements had scant patience with good dr halsey and his erudite colleagues and nursed an increasing resentment coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion like most youths he indulged in elaborate daydreams of revenge triumph and final magnanimous forgivenessand then had come the scourge grinning and lethal from the nightmare caverns of tartarus west and i had graduated about the time of its beginning but had remained for additional work at the summer school so that we were in arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town though not as yet licenced physicians we now had our degrees and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew the situation was almost past management and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle burials without embalming were made in rapid succession and even the christchurch cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead this circumstance was not without effect on west who thought often of the irony of the situationso many fresh specimens yet none for his persecuted researches we were frightfully overworked and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidlybut wests gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties college had all but closed and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague dr halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service applying his extreme skill with wholehearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion west could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissectingroom one night and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution the thing actually opened its eyes but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soulpetrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it west said it was not fresh enoughthe hot summer air does not favour corpses that time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing and west doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratorythe peak of the epidemic was reached in august west and i were almost dead and dr halsey did die on the 14th the students all attended the hasty funeral on the 15th and bought an impressive wreath though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy arkham citizens and by the municipality itself it was almost a public affair for the dean had surely been a public benefactor after the entombment we were all somewhat depressed and spent the afternoon at the bar of the commercial house where west though shaken by the death of his chief opponent chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories most of the students went home or to various duties as the evening advanced but west persuaded me to aid him in making a night of it wests landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning with a third man between us and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather wellapparently this acidulous matron was right for about 3 am the whole house was aroused by cries coming from wests room where when they broke down the door they found the two of us unconscious on the bloodstained carpet beaten scratched and mauled and with the broken remnants of wests bottles and instruments around us only an open window told what had become of our assailant and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made there were some strange garments in the room but west upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases he ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace to the police we both declared ignorance of our late companions identity he was west nervously said a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location we had all been rather jovial and west and i did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted downthat same night saw the beginning of the second arkham horrorthe horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed the victim had been seen alive considerably after midnightthe dawn revealed the unutterable thing the manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of bolton was questioned but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate a fainter trail led away toward the woods but it soon gave outthe next night devils danced on the roofs of arkham and unnatural madness howled in the wind through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague and which some whispered was the embodied daemonsoul of the plague itself eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wakein all seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless sadistic monster that crept abroad a few persons had half seen it in the dark and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked for sometimes it had been hungry the number it had killed was fourteen three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been aliveon the third night frantic bands of searchers led by the police captured it in a house on crane street near the miskatonic campus they had organised the quest with care keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window the net was quickly spread on account of the general alarm and precautions there were only two more victims and the capture was effected without major casualties the thing was finally stopped by a bullet though not a fatal one and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathingfor it had been a man this much was clear despite the nauseous eyes the voiceless simianism and the daemoniac savagery they dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at sefton where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen yearsuntil the recent mishap when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention what had most disgusted the searchers of arkham was the thing they noticed when the monsters face was cleanedthe mocking unbelievable resemblance to a learned and selfsacrificing martyr who had been entombed but three days beforethe late dr allan halsey public benefactor and dean of the medical school of miskatonic universityto the vanished herbert west and to me the disgust and horror were supreme i shudder tonight as i think of it shudder even more than i did that morning when west muttered through his bandagesdamn it it wasntquitefresh enoughiii six shots by midnightit is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient but many things in the life of herbert west were uncommon it is for instance not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office yet that was the case with herbert west when he and i obtained our degrees at the medical school of miskatonic university and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated and as near as possible to the potters fieldreticence such as this is seldom without a cause nor indeed was ours for our requirements were those resulting from a lifework distinctly unpopular outwardly we were doctors only but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible momentfor the essence of herbert wests existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyards cold clay such a quest demands strange materials among them fresh human bodies and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal intermentwest and i had met in college and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant and now that we were out of college we had to keep together it was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in boltona factory town near arkham the seat of the college the bolton worsted mills are the largest in the miskatonic valley and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians we chose our house with the greatest care seizing at last on a rather rundown cottage near the end of pond street five numbers from the closest neighbour and separated from the local potters field by only a stretch of meadow land bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north the distance was greater than we wished but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field wholly out of the factory district we were not much displeased however since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies the walk was a trifle long but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbedour practice was surprisingly large from the very firstlarge enough to please most young doctors and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere the millhands were of somewhat turbulent inclinations and besides their many natural needs their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do but what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellarthe laboratory with the long table under the electric lights where in the small hours of the morning we often injected wests various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potters field west was experimenting madly to find something which would start mans vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles the solution had to be differently compounded for different typeswhat would serve for guineapigs would not serve for human beings and different human specimens required large modificationsthe bodies had to be exceedingly fresh or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible indeed the greatest problem was to get them fresh enoughwest had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage the results of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total failures and we both held fearsome recollections of such things ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on meadow hill in arkham we had felt a brooding menace and west though a calm blond blueeyed scientific automaton in most respects often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit he half felt that he was followeda psychological delusion of shaken nerves enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alivea frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at sefton then there was anotherour firstwhose exact fate we had never learnedwe had fair luck with specimens in boltonmuch better than in arkham we had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed it had lost an armif it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better between then and the next january we secured three more one total failure one case of marked muscular motion and one rather shivery thingit rose of itself and uttered a sound then came a period when luck was poor interments fell off and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use we kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic careone march night however we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potters field in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxingwith the usual result surreptitious and illconducted bouts among the millworkers were common and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported this late winter night there had been such a match evidently with disastrous results since two timorous poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case we followed them to an abandoned barn where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floorthe match had been between kid obriena lubberly and now quaking youth with a most unhibernian hooked noseand buck robinson the harlem smoke the negro had been knocked out and a moments examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so he was a loathsome gorillalike thing with abnormally long arms which i could not help calling fore legs and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable congo secrets and tomtom poundings under an eerie moon the body must have looked even worse in lifebut the world holds many ugly things fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up and they were grateful when west in spite of my involuntary shudders offered to get rid of the thing quietlyfor a purpose i knew too wellthere was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham we approached the house from the field in the rear took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs and prepared it for the usual experiment our fear of the police was absurdly great though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that sectionthe result was wearily anticlimactic ghastly as our prize appeared it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only so as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn we did as we had done with the othersdragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potters field and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish the grave was not very deep but fully as good as that of the previous specimenthe thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound in the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and densethe next day i was increasingly apprehensive about the police for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death west had still another source of worry for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly an italian woman had become hysterical over her missing childa lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinnerand had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart it was a very foolish hysteria for the boy had often run away before but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts about seven oclock in the evening she had died and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill west whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life friends had held him when he drew a stiletto but west departed amidst his inhuman shrieks curses and oaths of vengeance in his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have forgotten his child who was still missing as the night advanced there was some talk of searching the woods but most of the familys friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man altogether the nervous strain upon west must have been tremendous thoughts of the police and of the mad italian both weighed heavilywe retired about eleven but i did not sleep well bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town and i could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down it might mean the end of all our local workand perhaps prison for both west and me i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about after the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes but i turned over without rising to pull down the shade then came the steady rattling at the back doori lay still and somewhat dazed but before long heard wests rap on my door he was clad in dressinggown and slippers and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight from the revolver i knew that he was thinking more of the crazed italian than of the policewed better both go he whispered it wouldnt do not to answer it anyway and it may be a patientit would be like one of those fools to try the back doorso we both went down the stairs on tiptoe with a fear partly justified and partly that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours the rattling continued growing somewhat louder when we reached the door i cautiously unbolted it and threw it open and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there west did a peculiar thing despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigationa thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottagemy friend suddenly excitedly and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitorfor that visitor was neither italian nor policeman looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmaresa glassyeyed inkblack apparition nearly on all fours covered with bits of mould leaves and vines foul with caked blood and having between its glistening teeth a snowwhite terrible cylindrical object terminating in a tiny handiv the scream of the deadthe scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of dr herbert west which harassed the latter years of our companionship it is natural that such a thing as a dead mans scream should give horror for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence but i was used to similar experiences hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance and as i have implied it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraidherbert west whose associate and assistant i was possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician that was why when establishing his practice in bolton he had chosen an isolated house near the potters field briefly and brutally stated wests sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution for this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms scores of rabbits and guineapigs had been killed and treated but their trail was a blind one west had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh what he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life there was hope that this second and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection but we had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action to establish the artificial motion natural life must be extinctthe specimens must be very fresh but genuinely deadthe awesome quest had begun when west and i were students at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical nature of life that was seven years before but west looked scarcely a day older nowhe was small blond cleanshaven softvoiced and spectacled with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his terrible investigations our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme the results of defective reanimation when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid unnatural and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solutionone thing had uttered a nerveshattering scream another had risen violently beaten us both to unconsciousness and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind asylum bars still another a loathsome african monstrosity had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deedwest had had to shoot that object we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated so had perforce created nameless horrors it was disturbing to think that one perhaps two of our monsters still livedthat thought haunted us shadowingly till finally west disappeared under frightful circumstances but at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated bolton cottage our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens west was more avid than i so that it almost seemed to me that he looked halfcovetously at any very healthy living physiqueit was in july 1910 that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation he had he told me excitedly in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new anglethat of artificial preservation i had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound and was not surprised that it had turned out well but until he explained the details i was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them this i now saw west had clearly recognised creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the bolton prizefight at last fate had been kind so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun what would happen on reanimation and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason west did not venture to predict the experiment would be a landmark in our studies and he had saved the new body for my return so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashionwest told me how he had obtained the specimen it had been a vigorous man a welldressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the bolton worsted mills the walk through the town had been long and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories his heart had become greatly overtaxed he had refused a stimulant and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later the body as might be expected seemed to west a heavensent gift in his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in bolton and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one robert leavitt of st louis apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance if this man could not be restored to life no one would know of our experiment we buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the potters field if on the other hand he could be restored our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established so without delay west had injected into the bodys wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival the matter of the presumably weak heart which to my mind imperiled the success of our experiment did not appear to trouble west extensively he hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained beforea rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal living creatureso on the night of july 18 1910 herbert west and i stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white silent figure beneath the dazzling arclight the embalming compound had worked uncannily well for as i stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening i was moved to seek wests assurance that the thing was really dead this assurance he gave readily enough reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests as to life since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present as west proceeded to take preliminary steps i was impressed by the vast intricacy of the new experiment an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate than his own forbidding me to touch the body he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound this he said was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected slightly later when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs west stuffed a pillowlike object violently over the twitching face not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation the pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness withdrew satisfied and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days when our feats were new and groping i cannot express the wild breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimenthe first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abysswest was a materialist believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond deaths barrier i did not wholly disagree with him theoretically yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers so that i could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation besidesi could not extract from my memory that hideous inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at arkhamvery little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure a touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalkwhite and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard west who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist suddenly nodded significantly and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the bodys mouth there followed a few spasmodic muscular motions and then an audible breathing and visible motion of the chest i looked at the closed eyelids and thought i detected a quivering then the lids opened shewing eyes which were grey calm and alive but still unintelligent and not even curiousin a moment of fantastic whim i whispered questions to the reddening ears questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present subsequent terror drove them from my mind but i think the last one which i repeated was where have you been i do not yet know whether i was answered or not for no sound came from the wellshaped mouth but i do know that at that moment i firmly thought the thin lips moved silently forming syllables i would have vocalised as only now if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy at that moment as i say i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason in the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph no doubt that the solution had truly accomplished at least temporarily its full mission of restoring rational and articulate life to the dead but in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrorsnot horror of the thing that spoke but of the deed that i had witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joinedfor that very fresh body at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brainhelp keep off you cursed little towhead fiendkeep that damned needle away from mev the horror from the shadowsmany men have related hideous things not mentioned in print which happened on the battlefields of the great war some of these things have made me faint others have convulsed me with devastating nausea while still others have made me tremble and look behind me in the dark yet despite the worst of them i believe i can myself relate the most hideous thing of allthe shocking the unnatural the unbelievable horror from the shadowsin 1915 i was a physician with the rank of first lieutenant in a canadian regiment in flanders one of many americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle i had not entered the army on my own initiative but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant i wasthe celebrated boston surgical specialist dr herbert west dr west had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war and when the chance had come he carried me with him almost against my will there were reasons why i would have been glad to let the war separate us reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleagues influence secured a medical commission as major i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacitywhen i say that dr west was avid to serve in battle i do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation always an icecold intellectual machine slight blond blueeyed and spectacled i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality there was however something he wanted in embattled flanders and in order to secure it he had to assume a military exterior what he wanted was not a thing which many persons want but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results it was in fact nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismembermentherbert west needed fresh bodies because his lifework was the reanimation of the dead this work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in boston but was only too well known to me who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in miskatonic university medical school at arkham it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained there was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways he had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh a certain number of these failures had remained aliveone was in an asylum while others had vanishedand as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stoliditywest had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in bodysnatching in college and during our early practice together in the factory town of bolton my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration but as his boldness in methods grew i began to develop a gnawing fear i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it that was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse and his success obtained at such a loathsome cost had completely hardened himof his methods in the intervening five years i dare not speak i was held to him by sheer force of fear and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat gradually i came to find herbert west himself more horrible than anything he didthat was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness his interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust he became behind his pallid intellectuality a fastidious baudelaire of physical experimenta languid elagabalus of the tombsdangers he met unflinchingly crimes he committed unmoved i think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies he had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nervetissue separated from natural physiological systems and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of neverdying artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settlefirst whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain proceeding from the spinal cord and various nervecentres and second whether any kind of ethereal intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism all this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human fleshand that was why herbert west had entered the great warthe phantasmal unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march 1915 in a field hospital behind the lines at st eloi i wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium west had a private laboratory in an east room of the barnlike temporary edifice assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory waresi could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned among these sounds were frequent revolvershotssurely not uncommon on a battlefield but distinctly uncommon in an hospital dr wests reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience besides human tissue west employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results it was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments and that was now my friends chief activity in a dark corner of the laboratory over a queer incubating burner he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian cellmatter which multiplied and grew puffily and hideouslyon the night of which i speak we had a splendid new specimena man at once physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured it was rather ironic for he was the officer who had helped west to his commission and who was now to have been our associate moreover he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under west major sir eric moreland claphamlee dso was the greatest surgeon in our division and had been hastily assigned to the st eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters he had come in an aroplane piloted by the intrepid lieut ronald hill only to be shot down when directly over his destination the fall had been spectacular and awful hill was unrecognisable afterward but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition west had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and fellowscholar and i shuddered when he finished severing the head placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptiletissue to preserve it for future experiments and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table he injected new blood joined certain veins arteries and nerves at the headless neck and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officers uniform i knew what he wantedto see if this highly organised body could exhibit without its head any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished sir eric moreland claphamlee once a student of reanimation this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify iti can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body the scene i cannot describei should faint if i tried it for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things with blood and lesser human debris almost ankledeep on the slimy floor and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting bubbling and baking over a winking bluishgreen spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadowsthe specimen as west repeatedly observed had a splendid nervous system much was expected of it and as a few twitching motions began to appear i could see the feverish interest on wests face he was ready i think to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness reason and personality can exist independently of the brainthat man has no central connective spirit but is merely a machine of nervous matter each section more or less complete in itself in one triumphant demonstration west was about to relegate the mystery of life to the category of myth the body now twitched more vigorously and beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way the arms stirred disquietingly the legs drew up and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperationan intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of herbert west certainly the nerves were recalling the mans last act in life the struggle to get free of the falling aroplanewhat followed i shall never positively know it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german shellfirewho can gainsay it since west and i were the only proved survivors west liked to think that before his recent disappearance but there were times when he could not for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination the hideous occurrence itself was very simple notable only for what it impliedthe body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping and we had heard a sound i should not call that sound a voice for it was too awful and yet its timbre was not the most awful thing about it neither was its messageit had merely screamed jump ronald for gods sake jump the awful thing was its sourcefor it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadowsvi the tomblegionswhen dr herbert west disappeared a year ago the boston police questioned me closely they suspected that i was holding something back and perhaps suspected graver things but i could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it they knew indeed that west had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men for his hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect secrecy but the final soulshattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what i sawi was wests closest friend and only confidential assistant we had met years before in medical school and from the first i had shared his terrible researches he had slowly tried to perfect a solution which injected into the veins of the newly deceased would restore life a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions still more shocking were the products of some of the experimentsgrisly masses of flesh that had been dead but that west waked to a blind brainless nauseous animation these were the usual results for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate braincellsthis need for very fresh corpses had been wests moral undoing they were hard to get and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous a struggle a needle and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique toward the last i became acutely afraid of west for he began to look at me that way people did not seem to notice his glances but they noticed my fear and after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicionswest in reality was more afraid than i for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow partly it was the police he feared but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life and from which he had not seen that life depart he usually finished his experiments with a revolver but a few times he had not been quick enough there was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen there was also that arkham professors body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at sefton where it beat the walls for sixteen years most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak offor in later years wests scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies or parts joined to organic matter other than human it had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print the great war through which both of us served as surgeons had intensified this side of westin saying that wests fear of his specimens was nebulous i have in mind particularly its complex nature part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless monsters while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him their disappearance added horror to the situationof them all west knew the whereabouts of only one the pitiful asylum thing then there was a more subtle feara very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the canadian army in 1915 west in the midst of a severe battle had reanimated major sir eric moreland claphamlee dso a fellowphysician who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them the head had been removed so that the possibilities of quasiintelligent life in the trunk might be investigated just as the building was wiped out by a german shell there had been a success the trunk had moved intelligently and unbelievable to relate we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory the shell had been merciful in a waybut west could never feel as certain as he wished that we two were the only survivors he used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the deadwests last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance overlooking one of the oldest buryinggrounds in boston he had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies the laboratory was in a subcellar secretly constructed by imported workmen and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal of such bodies or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner during the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient masonry undoubtedly connected with the old buryingground yet far too deep to correspond with any known sepulchre therein after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills where the last interment had been made in 1768 i was with him when he studied the nitrous dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of the men and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the uncovering of centuried gravesecrets but for the first time wests new timidity conquered his natural curiosity and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over thus it remained till that final hellish night part of the walls of the secret laboratory i speak of wests decadence but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing outwardly he was the same to the lastcalm cold slight and yellowhaired with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change he seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and looked over his shoulder even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and pawed at sefton barsthe end of herbert west began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me a strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years something fearsome and incredible had happened at sefton asylum fifty miles away stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police in the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds and their leader had aroused the attendants he was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried his expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on itfor it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass some nameless accident had befallen this man a larger man guided his steps a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady the speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from arkham sixteen years before and upon being refused gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot the fiends had beaten trampled and bitten every attendant who did not flee killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the waxfaced leader by the time help could be summoned every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanishedfrom the hour of reading this item until midnight west sat almost paralysed at midnight the doorbell rang startling him fearfully all the servants were asleep in the attic so i answered the bell as i have told the police there was no wagon in the street but only a group of strangelooking figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice expressprepaid they filed out of the house with a jerky tread and as i watched them go i had an odd idea that they were turning toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted when i slammed the door after them west came downstairs and looked at the box it was about two feet square and bore wests correct name and present address it also bore the inscription from eric moreland claphamlee st eloi flanders six years before in flanders a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of dr claphamlee and upon the detached head whichperhapshad uttered articulate soundswest was not even excited now his condition was more ghastly quickly he said its the finishbut lets incineratethis we carried the thing down to the laboratorylistening i do not remember many particularsyou can imagine my state of mindbut it is a vicious lie to say it was herbert wests body which i put into the incinerator we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box closed the door and started the electricity nor did any sound come from the box after allit was west who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb masonry had been covered up i was going to run but he stopped me then i saw a small black aperture felt a ghoulish wind of ice and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth there was no sound but just then the electric lights went out and i saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanityor worsecould create their outlines were human semihuman fractionally human and not human at allthe horde was grotesquely heterogeneous they were removing the stones quietly one by one from the centuried wall and then as the breach became large enough they came out into the laboratory in single file led by a stalking thing with a beautiful head made of wax a sort of madeyed monstrosity behind the leader seized on herbert west west did not resist or utter a sound then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations wests head was carried off by the waxheaded leader who wore a canadian officers uniform as it disappeared i saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic visible emotionservants found me unconscious in the morning west was gone the incinerator contained only unidentifiable ashes detectives have questioned me but what can i say the sefton tragedy they will not connect with west not that nor the men with the box whose existence they deny i told them of the vault and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed so i told them no more they imply that i am a madman or a murdererprobably i am mad but i might not be mad if those accursed tomblegions had not been so silent,1

there had happened in the teeming and manytowered city of zeth one of those incidents which are prone to take place in all capitals of all worlds nor simply because zeth lies on a planet of strange beasts and stranger vegetation did this incident differ greatly from what might have occurred in london or paris or any of the great governing towns we know through the cleverly concealed dishonesty of an aged but shrewd official the treasury was exhausted no shiningphrulderas of old lay stacked about the strongroom and over empty coffers the sardonic spider wove webs of mocking design when at last thegiphathyalden entered that obscure vault and discovered the thefts there were left only some phlegmatic rats which peered sharply at him as at an alien intruderthere had been no accountings since kishan the old keeper had died many moonturns before and great was yaldens dismay to find this emptiness instead of the expected wealth the indifference of the small creatures in the cracks between the flagstones could not spread itself to him this was a very grave matter and would have to be met in a very prompt and serious way clearly there was nothing to do but consult oorn and oorn was a highly portentous beingoorn though a creature of extremely doubtful nature was the virtual ruler of zeth it obviously belonged somewhere in the outer abyss but had blundered into zeth one night and suffered capture by theshamithpriests the coincidence of its excessively bizarre aspect and its innate gift of mimicry had impressed the sacred brothers as offering vast possibilities hence in the end they had set it up as a god and an oracle organising a new brotherhood to serve itand incidentally to suggest the edicts it should utter and the replies it should give like the delphi and dodona of a later world oorn grew famous as a giver of judgments and solver of riddles nor did its essence differ from them save that it lay infinitely earlier in time and upon an elder world where all things might happen and now yalden being not above the credulousness of his day and planet had set out for the closeguarded and richlyfitted hall wherein oorn brooded and mimicked the promptings of the priestswhen yalden came within sight of the hall with its tower of blue tile he became properly religious and entered the building acceptably in a humble manner which greatly impeded progress according to custom the guardians of the deity acknowledged his obeisance and pecuniary offering and retired behind heavy curtains to ignite the thuribles after everything was in readiness yalden murmured a conventional prayer and bowed low before a curious empty dais studded with exotic jewels for a momentas the ritual prescribedhe stayed in this abased position and when he arose the dais was no longer empty unconcernedly munching something the priests had given it was a large pudgy creature very hard to describe and covered with short grey fur whence it had come in so brief a time only the priests might tell but the suppliant knew that it was oornhesitantly yalden stated his unfortunate mission and asked advice weaving into his discourse the type of flattery which seemed to him most discreet then with anxiety he awaited the oracles response having tidily finished its food oorn raised three small reddish eyes to yalden and uttered certain words in a tone of vast decisivenessgumay ere hfotuol leheht tegafter this it vanished suddenly in a cloud of pink smoke which seemed to issue from behind the curtain where the acolytes were the acolytes then came forth from their hidingplace and spoke to yalden saying since you have pleased the deity with your concise statement of a very deplorable state of affairs we are honored by interpreting its directions the aphorism you heard signifies no less than the equally mystic phrase go thou unto thy destination or more properly speaking you are to slay the monsterwizard anathas and replenish the treasury with its fabled hoardwith this yalden was dismissed from the temple it may not be said in veracity that he was fearless for in truth he was openly afraid of the monster anathas as were all the inhabitants of ullathia and the surrounding land even those who doubted its actuality would not have chosen to reside in the immediate neighborhood of the cave of three winds wherein it was said to dwellbut the prospect was not without romantic appeal and yalden was young and consequently unwise he knew among other things that there was always the hope of rescuing some feminine victim of the monsters famed and surprising erotic taste of the true aspect of anathas none could be certain tales of a widely opposite nature being commonly circulated many vowed it had been seen from afar in the form of a giant black shadow peculiarly repugnant to human taste while others alleged it was a mound of gelatinous substance that oozed hatefully in the manner of putrescent flesh still others claimed they had seen it as a monstrous insect with astonishing supernumerary appurtenances but in one thing all coincided namely that it was advisable to have as little traffic as possible with anathaswith due supplications to his gods and to their messenger oorn yalden set out for the cave of three winds in his bosom were mixed an ingrained patriotic sense of duty and a thrill of adventurous expectancy regarding the unknown mysteries he faced he had not neglected such preparations as a sensible man might make and a wizard of old repute had furnished him with certain singular accessories he had for example a charm which prevented his thirsting or hungering and wholly did away with his need for provisions there was likewise a glistening cape to counteract the evil emanations of a mineral that lay scattered over the rocky ground along his course other warnings and safeguards dealt with certain gaudy landcrustaceans and with the deathlysweet mists which arise at certain points until dispersed by heliotropismthus shielded yalden fared without incident until he came to the place of the white worm here of necessity he delayed to make preparations for finding the rest of his way with patient diligence he captured the small colorless maggot and surrounded it with a curious mark made with green paint as was prophesied the lord of worms whose name was sarall made promise of certain things in return for its freedom then yalden released it and it crawled away after directing him on the course he was to followthe sere and fruitless land through which he now travelled was totally uninhabited not even the hardier of the beasts were to be seen beyond the edge of that final plateau which separated him from his goal far off in a purplish haze rose the mountains amidst which dwelt anathas it lived not solitary despite the lonely region around for strange pets resided with itsome the fabled elder monsters and others unique beings created by its own fearful craftat the heart of its cave legend said anathas had concealed an enormous hoard of jewels gold and other things of fabulous value why so potent a wonderworker should care for such gauds or revel in the counting of money was by no means clear but many things attested the truth of these tastes great numbers of persons of stronger will and wit than yalden had died in remarkable manners while seeking the hoard of the wizardbeast and their bones were laid in a strange pattern before the mouth of the cave as a warning to otherswhen after countless vicissitudes yalden came at last into sight of the cave of winds amid the glistening boulders he knew indeed that report had not lied concerning the isolation of anathas lair the cavernmouth was wellconcealed and over everything an ominous quiet lowered there was no trace of habitation save of course the ossuary ornamentation in the front yard with his hand on the sword that had been sanctified by a priest of oorn yalden tremblingly advanced when he had attained the very opening of the lair he hesitated no longer for it was evident that the monster was awaydeeming this the best of all times to prosecute his business yalden plunged at once within the cave the interior was very cramped and exceedingly dirty but the roof glittered with an innumerable array of small varicoloured lights the source of which was not to be perceived in the rear yawned another opening either natural or artificial and to this black lowarched burrow yalden hastened crawling within it on hands and knees before long a faint blue radiance glowed at the farther end and presently the searcher emerged into an ampler space straightening up he beheld a most singular change in his surroundings this second cavern was tall and domed as if it had been shapen by supernatural powers and a soft blue and silver light infused the gloom anathas thought yalden lived indeed in comfort for this room was finer than anything in the palace of zeth or even in the temple of oorn upon which had been lavished unthinkable wealth and beauty yalden stood agape but not for long since he desired most of all to seek the object of his quest and depart before anathas should return from wherever it might be for yalden did not wish to encounter the monstersorcerer of which so many tales were told leaving therefore this second cave by a narrow cleft which he saw the seeker followed a devious and unlit way far down through the solid rock of the plateau this he felt would take him to that third and ultimate cavern where his business lay as he progressed he glimpsed ahead of him a curious glow and at last without warning the walls receded to reveal a vast open space paved solidly with blazing coals above which flapped and shrieked an obscene flock of wyvernheaded birds over the fiery surface green monstrous salamanders slithered eyeing the intruder with malignant speculation and on the far side rose the stairs of a metal dais encrusted with jewels and piled high with precious objects the hoard of the wizardbeastat sight of this unattainable wealth yaldens fervour wellnigh overcame him and chaffing at his futility he searched the sea of flame for some way of crossing this he soon perceived was not readily to be found for in all that glowing crypt there was only a slight crescent of flooring near the entrance which a mortal man might hope to walk on desperation however possessed him so that at last he resolved to risk all and try the fiery pavement better to die in the quest than to return emptyhanded with teeth set he started toward the sea of flame heedless of what might followas it was surprise seared him almost as vehemently as he had expected the flames to dofor with his advance the glowing floor divided to form a narrow lane of safe cool earth leading straight to the golden throne half dazed and heedless of whatever might underlie such curiously favouring magic yalden drew his sword and strode boldly betwixt the walls of flame that rose from the rifted pavement the heat hurt him not at all and the wyverncreatures drew back hissing and did not molest himthe hoard now glistened close at hand and yalden thought of how he would return to zeth laden with fabulous spoils and worshipped by throngs as a hero in his joy he forgot to wonder at anathas lax care of its treasures nor did the very friendly behaviour of the fiery pavement seem in any way remarkable even the huge arched opening behind the dais so oddly invisible from across the cavern failed to disturb him seriously only when he had mounted the broad stair of the dais and stood ankledeep amid the bizarre golden reliques of other ages and other worlds and the lovely luminous gems from unknown mines and of unknown natures and meanings did yalden begin to realise that anything was wrongbut now he perceived that the miraculous passage through the flaming floor was closing again leaving him marooned on the dais with the glittering treasure he had sought and when it had fully closed and his eyes had circled round vainly for some way of escape he was hardly reassured by the shapeless jellylike shadow which loomed colossal and stinking in the great archway behind the dais he was not permitted to faint but was forced to observe that this shadow was infinitely more hideous than anything hinted in any popular legend and that its seven iridescent eyes were regarding him with placid amusementthen anathas the wizardbeast rolled fully out of the archway mighty in necromantic horror and jested with the small frightened conqueror before allowing that horde of slavering and peculiarly hungry green salamanders to complete their slow anticipatory ascent of the dais,1
i have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the horror at martins beach despite the large number of witnesses no two accounts agree and the testimony taken by local authorities contains the most amazing discrepanciesperhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheardof character of the horror itself the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it and the efforts made by the fashionable wavecrest inn to hush it up after the publicity created by prof altons article are hypnotic powers confined to recognized humanityagainst all these obstacles i am striving to present a coherent version for i beheld the hideous occurrence and believe it should be known in view of the appalling possibilities it suggests martins beach is once more popular as a wateringplace but i shudder when i think of it indeed i cannot look at the ocean at all now without shudderingfate is not always without a sense of drama and climax hence the terrible happening of august 8 1922 swiftly followed a period of minor and agreeably wonderfraught excitement at martins beach on may 17 the crew of the fishing smackalmaof gloucester under capt james p orne killed after a battle of nearly forty hours a marine monster whose size and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific circles and caused certain boston naturalists to take every precaution for its taxidermic preservationthe object was some fifty feet in length of roughly cylindrical shape and about ten feet in diameter it was unmistakably a gilled fish in its major affiliations but with certain curious modifications such as rudimentary forelegs and sixtoed feet in place of pectoral fins which prompted the widest speculation its extraordinary mouth its thick and scaly hide and its single deepset eye were wonders scarcely less remarkable than its colossal dimensions and when the naturalists pronounced it an infant organism which could not have been hatched more than a few days public interest mounted to extraordinary heightscapt orne with typical yankee shrewdness obtained a vessel large enough to hold the object in its hull and arranged for the exhibition of his prize with judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an excellent marine museum and sailing south to the wealthy resort district of martins beach anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a harvest of admission feesthe intrinsic marvelousness of the object and the importance which it clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and far combined to make it the seasons sensation that it was absolutely uniqueunique to a scientifically revolutionary degreewas well understood the naturalists had shown plainly that it radically differed from the similarly immense fish caught off the florida coast that while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths perhaps thousands of feet its brain and principal organs indicated a development startlingly vast and out of all proportion to anything hitherto associated with the fish tribeon the morning of july 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of the vessel and its strange treasure in the storm of the preceding night it had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the sight of man carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite the threatening weather capt orne backed by extensive scientific interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from gloucester made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise but with no result other than the prompting of interest and conversation by august 7 hope was abandoned and capt orne had returned to the wavecrest inn to wind up his business affairs at martins beach and confer with certain of the scientific men who remained there the horror came on august 8it was in the twilight when grey seabirds hovered low near the shore and a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters the scene is important to remember for every impression counts on the beach were several strollers and a few late bathers stragglers from the distant cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the north or from the adjacent cliffperched inn whose imposing towers proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeurwell within viewing distance was another set of spectators the loungers on the inns highceiled and lanternlighted veranda who appeared to be enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom inside these spectators who included capt orne and his group of scientific confreres joined the beach group before the horror progressed far as did many more from the inn certainly there was no lack of witnesses confused though their stories be with fear and doubt of what they sawthere is no exact record of the time the thing began although a majority say that the fairly round moon was about a foot above the lowlying vapors of the horizon they mention the moon because what they saw seemed subtly connected with ita sort of stealthy deliberate menacing ripple which rolled in from the far skyline along the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams yet which seemed to subside before it reached the shoremany did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events but it seems to have been very marked differing in height and motion from the normal waves around it some called itcunningandcalculatingand as it died away craftily by the black reefs afar out there suddenly came belching up out of the glitterstreaked brine a cry of death a scream of anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked itfirst to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty sturdy fellows in white bathing attire with their calling proclaimed in large red letters across their chests accustomed as they were to rescue work and to the screams of the drowning they could find nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation yet with a trained sense of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their usual coursehastily seizing an aircushion which with its attached coil of rope lay always at hand one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the scene of the gathering crowd whence after whirling it about to gain momentum he flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which the sound had come as the cushion disappeared in the waves the crowd curiously awaited a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been so great eager to see the rescue made by the massive ropebut that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter for pull as they might on the rope the two muscular guards could not move the object at the other end instead they found that object pulling with equal or even greater force in the very opposite direction till in a few seconds they were dragged off their feet and into the water by the strange power which had seized on the proffered lifepreserverone of them recovering himself called immediately for help from the crowd on the shore to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope and in a moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men among whom capt orne was foremost more than a dozen strong hands were now tugging desperately at the stout line yet wholly without availhard as they tugged the strange force at the other end tugged harder and since neither side relaxed for an instant the rope became rigid as steel with the enormous strain the struggling participants as well as the spectators were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the nature of the force in the sea the idea of a drowning man had long been dismissed and hints of whales submarines monsters and demons now passed freely around where humanity had first led the rescuers wonder kept them at their task and they hauled with a grim determination to uncover the mysteryit being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the aircushion capt orne as a natural leader shouted to those on the shore that a boat must be obtained in order to approach harpoon and land the unseen leviathan several men at once prepared to scatter in quest of a suitable craft while others came to supplant the captain at the straining rope since his place was logically with whatever boat party might be formed his own idea of the situation was very broad and by no means limited to whales since he had to do with a monster so much stranger he wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an adult of the species of which the fiftyfoot creature had been the merest infantand now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact which changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror and dazed with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers capt orne turning to leave his post at the rope found his hands held in their place with unaccountable strength and in a moment he realized that he was unable to let go of the rope his plight was instantly divined and as each companion tested his own situation the same condition was encountered the fact could not be deniedevery struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the hempen line which was slowly hideously and relentlessly pulling them out to seaspeechless horror ensued a horror in which the spectators were petrified to utter inaction and mental chaos their complete demoralization is reflected in the conflicting accounts they give and the sheepish excuses they offer for their seemingly callous inertia i was one of them and knoweven the strugglers after a few frantic screams and futile groans succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in the face of unknown powers there they stood in the pallid moonlight blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously backward and forward as the water rose first to their knees then to their hips the moon went partly under a cloud and in the halflight the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping deathharder and harder grew the rope as the tug in both directions increased and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the rising waves slowly the tide advanced till the sands so lately peopled by laughing children and whispering lovers were now swallowed by the inexorable flow the herd of panicstricken watchers surged blindly backward as the water crept above their feet while the frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on half submerged and now at a substantial distance from their audience silence was completethe crowd having gained a huddlingplace beyond reach of the tide stared in mute fascination without offering a word of advice or encouragement or attempting any kind of assistance there was in the air a nightmare fear of impending evils such as the world had never before knownminutes seemed lengthened into hours and still that human snake of swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide rhythmically it undulated slowly horribly with the seal of doom upon it thicker clouds now passed over the ascending moon and the glittering path on the waters faded nearly outvery dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads with now and then the livid face of a backwardglancing victim gleaming pale in the darkness faster and faster gathered the clouds till at length their angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame thunders rolled softly at first yet soon increasing to a deafening maddening intensity then came a culminating crasha shock whose reverberations seemed to shake land and sea alikeand on its heels a cloudburst whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the heavens themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrentthe spectators instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious and coherent thought now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel veranda rumors had reached the guests inside so that the refugees found a state of terror nearly equal to their own i think a few frightened words were uttered but cannot be suresome who were staying at the inn retired in terror to their rooms while others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of bobbing heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning flashes i recall thinking of those heads and the bulging eyes they must contain eyes that might well reflect all the fright panic and delirium of a malignant universeall the sorrow sin and misery blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires fear loathing and anguish of the ages since times beginning eyes alight with all the soulracking pain of eternally blazing infernosand as i gazed out beyond the heads my fancy conjured up still another eye a single eye equally alight yet with a purpose so revolting to my brain that the vision soon passed held in the clutches of an unknown vise the line of the damned dragged on their silent screams and unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and the nightwindthere now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed amidst a blinding glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated in one apocalyptic planetrending peal of cyclopean din it was the end of the storm for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted seathere was no line of bobbing heads now the waters were calm and deserted and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a whirlpool far out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry had first come but as i looked along that treacherous lane of silvery sheen with fancy fevered and senses overwrought there trickled upon my ears from some abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of a laugh,1
there are sacraments of evil as well as of good about us and we live and move to my belief in an unknown world a place where there are caves and shadows and dwellers in twilight it is possible that man may sometimes return on the track of evolution and it is my belief that an awful lore is not yet deadarthur macheninot many weeks ago on a street corner in the village of pascoag rhode island a tall heavily built and wholesomelooking pedestrian furnished much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour he had it appears been descending the hill by the road from chepachet and encountering the compact section had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban at this point without visible provocation he committed his astonishing lapse staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him and then with a series of terrified hysterical shrieks breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing picked up and dusted off by ready hands he was found to be conscious organically unhurt and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack he muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone and with downcast glance turned back up the chepachet road trudging out of sight without once looking behind him it was a strange incident to befall so large robust normalfeatured and capablelooking a man and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised him as the boarder of a wellknown dairyman on the outskirts of chepachethe was it developed a new york police detective named thomas f malone now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident had made dramatic there had been a collapse of several old brick buildings during a raid in which he had shared and something about the wholesale loss of life both of prisoners and of his companions had peculiarly appalled him as a result he had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the ones which had fallen in so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight of such things for an indefinite period a police surgeon with relatives in chepachet had put forward that quaint hamlet of wooden colonial houses as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence and thither the sufferer had gone promising never to venture among the bricklined streets of larger villages till duly advised by the woonsocket specialist with whom he was put in touch this walk to pascoag for magazines had been a mistake and the patient had paid in fright bruises and humiliation for his disobedienceso much the gossips of chepachet and pascoag knew and so much also the most learned specialists believed but malone had at first told the specialists much more ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity was his portion thereafter he held his peace protesting not at all when it was generally agreed that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in the red hook section of brooklyn and the consequent death of many brave officers had unseated his nervous equilibrium he had worked too hard all said in trying to clean up those nests of disorder and violence certain features were shocking enough in all conscience and the unexpected tragedy was the last straw this was a simple explanation which everyone could understand and because malone was not a simple person he perceived that he had better let it suffice to hint to unimaginative people of a horror beyond all human conceptiona horror of houses and blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder worldswould be merely to invite a padded cell instead of restful rustication and malone was a man of sense despite his mysticism he had the celts far vision of weird and hidden things but the logicians quick eye for the outwardly unconvincing an amalgam which had led him far afield in the fortytwo years of his life and set him in strange places for a dublin university man born in a georgian villa near phoenix parkand now as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended malone was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a dauntless fighter to a quivering neurotic what could make old brick slums and seas of dark subtle faces a thing of nightmare and eldritch portent it would not be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide uninterpretedfor was not his very act of plunging into the polyglot abyss of new yorks underworld a freak beyond sensible explanation what could he tell the prosaic of the antique witcheries and grotesque marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison cauldron where all the varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and perpetuate their obscene terrors he had seen the hellish green flame of secret wonder in this blatant evasive welter of outward greed and inward blasphemy and had smiled gently when all the newyorkers he knew scoffed at his experiment in police work they had been very witty and cynical deriding his fantastic pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in these days new york held nothing but cheapness and vulgarity one of them had wagered him a heavy sum that he could notdespite many poignant things to his credit in thedublin revieweven write a truly interesting story of new york low life and now looking back he perceived that cosmic irony had justified the prophets words while secretly confuting their flippant meaning the horror as glimpsed at last could not make a storyfor like the book cited by poes german authorityes lsst sich nicht lesenit does not permit itself to be readiito malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present in youth he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things and had been a poet but poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker directions and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world around daily life had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre shadowstudies now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in beardsleys best manner now hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work of gustave dor he would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries for he argued if superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world but threaten the very integrity of the universe all this reflection was no doubt morbid but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as halfspied and forbidden visions to be lightly played with and hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escapehe had for some time been detailed to the butler street station in brooklyn when the red hook matter came to his notice red hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near the ancient waterfront opposite governors island with dirty highways climbing the hill from the wharves to that higher ground where the decayed lengths of clinton and court streets lead off toward the borough hall its houses are mostly of brick dating from the first quarter to the middle of the nineteenth century and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring antique flavour which conventional reading leads us to call dickensian the population is a hopeless tangle and enigma syrian spanish italian and negro elements impinging upon one another and fragments of scandinavian and american belts lying not far distant it is a babel of sound and filth and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the harbour whistles here long ago a brighter picture dwelt with cleareyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance where the larger houses line the hill one can trace the relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the buildings the occasional graceful churches and the evidences of original art and background in bits of detail here and therea worn flight of steps a battered doorway a wormy pair of decorative columns or pilasters or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron railing the houses are generally in solid blocks and now and then a manywindowed cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and shipowners watched the seafrom this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred dialects assail the sky hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes and thoroughfares occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains and swarthy sinpitted faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through policemen despair of order or reform and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the contagion the clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative visible offences are as varied as the local dialects and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises that these visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhoods credit unless the power of concealment be an art demanding credit more people enter red hook than leave itor at least than leave it by the landward sideand those who are not loquacious are the likeliest to leavemalone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists he was conscious as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive halfape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances and he had often viewed with an anthropologists shudder the chanting cursing processions of bleareyed and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning one saw groups of these youths incessantly sometimes in leering vigils on street corners sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap instruments of music sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria tables near borough hall and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses they chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the force for he seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret continuity some fiendish cryptical and ancient pattern utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts listed with such conscientious technical care by the police they must be he felt inwardly the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind their coherence and definiteness suggested it and it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their squalid disorder he had not read in vain such treatises as miss murrayswitchcult in western europeand knew that up to recent years there had certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark religions antedating the aryan world and appearing in popular legends as black masses and witches sabbaths that these hellish vestiges of old turanianasiatic magic and fertilitycults were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment suppose and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of them might really beiiiit was the case of robert suydam which took malone to the heart of things in red hook suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient dutch family possessed originally of barely independent means and inhabiting the spacious but illpreserved mansion which his grandfather had built in flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and ivyclad reformed church with its ironrailed yard of netherlandish gravestones in his lonely house set back from martense street amidst a yard of venerable trees suydam had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a generation before when he had sailed for the old world and remained there out of sight for eight years he could afford no servants and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude eschewing close friendships and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three groundfloor rooms which he kept in ordera vast highceiled library whose walls were solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous archaic and vaguely repellent aspect the growth of the town and its final absorption in the brooklyn district had meant nothing to suydam and he had come to mean less and less to the town elderly people still pointed him out on the streets but to most of the recent population he was merely a queer corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair stubbly beard shiny black clothes and goldheaded cane earned him an amused glance and nothing more malone did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound authority on mediaeval superstition and had once idly meant to look up an outofprint pamphlet of his on the kabbalah and the faustus legend which a friend had quoted from memorysuydam became a case when his distant and only relatives sought court pronouncements on his sanity their action seemed sudden to the outside world but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful debate it was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits wild references to impending wonders and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable brooklyn neighbourhoods he had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations or loitering on the benches around borough hall in conversation with groups of swarthy evillooking strangers when he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as sephiroth ashmodai and samal the court action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported from london and paris and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the red hook district where he spent nearly every night receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and foreigners and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the green blinds of secretive windows detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section when however the matter came to a hearing suydam managed to preserve his liberty before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research he was he said engaged in the investigation of certain details of european tradition which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances the notion that any low secret society was preying upon him as hinted by his relatives was obviously absurd and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work triumphing with his calm explanations he was suffered to depart unhindered and the paid detectives of the suydams corlears and van brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgustit was here that an alliance of federal inspectors and police malone with them entered the case the law had watched the suydam action with interest and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives in this work it developed that suydams new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of red hooks devious lanes and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery disorder and the importation of illegal immigrants indeed it would not have been too much to say that the old scholars particular circle coincided almost perfectly with the worst of the organised cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and unclassified asian dregs wisely turned back by ellis island in the teeming rookeries of parker placesince renamedwhere suydam had his basement flat there had grown up a very unusual colony of unclassified slanteyed folk who used the arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by the great mass of syrians in and around atlantic avenue they could all have been deported for lack of credentials but legalism is slowmoving and one does not disturb red hook unless publicity forces one tothese creatures attended a tumbledown stone church used wednesdays as a dancehall which reared its gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the waterfront it was nominally catholic but priests throughout brooklyn denied the place all standing and authenticity and policemen agreed with them when they listened to the noises it emitted at night malone used to fancy he heard terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far underground when the church stood empty and unlighted whilst all observers dreaded the shrieking and drumming which accompanied the visible services suydam when questioned said he thought the ritual was some remnant of nestorian christianity tinctured with the shamanism of thibet most of the people he conjectured were of mongoloid stock originating somewhere in or near kurdistanand malone could not help recalling that kurdistan is the land of the yezidis last survivors of the persian devilworshippers however this may have been the stir of the suydam investigation made it certain that these unauthorised newcomers were flooding red hook in increasing numbers entering through some marine conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police overrunning parker place and rapidly spreading up the hill and welcomed with curious fraternalism by the other assorted denizens of the region their squat figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies grotesquely combined with flashy american clothing appeared more and more numerously among the loafers and nomad gangsters of the borough hall section till at length it was deemed necessary to compute their numbers ascertain their sources and occupations and find if possible a way to round them up and deliver them to the proper immigration authorities to this task malone was assigned by agreement of federal and city forces and as he commenced his canvass of red hook he felt poised upon the brink of nameless terrors with the shabby unkempt figure of robert suydam as archfiend and adversaryivpolice methods are varied and ingenious malone through unostentatious rambles carefully casual conversations welltimed offers of hippocket liquor and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners learned many isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing the newcomers were indeed kurds but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology such of them as worked lived mostly as dockhands and unlicenced pedlars though frequently serving in greek restaurants and tending corner news stands most of them however had no visible means of support and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits of which smuggling and bootlegging were the least indescribable they had come in steamships apparently tramp freighters and had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf and followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house this wharf canal and house malone could not locate for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused while their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters nor could he gain any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation they were reticent about the exact spot from which they had come and were never sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out and directed their course indeed they developed something like acute fright when asked the reasons for their presence gangsters of other breeds were equally taciturn and the most that could be gathered was that some god or great priesthood had promised them unheardof powers and supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange landthe attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at suydams closely guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular and the police soon learned that the erstwhile recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such guests as knew his password at last occupying three entire houses and permanently harbouring many of his queer companions he spent but little time now at his flatbush home apparently going and coming only to obtain and return books and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch of wildness malone twice interviewed him but was each time brusquely repulsed he knew nothing he said of any mysterious plots or movements and had no idea how the kurds could have entered or what they wanted his business was to study undisturbed the folklore of all the immigrants of the district a business with which policemen had no legitimate concern malone mentioned his admiration for suydams old brochure on the kabbalah and other myths but the old mans softening was only momentary he sensed an intrusion and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain way till malone withdrew disgusted and turned to other channels of informationwhat malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the case we shall never know as it was a stupid conflict between city and federal authority suspended the investigations for several months during which the detective was busy with other assignments but at no time did he lose interest or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to robert suydam just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over new york the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd one day he was seen near borough hall with cleanshaved face welltrimmed hair and tastefully immaculate attire and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him he maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of speech and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so long deformed him now frequently taken for less than his age he acquired an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye as the months passed he commenced to dress less and less conservatively and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his flatbush mansion which he threw open in a series of receptions summoning all the acquaintances he could remember and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint some attended through curiosity others through duty but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit he had he asserted accomplished most of his allotted work and having just inherited some property from a halfforgotten european friend was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease care and diet had made possible to him less and less was he seen at red hook and more and more did he move in the society to which he was born policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and dancehall instead of at the basement flat in parker place though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious lifethen two incidents occurredwide enough apart but both of intense interest in the case as malone envisaged it one was a quiet announcement in theeagleof robert suydams engagement to miss cornelia gerritsen of bayside a young woman of excellent position and distantly related to the elderly bridegroomelect whilst the other was a raid on the dancehall church by city police after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows malone had participated in this raid and studied the place with much care when inside nothing was foundin fact the building was entirely deserted when visitedbut the sensitive celt was vaguely disturbed by many things about the interior there were crudely painted panels he did not likepanels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions and which occasionally took liberties that even a laymans sense of decorum could scarcely countenance then too he did not relish the greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit an ancient incantation which he had once stumbled upon in dublin college days and which read literally translatedo friend and companion of night thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals gorgo mormo thousandfaced moon look favourably on our sacrificeswhen he read this he shuddered and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights he shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood on the altar and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood that organ memory haunted him and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he left the place was very hateful to him yet after all were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorantby the time of suydams wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a popular newspaper scandal most of the victims were young children of the lowest classes but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the strongest fury journals clamoured for action from the police and once more the butler street station sent its men over red hook for clues discoveries and criminals malone was glad to be on the trail again and took pride in a raid on one of suydams parker place houses there indeed no stolen child was found despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous the paintings were appallinghideous monsters of every shape and size and parodies on human outlines which cannot be described the writing was in red and varied from arabic to greek roman and hebrew letters malone could not read much of it but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough one frequently repeated motto was in a sort of hebraised hellenistic greek and suggested the most terrible daemonevocations of the alexandrian decadencehel heloym sother emmanvel sabaoth agla tetragrammaton agyros otheos ischyros athanatos iehova va adonai saday homovsion messias eschereheyecircles and pentagrams loomed on every hand and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here in the cellar however the strangest thing was founda pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap and bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls during the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting orientals that swarmed from every door finding nothing relevant they had to leave all as it was but the precinct captain wrote suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants and protgs in view of the growing public clamourvthen came the june wedding and the great sensation flatbush was gay for the hour about high noon and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway no local event ever surpassed the suydamgerritsen nuptials in tone and scale and the party which escorted bride and groom to the cunard pier was if not exactly the smartest at least a solid page from the social register at five oclock adieux were waved and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier slowly turned its nose seaward discarded its tug and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders by night the outer harbour was cleared and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted oceanwhether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention no one can say probably they were simultaneous but it is of no use to calculate the scream came from the suydam stateroom and the sailor who broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not forthwith gone completely madas it is he shrieked more loudly than the first victims and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons the ships doctor who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did not go mad but told nobody what he saw till afterward when he corresponded with malone in chepachet it was murderstrangulationbut one need not say that the clawmark on mrs suydams throat could not have come from her husbands or any other human hand or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in hateful red a legend which later copied from memory seems to have been nothing less than the fearsome chaldee letters of the word lilith one need not mention these things because they vanished so quicklyas for suydam one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself the doctor has distinctly assured malone that he did not seeitthe open porthole just before he turned on the lights was clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence and for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering but no real outline met the eye as proof the doctor points to his continued sanitythen the tramp steamer claimed all attention a boat put off and a horde of swart insolent ruffians in officers dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted cunarder they wanted suydam or his bodythey had known of his trip and for certain reasons were sure he would die the captains deck was almost a pandemonium for at the instant between the doctors report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the tramp not even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners an arab with a hatefully negroid mouth pulled forth a dirty crumpled paper and handed it to the captain it was signed by robert suydam and bore the following odd messagein case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part please deliver me or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the bearer and his associates everything for me and perhaps for you depends on absolute compliance explanations can come laterdo not fail me nowrobert suydamcaptain and doctor looked at each other and the latter whispered something to the former finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the way to the suydam stateroom the doctor directed the captains glance away as he unlocked the door and admitted the strange seamen nor did he breathe easily till they filed out with their burden after an unaccountably long period of preparation it was wrapped in bedding from the berths and the doctor was glad that the outlines were not very revealing somehow the men got the thing over the side and away to their tramp steamer without uncovering it the cunarder started again and the doctor and a ships undertaker sought out the suydam stateroom to perform what last services they could once more the physician was forced to reticence and even to mendacity for a hellish thing had happened when the undertaker asked him why he had drained off all of mrs suydams blood he neglected to affirm that he had not done so nor did he point to the vacant bottlespaces on the rack or to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the bottles original contents the pockets of those menif men they werehad bulged damnably when they left the ship two hours later and the world knew by radio all that it ought to know of the horrible affairvithat same june evening without having heard a word from the sea malone was desperately busy among the alleys of red hook a sudden stir seemed to permeate the place and as if apprised by grapevine telegraph of something singular the denizens clustered expectantly around the dancehall church and the houses in parker place three children had just disappearedblueeyed norwegians from the streets toward gowanusand there were rumours of a mob forming among the sturdy vikings of that section malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt a general cleanup and at last moved by conditions more obvious to their common sense than the conjectures of a dublin dreamer they had agreed upon a final stroke the unrest and menace of this evening had been the deciding factor and just about midnight a raiding party recruited from three stations descended upon parker place and its environs doors were battered in stragglers arrested and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes mitres and other inexplicable devices much was lost in the melee for objects were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts and betraying odours deadened by the sudden kindling of pungent incense but spattered blood was everywhere and malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still risinghe wanted to be in several places at once and decided on suydams basement flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the dilapidated dancehall church the flat he thought must hold some clue to a cult of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the centre and leader and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms noted their vaguely charnel odour and examined the curious books instruments gold ingots and glassstoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and there once a lean blackandwhite cat edged between his feet and tripped him overturning at the same time a beaker half full of a red liquid the shock was severe and to this day malone is not certain of what he saw but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities then came the locked cellar door and the search for something to break it down a heavy stool stood near and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique panels a crack formed and enlarged and the whole door gave waybut from theotherside whence poured a howling tumult of icecold wind with all the stenches of the bottomless pit and whence reached a sucking force not of earth or heaven which coiling sentiently about the paralysed detective dragged him through the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with whispers and wails and gusts of mocking laughterof course it was a dream all the specialists have told him so and he has nothing to prove the contrary indeed he would rather have it thus for then the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul but at the time it was all horribly real and nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts those titan arcades and those halfformed shapes of hell that strode gigantically in silence holding halfeaten things whose still surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert and the black air was alive with the cloudy semivisible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes somewhere dark sticky water was lapping at onyx piers and once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent thing which swam into sight scrambled ashore and climbed up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the backgroundavenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction till one might fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence here cosmic sin had entered and festered by unhallowed rites had commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the graves holding satan here held his babylonish court and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent lilith were laved incubi and succubae howled praise to hecate and headless mooncalves bleated to the magna mater goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes and aegipans chased endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads moloch and ashtaroth were not absent for in this quintessence of all damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down and mans fancy lay open to vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to mould the world and nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed wells of night nor could any sign or prayer check the walpurgisriot of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemonloresuddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms and malone heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead a boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight made fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier and vomited forth several dark men bearing a long burden swathed in bedding they took it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the carved golden pedestal and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding then they unswathed it and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair the phosphorescent thing tittered again and the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its feet with red whilst they afterward gave the bottles to the thing to drink fromall at once from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away there came the daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ choking and rumbling out the mockeries of hell in a cracked sardonic bass in an instant every moving entity was electrified and forming at once into a ceremonial procession the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the soundgoat satyr and aegipan incubus succuba and lemur twisted toad and shapeless elemental dogfaced howler and silent strutter in darknessall led by the abominable naked phosphorescent thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne and that now strode insolently bearing in its arms the glassyeyed corpse of the corpulent old man the strange dark men danced in the rear and the whole column skipped and leaped with dionysiac fury malone staggered after them a few steps delirious and hazy and doubtful of his place in this or in any world then he turned faltered and sank down on the cold damp stone gasping and shivering as the daemon organ croaked on and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter and faintervaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him through the black arcade whilst eventually there rose the dreadful greek incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that dancehall churcho friend and companion of night thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs here a hideous howl burst forth and spilt blood here nameless sounds vied with morbid shriekings who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs here a whistling sigh occurred who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals short sharp cries from myriad throats gorgo repeated as response mormo repeated with ecstasy thousandfaced moon sighs and flute notes look favourably on our sacrificesas the chant closed a general shout went up and hissing sounds nearly drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ then a gasp as from many throats and a babel of barked and bleated wordslilith great lilith behold the bridegroom more cries a clamour of rioting and the sharp clicking footfalls of a running figure the footfalls approached and malone raised himself to his elbow to lookthe luminosity of the crypt lately diminished had now slightly increased and in that devillight there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee or feel or breathethe glassyeyed gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man now needing no support but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed after it raced the naked tittering phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal and still farther behind panted the dark men and all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses the corpse was gaining on its pursuers and seemed bent on a definite object straining with every rotting muscle toward the carved golden pedestal whose necromantic importance was evidently so great another moment and it had reached its goal whilst the trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed but they were too late for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution the staring corpse which had been robert suydam achieved its object and its triumph the push had been tremendous but the force had held out and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered tipped and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower tartarus in that instant too the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before malones eyes and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot out all the evil universeviimalones dream experienced in full before he knew of suydams death and transfer at sea was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case though that is no reason why anyone should believe it the three old houses in parker place doubtless long rotten with decay in its most insidious form collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners were inside and of both the greater number were instantly killed only in the basements and cellars was there much saving of life and malone was lucky to have been deep below the house of robert suydam for he really was there as no one is disposed to deny they found him unconscious by the edge of a nightblack pool with a grotesquely horrible jumble of decay and bone identifiable through dental work as the body of suydam a few feet away the case was plain for it was hither that the smugglers underground canal led and the men who took suydam from the ship had brought him home they themselves were never found or at least never identified and the ships doctor is not yet satisfied with the simple certitudes of the policesuydam was evidently a leader in extensive mansmuggling operations for the canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in the neighbourhood there was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the dancehall church a crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall and in whose chambers some singular and terrible things were discovered the croaking organ was there as well as a vast arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar the walls were lined with small cells in seventeen of whichhideous to relatesolitary prisoners in a state of complete idiocy were found chained including four mothers with infants of disturbingly strange appearance these infants died soon after exposure to the light a circumstance which the doctors thought rather merciful nobody but malone among those who inspected them remembered the sombre question of old delrioan sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae et an ex tali congressu proles nasci queatbefore the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged and yielded forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes the kidnapping epidemic very clearly had been traced home though only two of the surviving prisoners could by any legal thread be connected with it these men are now in prison since they failed of conviction as accessories in the actual murders the carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by malone as of primary occult importance was never brought to light though at one place under the suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging it was choked up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new houses were made but malone often speculates on what lies beneath the police satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous gang of maniacs and mansmugglers turned over to the federal authorities the unconvicted kurds who before their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the yezidi clan of devilworshippers the tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery though cynical detectives are once more ready to combat its smuggling and rumrunning ventures malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details and the suggestive obscurity of the whole case though he is just as critical of the newspapers which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated over a minor sadist cult which they might have proclaimed a horror from the universes very heart but he is content to rest silent in chepachet calming his nervous system and praying that time may gradually transfer his terrible experience from the realm of present reality to that of picturesque and semimythical remotenessrobert suydam sleeps beside his bride in greenwood cemetery no funeral was held over the strangely released bones and relatives are grateful for the swift oblivion which overtook the case as a whole the scholars connexion with the red hook horrors indeed was never emblazoned by legal proof since his death forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise have faced his own end is not much mentioned and the suydams hope that posterity may recall him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled in harmless magic and folkloreas for red hookit is always the same suydam came and went a terror gathered and faded but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on amongst the mongrels in the old brick houses and prowling bands still parade on unknown errands past windows where lights and twisted faces unaccountably appear and disappear ageold horror is a hydra with a thousand heads and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the well of democritus the soul of the beast is omnipresent and triumphant and red hooks legions of bleareyed pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl as they file from abyss to abyss none knows whence or whither pushed on by blind laws of biology which they may never understand as of old more people enter red hook than leave it on the landward side and there are already rumours of new canals running underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor and less mentionable thingsthe dancehall church is now mostly a dancehall and queer faces have appeared at night at the windows lately a policeman expressed the belief that the filledup crypt has been dug out again and for no simply explainable purpose

when the state highway to rutland is closed travellers are forced to take the stillwater road past swamp hollow the scenery is superb in places yet somehow the route has been unpopular for years there is something depressing about it especially near stillwater itself motorists feel subtly uncomfortable about the tightly shuttered farmhouse on the knoll just north of the village and about the whitebearded halfwit who haunts the old buryingground on the south apparently talking to the occupants of some of the gravesnot much is left of stillwater now the soil is played out and most of the people have drifted to the towns across the distant river or to the city beyond the distant hills the steeple of the old white church has fallen down and half of the twentyodd straggling houses are empty and in various stages of decay normal life is found only around pecks general store and fillingstation and it is here that the curious stop now and then to ask about the shuttered house and the idiot who mutters to the deadmost of the questioners come away with a touch of distaste and disquiet they find the shabby loungers oddly unpleasant and full of unnamed hints in speaking of the longpast events brought up there is a menacing portentous quality in the tones which they use to describe very ordinary eventsa seemingly unjustified tendency to assume a furtive suggestive confidential air and to fall into awesome whispers at certain pointswhich insidiously disturbs the listener old yankees often talk like that but in this case the melancholy aspect of the halfmouldering village and the dismal nature of the story unfolded give these gloomy secretive mannerisms an added significance one feels profoundly the quintessential horror that lurks behind the isolated puritan and his strange repressionsfeels it and longs to escape precipitately into clearer airthe loungers whisper impressively that the shuttered house is that of old miss spraguesophie sprague whose brother tom was buried on the seventeenth of june back in 86 sophie was never the same after that funeralthat and the other thing which happened the same dayand in the end she took to staying in all the time wont even be seen now but leaves notes under the backdoor mat and has her things brought from the store by ned pecks boy afraid of somethingthe old swamp hollow buryingground most of all never could be dragged near there since her brotherand the other onewere laid away not much wonder though seeing the way crazy johnny dow rants he hangs around the buryingground all day and sometimes at night and claims he talks with tomand the other then he marches by sophies house and shouts things at herthats why she began to keep the shutters closed he says things are coming from somewhere to get her sometime ought to be stopped but one cant be too hard on poor johnny besides steve barbour always had his opinionsjohnny does his talking to two of the graves one of them is tom spragues the other at the opposite end of the graveyard is that of henry thorndike who was buried on the same day henry was the village undertakerthe only one in milesand never liked around stillwater a city fellow from rutlandbeen to college and full of book learning read queer things nobody else ever heard of and mixed chemicals for no good purpose always trying to invent something newsome newfangled embalmingfluid or some foolish kind of medicine some folks said he had tried to be a doctor but failed in his studies and took to the next best profession of course there wasnt much undertaking to do in a place like stillwater but henry farmed on the sidemean morbid dispositionand a secret drinker if you could judge by the empty bottles in his rubbish heap no wonder tom sprague hated him and blackballed him from the masonic lodge and warned him off when he tried to make up to sophie the way he experimented on animals was against nature and scripture who could forget the state that collie dog was found in or what happened to old mrs akeleys cat then there was the matter of deacon leavitts calf when tom had led a band of the village boys to demand an accounting the curious thing was that the calf came alive after all in the end though tom had found it as stiff as a poker some said the joke was on tom but thorndike probably thought otherwise since he had gone down under his enemys fist before the mistake was discoveredtom of course was half drunk at the time he was a vicious brute at best and kept his poor sister half cowed with threats thats probably why she is such a fearracked creature still there were only the two of them and tom would never let her leave because that meant splitting the property most of the fellows were too afraid of him to shine up to sophiehe stood six feet one in his stockingsbut henry thorndike was a sly cuss who had ways of doing things behind folks backs he wasnt much to look at but sophie never discouraged him any mean and ugly as he was shed have been glad if anybody could have freed her from her brother she may not have stopped to wonder how she could get clear of him after he got her clear of tomwell that was the way things stood in june of 86 up to this point the whispers of the loungers at pecks store are not so unbearably portentous but as they continue the element of secretiveness and malign tension grows tom sprague it appears used to go to rutland on periodic sprees his absences being henry thorndikes great opportunities he was always in bad shape when he got back and old dr pratt deaf and half blind though he was used to warn him about his heart and about the danger of delirium tremens folks could always tell by the shouting and cursing when he was home againit was on the ninth of juneon a wednesday the day after young joshua goodenough finished building his newfangled silothat tom started out on his last and longest spree he came back the next tuesday morning and folks at the store saw him lashing his bay stallion the way he did when whiskey had a hold of him then there came shouts and shrieks and oaths from the sprague house and the first thing anybody knew sophie was running over to old dr pratts at top speedthe doctor found thorndike at spragues when he got there and tom was on the bed in his room with eyes staring and foam around his mouth old pratt fumbled around and gave the usual tests then shook his head solemnly and told sophie she had suffered a great bereavementthat her nearest and dearest had passed through the pearly gates to a better land just as everybody knew he would if he didnt let up on his drinkingsophie kind of sniffled the loungers whisper but didnt seem to take on much thorndike didnt do anything but smileperhaps at the ironic fact that he always an enemy was now the only person who could be of any use to thomas sprague he shouted something in old dr pratts halfgood ear about the need of having the funeral early on account of toms condition drunks like that were always doubtful subjects and any extra delaywith merely rural facilitieswould entail consequences visual and otherwise hardly acceptable to the deceaseds loving mourners the doctor had muttered that toms alcoholic career ought to have embalmed him pretty well in advance but thorndike assured him to the contrary at the same time boasting of his own skill and of the superior methods he had devised through his experimentsit is here that the whispers of the loungers grow acutely disturbing up to this point the story is usually told by ezra davenport or luther fry if ezra is laid up with chilblains as he is apt to be in winter but from there on old calvin wheeler takes up the thread and his voice has a damnably insidious way of suggesting hidden horror if johnny dow happens to be passing by there is always a pause for stillwater does not like to have johnny talk too much with strangerscalvin edges close to the traveller and sometimes seizes a coatlapel with his gnarled mottled hand while he half shuts his watery blue eyeswell sir he whispers henry he went home an got his undertakers fixinscrazy johnny dow lugged most of em for he was always doin chores for henryan says as doc pratt an crazy johnny should help lay out the body doc always did say as how he thought henry talked too muchaboastin what a fine workman he was an how lucky it was that stillwater had a reglar undertaker instead of buryin folks jest as they was like they do over to whitbysuppose says he some fellow was to be took with some of them paralysin cramps like you read about howd a body like it when they lowered him down and begun shovelin the dirt back howd he like it when he was chokin down there under the new headstone scratchin an tearin if he chanced to get back the power but all the time knowin it wasnt no use no sir i tell you its a blessin stillwaters got a smart doctor as knows when a mans dead and when he aint and a trained undertaker who can fix a corpse so hell stay put without no troublethat was the way henry went on talkin most like he was talkin to poor toms remains and old doc pratt he didnt like what he was able to catch of it even though henry did call him a smart doctor crazy johnny kept watchin of the corpse and it didnt make it none too pleasant the way hed slobber about things like he aint cold doc or i see his eyelids move or theres a hole in his arm jest like the ones i git when henry gives me a syringe full of what makes me feel good thorndike shut him up on that though we all knowed hed been givin poor johnny drugs its a wonder the poor fellow ever got clear of the habitbut the worst thing accordin to the doctor was the way the body jerked up when henry begun to shoot it full of embalminfluid hed been boastin about what a fine new formula hed got practicin on cats and dogs when all of a sudden toms corpse began to double up like it was alive and fixin to wrassle land of goshen but doc says he was scared stiff though he knowed the way corpses act when the muscles begin to stiffen well sir the long and short of it is that the corpse sat up an grabbed a holt of thorndikes syringe so that it got stuck in henry hisself an give him as neat a dose of his own embalminfluid as youd wish to see that got henry pretty scared though he yanked the point out and managed to get the body down again and shot full of the fluid he kept measurin more of the stuff out as though he wanted to be sure there was enough and kept reassurin himself as not much had got into him but crazy johnny begun singin out thats what you give lige hopkinss dog when it got all dead an stiff an then waked up agin now youre agoing to get dead an stiff like tom sprague be remember it dont set to work till after a long spell if you dont get muchsophie she was downstairs with some of the neighboursmy wife matildy she thats dead an gone this thirty year was one of them they were all tryin to find out whether thorndike was over when tom came home and whether findin him there was what set poor tom off i may as well say as some folks thought it mighty funny that sophie didnt carry on more nor mind the way thorndike had smiled not as anybody was hintin that henry helped tom off with some of his queer cookedup fluids and syringes or that sophie would keep still if she thought sobut you know how folks will guess behind a bodys back we all knowed the nigh crazy way thorndike had hated tomnot without reason at thatand emily barbour says to my matildy as how henry was lucky to have ol doc pratt right on the spot with a death certificate as didnt leave no doubt for nobodywhen old calvin gets to this point he usually begins to mumble indistinguishably in his straggling dirty white beard most listeners try to edge away from him and he seldom appears to heed the gesture it is generally fred peck who was a very small boy at the time of the events who continues the talethomas spragues funeral was held on thursday june 17th only two days after his death such haste was thought almost indecent in remote and inaccessible stillwater where long distances had to be covered by those who came but thorndike had insisted that the peculiar condition of the deceased demanded it the undertaker had seemed rather nervous since preparing the body and could be seen frequently feeling his pulse old dr pratt thought he must be worrying about the accidental dose of embalmingfluid naturally the story of the laying out had spread so that a double zest animated the mourners who assembled to glut their curiosity and morbid interestthorndike though he was obviously upset seemed intent on doing his professional duty in magnificent style sophie and others who saw the body were most startled by its utter lifelikeness and the mortuary virtuoso made doubly sure of his job by repeating certain injections at stated intervals he almost wrung a sort of reluctant admiration from the townsfolk and visitors though he tended to spoil that impression by his boastful and tasteless talk whenever he administered to his silent charge he would repeat that eternal rambling about the good luck of having a firstclass undertaker whathe would say as if directly addressing the bodyif tom had had one of those careless fellows who bury their subjects alive the way he harped on the horrors of premature burial was truly barbarous and sickeningservices were held in the stuffy best roomopened for the first time since mrs sprague died the tuneless little parlour organ groaned disconsolately and the coffin supported on trestles near the hall door was covered with sicklysmelling flowers it was obvious that a recordbreaking crowd was assembling from far and near and sophie endeavoured to look properly griefstricken for their benefit at unguarded moments she seemed both puzzled and uneasy dividing her scrutiny between the feverishlooking undertaker and the lifelike body of her brother a slow disgust at thorndike seemed to be brewing within her and neighbours whispered freely that she would soon send him about his business now that tom was out of the waythat is if she could for such a slick customer was sometimes hard to deal with but with her money and remaining looks she might be able to get another fellow and hed probably take care of henry well enoughas the organ wheezed intobeautiful isle of somewherethe methodist church choir added their lugubrious voices to the gruesome cacophony and everyone looked piously at deacon leavitteveryone that is except crazy johnny dow who kept his eyes glued to the still form beneath the glass of the coffin he was muttering softly to himselfstephen barbourfrom the next farmwas the only one who noticed johnny he shivered as he saw that the idiot was talking directly to the corpse and even making foolish signs with his fingers as if to taunt the sleeper beneath the plate glass tom he reflected had kicked poor johnny around on more than one occasion though probably not without provocation something about this whole event was getting on stephens nerves there was a suppressed tension and brooding abnormality in the air for which he could not account johnny ought not to have been allowed in the houseand it was curious what an effort thorndike seemed to be making not to look at the body every now and then the undertaker would feel his pulse with an odd airthe reverend silas atwood droned on in a plaintive monotone about the deceasedabout the striking of deaths sword in the midst of this little family breaking the earthly tie between this loving brother and sister several of the neighbours looked furtively at one another from beneath lowered eyelids while sophie actually began to sob nervously thorndike moved to her side and tried to reassure her but she seemed to shrink curiously away from him his motions were distinctly uneasy and he seemed to feel acutely the abnormal tension permeating the air finally conscious of his duty as master of ceremonies he stepped forward and announced in a sepulchral voice that the body might be viewed for the last timeslowly the friends and neighbours filed past the bier from which thorndike roughly dragged crazy johnny away tom seemed to be resting peacefully that devil had been handsome in his day a few genuine sobsand many feigned oneswere heard though most of the crowd were content to stare curiously and whisper afterward steve barbour lingered long and attentively over the still face and moved away shaking his head his wife emily following after him whispered that henry thorndike had better not boast so much about his work for toms eyes had come open they had been shut when the services began for she had been up and looked but they certainly looked naturalnot the way one would expect after two dayswhen fred peck gets this far he usually pauses as if he did not like to continue the listener too tends to feel that something unpleasant is ahead but peck reassures his audience with the statement that what happened isnt as bad as folks like to hint even steve never put into words what he may have thought and crazy johnny of course cant be counted at allit was luella morsethe nervous old maid who sang in the choirwho seems to have touched things off she was filing past the coffin like the rest but stopped to peer a little closer than anyone else except the barbours had peered and then without warning she gave a shrill scream and fell in a dead faintnaturally the room was at once a chaos of confusion old dr pratt elbowed his way to luella and called for some water to throw in her face and others surged up to look at her and at the coffin johnny dow began chanting to himself he knows he knows he kin hear all were asayin and see all were adoin and theyll bury him that waybut no one stopped to decipher his mumbling except steve barbourin a very few moments luella began to come out of her faint and could not tell exactly what had startled her all she could whisper was the way he lookedthe way he looked but to other eyes the body seemed exactly the same it was a gruesome sight though with those open eyes and that high colouringand then the bewildered crowd noticed something which put both luella and the body out of their minds for a moment it was thorndikeon whom the sudden excitement and jostling crowd seemed to be having a curiously bad effect he had evidently been knocked down in the general bustle and was on the floor trying to drag himself to a sitting posture the expression on his face was terrifying in the extreme and his eyes were beginning to take on a glazed fishy expression he could scarcely speak aloud but the husky rattle of his throat held an ineffable desperation which was obvious to allget me home quick and let me be that fluid i got in my arm by mistake heart action this damned excitement too much wait wait dont think im dead if i seem to only the fluidjust get me home and wait ill come to later dont know how long all the time ill be conscious and know whats going on dont be deceived as his words trailed off into nothingness old dr pratt reached him and felt his pulsewatching a long time and finally shaking his head no use doing anythinghes gone heart no goodand that fluid he got in his arm must have been bad stuff i dont know what it isa kind of numbness seemed to fall on all the company new death in the chamber of death only steve barbour thought to bring up thorndikes last choking words was he surely dead when he himself had said he might falsely seem so wouldnt it be better to wait a while and see what would happen and for that matter what harm would it do if doc pratt were to give tom sprague another looking over before burialcrazy johnny was moaning and had flung himself on thorndikes body like a faithful dog dont ye bury him dont ye bury him he aint dead no more nor lige hopkinss dog nor deacon leavitts calf was when he shot em full hes got some stuff he puts into ye to make ye seem like dead when ye aint ye seem like dead but ye know everything whats agoin on and the next day ye come to as good as ever dont ye bury himhell come to under the earth an he cant scratch up hes a good man an not like tom sprague hope to gawd tom scratches an chokes for hours an hours but no one save barbour was paying any attention to poor johnny indeed what steve himself had said had evidently fallen on deaf ears uncertainty was everywhere old doc pratt was applying final tests and mumbling about death certificate blanks and unctuous elder atwood was suggesting that something be done about a double interment with thorndike dead there was no undertaker this side of rutland and it would mean a terrible expense if one were to be brought from there and if thorndike were not embalmed in this hot june weatherwell one couldnt tell and there were no relatives or friends to be critical unless sophie chose to bebut sophie was on the other side of the room staring silently fixedly and almost morbidly into her brothers coffindeacon leavitt tried to restore a semblance of decorum and had poor thorndike carried across the hall to the sittingroom meanwhile sending zenas wells and walter perkins over to the undertakers house for a coffin of the right size the key was in henrys trousers pocket johnny continued to whine and paw at the body and elder atwood busied himself with inquiring about thorndikes denominationfor henry had not attended local services when it was decided that his folks in rutlandall dead nowhad been baptists the reverend silas decided that deacon leavitt had better offer the brief prayerit was a gala day for the funeralfanciers of stillwater and vicinity even luella had recovered enough to stay gossip murmured and whispered buzzed busily while a few composing touches were given to thorndikes cooling stiffening form johnny had been cuffed out of the house as most agreed he should have been in the first place but his distant howls were now and then wafted gruesomely inwhen the body was encoffined and laid out beside that of thomas sprague the silent almost frighteninglooking sophie gazed intently at it as she had gazed at her brothers she had not uttered a word for a dangerously long time and the mixed expression on her face was past all describing or interpreting as the others withdrew to leave her alone with the dead she managed to find a sort of mechanical speech but no one could make out the words and she seemed to be talking first to one body and then the otherand now with what would seem to an outsider the acme of gruesome unconscious comedy the whole funeral mummery of the afternoon was listlessly repeated again the organ wheezed again the choir screeched and scraped again a droning incantation arose and again the morbidly curious spectators filed past a macabre objectthis time a dual array of mortuary repose some of the more sensitive people shivered at the whole proceeding and again stephen barbour felt an underlying note of eldritch horror and daemoniac abnormality god how lifelike both of those corpses were and how in earnest poor thorndike had been about not wanting to be judged dead and how he hated tom sprague but what could one do in the face of common sensea dead man was a dead man and there was old doc pratt with his years of experience if nobody else bothered why should one bother oneself whatever tom had got he had probably deserved and if henry had done anything to him the score was even now well sophie was free at last as the peering procession moved at last toward the hall and the outer door sophie was alone with the dead once more elder atwood was out in the road talking to the hearsedriver from lees livery stable and deacon leavitt was arranging for a double quota of pallbearers luckily the hearse would hold two coffins no hurryed plummer and ethan stone were going ahead with shovels to dig the second grave there would be three livery hacks and any number of private rigs in the cavalcadeno use trying to keep the crowd away from the gravesthen came that frantic scream from the parlour where sophie and the bodies were its suddenness almost paralysed the crowd and brought back the same sensation which had surged up when luella had screamed and fainted steve barbour and deacon leavitt started to go in but before they could enter the house sophie was bursting forth sobbing and gasping about that face at the window that face at the window at the same time a wildeyed figure rounded the corner of the house removing all mystery from sophies dramatic cry it was very obviously the faces ownerpoor crazy johnny who began to leap up and down pointing at sophie and shrieking she knows she knows i seen it in her face when she looked at em and talked to em she knows and shes alettin em go down in the earth to scratch an claw for air but theyll talk to her sos she kin hear em theyll talk to her an appear to her and some day theyll come back an git herzenas wells dragged the shrieking halfwit to a woodshed behind the house and bolted him in as best he could his screams and poundings could be heard at a distance but nobody paid him any further attention the procession was made up and with sophie in the first hack it slowly covered the short distance past the village to the swamp hollow buryinggroundelder atwood made appropriate remarks as thomas sprague was laid to rest and by the time he was through ed and ethan had finished thorndikes grave on the other side of the cemeteryto which the crowd presently shifted deacon leavitt then spoke ornamentally and the lowering process was repeated people had begun to drift off in knots and the clatter of receding buggies and carryalls was quite universal when the shovels began to fly again as the earth thudded down on the coffinlids thorndikes first steve barbour noticed the queer expressions flitting over sophie spragues face he couldnt keep track of them all but behind the rest there seemed to lurk a sort of wry perverse halfsuppressed look of vague triumph he shook his headzenas had run back and let crazy johnny out of the woodshed before sophie got home and the poor fellow at once made frantically for the graveyard he arrived before the shovelmen were through and while many of the curious mourners were still lingering about what he shouted into tom spragues partly filled grave and how he clawed at the loose earth of thorndikes freshly finished mound across the cemetery surviving spectators still shudder to recall jotham blake the constable had to take him back to the town farm by force and his screams waked dreadful echoesthis is where fred peck usually leaves off the story what more he asks is there to tell it was a gloomy tragedy and one can scarcely wonder that sophie grew queer after that that is all one hears if the hour is so late that old calvin wheeler has tottered home but when he is still around he breaks in again with that damnably suggestive and insidious whisper sometimes those who hear him dread to pass either the shuttered house or the graveyard afterward especially after darkheh heh fred was only a little shaver then and dont remember no more than half of what was goin on you want to know why sophie keeps her house shuttered and why crazy johnny still keeps atalkin to the dead and ashoutin at sophies windows well sir i dont knows i know all there is to know but i hear what i hearhere the old man ejects his cud of tobacco and leans forward to buttonhole the listenerit was that same night mind yetoward mornin and just eight hours after them burialswhen we heard the first scream from sophies house woke us all upsteve and emily barbour and me and matildy goes over hotfootin all in night gear and finds sophie all dressed and dead fainted on the settinroom floor lucky she hadnt locked the door when we got her to she was shakin like a leaf and wouldnt let on by so much as a word what was ailin her matildy and emily done what they could to quiet her down but steve whispered things to me as didnt make me none too easy come about an hour when we allowed wed be goin home soon that sophie she begun to tip her head on one side like she was alistenin to somethin then on a sudden she screamed again and keeled over in another faintwell sir im tellin what im tellin and wont do no guessin like steve barbour would a done if he dared he always was the greatest hand for hintin things died ten years ago of pneumony what we heard so faintlike was just poor crazy johnny of course taint more than a mile to the buryinground and he must a got out of the window where theyd locked him up at the town farmeven if constable blake says he didnt get out that night from that day to this he hangs around them graves atalkin to the both of themcussin and kickin at toms mound and puttin posies and things on henrys and when he aint adoin that hes hangin around sophies shuttered windows howlin about whats acomin soon to git hershe wouldnt never go near the buryinground and now she wont come out of the house at all nor see nobody got to sayin there was a curse on stillwaterand im dinged if she aint half right the way things is agoin to pieces these days there certainly was somethin queer about sophie right along once when sally hopkins was acallin on herin 97 or 98 i think it wasthere was an awful rattlin at her windersand johnny was safe locked up at the timeat least so constable dodge swore up and down but i aint takin no stock in their stories about noises every seventeenth of june or about faint shinin figures atryin sophies door and winders every black mornin about two oclockyou see it was about two oclock in the mornin that sophie heard the sounds and keeled over twice that first night after the buryin steve and me and matildy and emily heard the second lot faint as it was just like i told you and im atellin you again as how it must a been crazy johnny over to the buryinground let jotham blake claim what he will there aint no tellin the sound of a mans voice so far off and with our heads full of nonsense it aint no wonder we thought there was two voicesand voices that hadnt ought to be speakin at allsteve he claimed to have heard more than i did i verily believe he took some stock in ghosts matildy and emily was so scared they didnt remember what they heard and curious enough nobody else in townif anybody was awake at the ungodly hournever said nothin about hearin no sounds at allwhatever it was was so faint it might have been the wind if there hadnt been words i made out a few but dont want to say as id back up all steve claimed to have caught shedevil all the time henry and alive was plain and so was you know said youd stand by get rid of him and bury me in a kind of changed voice then there was that awful comin again some dayin a deathlike squawk but you cant tell me johnny couldnt have made those sounds hey you whats takin you off in such a hurry mebbe theres more i could tell you if i had a mind,1
iit was languid curiosity which first brought stephen jones to rogers museum someone had told him about the queer underground place in southwark street across the river where waxen things so much more horrible than the worst effigies at madame tussauds were shewn and he had strolled in one april day to see how disappointing he would find it oddly he was not disappointed there was something different and distinctive here after all of course the usual gory commonplaces were presentlandru dr crippen madame demers rizzio lady jane grey endless maimed victims of war and revolution and monsters like gilles de rais and marquis de sadebut there were other things which had made him breathe faster and stay till the ringing of the closing bell the man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary mountebank there was imaginationeven a kind of diseased geniusin some of this stufflater he had learned about george rogers the man had been on the tussaud staff but some trouble had developed which led to his discharge there were aspersions on his sanity and tales of his crazy forms of secret worshipthough latterly his success with his own basement museum had dulled the edge of some criticisms while sharpening the insidious point of others teratology and the iconography of nightmare were his hobbies and even he had had the prudence to screen off some of his worst effigies in a special alcove for adults only it was this alcove which had fascinated jones so much there were lumpish hybrid things which only fantasy could spawn moulded with devilish skill and coloured in a horribly lifelike fashionsome were the figures of wellknown mythgorgons chimaeras dragons cyclops and all their shuddersome congeners others were drawn from darker and more furtively whispered cycles of subterranean legendblack formless tsathoggua manytentacled cthulhu proboscidian chaugnar faugn and other rumoured blasphemies from forbidden books like thenecronomiconthebook of eibonor theunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt but the worst were wholly original with rogers and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity had ever dared to suggest several were hideous parodies on forms of organic life we know while others seemed taken from feverish dreams of other planets and other galaxies the wilder paintings of clark ashton smith might suggest a fewbut nothing could suggest the effect of poignant loathsome terror created by their great size and fiendishly cunning workmanship and by the diabolically clever lighting conditions under which they were exhibitedstephen jones as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art had sought out rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the vaulted museum chamberan evillooking crypt lighted dimly by dusty windows set slitlike and horizontal in the brick wall on a level with the ancient cobblestones of a hidden courtyard it was here that the images were repairedhere too where some of them had been made waxen arms legs heads and torsos lay in grotesque array on various benches while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs ravenouslooking teeth and glassy staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered costumes of all sorts hung from hooks and in one alcove were great piles of fleshcoloured waxcakes and shelves filled with paintcans and brushes of every description in the centre of the room was a large meltingfurnace used to prepare the wax for moulding its firebox topped by a huge iron container on hinges with a spout which permitted the pouring of melted wax with the merest touch of a fingerother things in the dismal crypt were less describableisolated parts of problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of delirium at one end was a door of heavy plank fastened by an unusually large padlock and with a very peculiar symbol painted over it jones who had once had access to the dreadednecronomiconshivered involuntarily as he recognised that symbol this showman he reflected must indeed be a person of disconcertingly wide scholarship in dark and dubious fieldsnor did the conversation of rogers disappoint him the man was tall lean and rather unkempt with large black eyes which gazed combustively from a pallid and usually stubblecovered face he did not resent joness intrusion but seemed to welcome the chance of unburdening himself to an interested person his voice was of singular depth and resonance and harboured a sort of repressed intensity bordering on the feverish jones did not wonder that many had thought him madwith every successive calland such calls became a habit as the weeks went byjones had found rogers more communicative and confidential from the first there had been hints of strange faiths and practices on the showmans part and later on these hints expanded into talesdespite a few odd corroborative photographswhose extravagance was almost comic it was some time in june on a night when jones had brought a bottle of good whiskey and plied his host somewhat freely that the really demented talk first appeared before that there had been wild enough storiesaccounts of mysterious trips to thibet the african interior the arabian desert the amazon valley alaska and certain littleknown islands of the south pacific plus claims of having read such monstrous and halffabulous books as the prehistoric pnakotic fragments and the dhol chants attributed to malign and nonhuman lengbut nothing in all this had been so unmistakably insane as what had cropped out that june evening under the spell of the whiskeyto be plain rogers began making vague boasts of having found certain things in nature that no one had found before and of having brought back tangible evidences of such discoveries according to his bibulous harangue he had gone farther than anyone else in interpreting the obscure and primal books he studied and had been directed by them to certain remote places where strange survivals are hiddensurvivals of aeons and lifecycles earlier than mankind and in some cases connected with other dimensions and other worlds communication with which was frequent in the forgotten prehuman days jones marvelled at the fancy which could conjure up such notions and wondered just what rogers mental history had been had his work amidst the morbid grotesqueries of madame tussauds been the start of his imaginative flights or was the tendency innate so that his choice of occupation was merely one of its manifestations at any rate the mans work was very closely linked with his notions even now there was no mistaking the trend of his blackest hints about the nightmare monstrosities in the screenedoff adults only alcove heedless of ridicule he was trying to imply that not all of these daemoniac abnormalities were artificialit was joness frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible claims which broke up the growing cordiality rogers it was clear took himself very seriously for he now became morose and resentful continuing to tolerate jones only through a dogged urge to break down his wall of urbane and complacent incredulity wild tales and suggestions of rites and sacrifices to nameless elder gods continued and now and then rogers would lead his guest to one of the hideous blasphemies in the screenedoff alcove and point out features difficult to reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship jones continued his visits through sheer fascination though he knew he had forfeited his hosts regard at times he would try to humour rogers with pretended assent to some mad hint or assertion but the gaunt showman was seldom to be deceived by such tacticsthe tension came to a head later in september jones had casually dropped into the museum one afternoon and was wandering through the dim corridors whose horrors were now so familiar when he heard a very peculiar sound from the general direction of rogers workroom others heard it too and started nervously as the echoes reverberated through the great vaulted basement the three attendants exchanged odd glances and one of them a dark taciturn foreignlooking fellow who always served rogers as a repairer and assistant designer smiled in a way which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which grated very harshly on some facet of joness sensibilities it was the yelp or scream of a dog and was such a sound as could be made only under conditions of the utmost fright and agony combined its stark anguished frenzy was appalling to hear and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held a double hideousness jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the museumhe was about to go to the door leading into the workroom when the dark attendant stopped him with a word and a gesture mr rogers the man said in a soft somewhat accented voice at once apologetic and vaguely sardonic was out and there were standing orders to admit no one to the workroom during his absence as for that yelp it was undoubtedly something out in the courtyard behind the museum this neighbourhood was full of stray mongrels and their fights were sometimes shockingly noisy there were no dogs in any part of the museum but if mr jones wished to see mr rogers he might find him just before closingtimeafter this jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and examined the squalid neighbourhood curiously the leaning decrepit buildingsonce dwellings but now largely shops and warehouseswere very ancient indeed some of them were of a gabled type seeming to go back to tudor times and a faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the whole region beside the dingy house whose basement held the museum was a low archway pierced by a dark cobbled alley and this jones entered in a vague wish to find the courtyard behind the workroom and settle the affair of the dog more comfortably in his mind the courtyard was dim in the late afternoon light hemmed in by rear walls even uglier and more intangibly menacing than the crumbling street facades of the evil old houses not a dog was in sight and jones wondered how the aftermath of such a frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soondespite the assistants statement that no dog had been in the museum jones glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement workroomnarrow horizontal rectangles close to the grassgrown pavement with grimy panes that stared repulsively and incuriously like the eyes of dead fish to their left a worn flight of steps led to an opaque and heavily bolted door some impulse urged him to crouch low on the damp broken cobblestones and peer in on the chance that the thick green shades worked by long cords that hung down to a reachable level might not be drawn the outer surfaces were thick with dirt but as he rubbed them with his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring curtain in the way of his visionso shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made out but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up spectrally as jones tried each of the windows in turn it seemed evident at first that no one was within yet when he peered through the extreme righthand windowthe one nearest the entrance alleyhe saw a glow of light at the farther end of the apartment which made him pause in bewilderment there was no reason why any light should be there it was an inner side of the room and he could not recall any gas or electric fixture near that point another look defined the glow as a large vertical rectangle and a thought occurred to him it was in that direction that he had always noticed the heavy plank door with the abnormally large padlockthe door which was never opened and above which was crudely smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the fragmentary records of forbidden elder magic it must be open nowand there was a light inside all his former speculations as to where that door led and as to what lay behind it were now renewed with trebly disquieting forcejones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six oclock when he returned to the museum to make the call on rogers he could hardly tell why he wished so especially to see the man just then but there must have been some subconscious misgivings about that terribly unplaceable canine scream of the afternoon and about the glow of light in that disturbing and usually unopened inner doorway with the heavy padlock the attendants were leaving as he arrived and he thought that orabonathe dark foreignlooking assistanteyed him with something like sly repressed amusement he did not relish that lookeven though he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer many timesthe vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion but he strode quickly through it and rapped at the door of the office and workroom response was slow in coming though there were footsteps inside finally in response to a second knock the lock rattled and the ancient sixpanelled portal creaked reluctantly open to reveal the slouching feverisheyed form of george rogers from the first it was clear that the showman was in an unusual mood there was a curious mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome and his talk at once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible sortsurviving elder godsnameless sacrificesthe other than artificial nature of some of the alcove horrorsall the usual boasts but uttered in a tone of peculiarly increasing confidence obviously jones reflected the poor fellows madness was gaining on him from time to time rogers would send furtive glances toward the heavy padlocked inner door at the end of the room or toward a piece of coarse burlap on the floor not far from it beneath which some small object appeared to be lying jones grew more nervous as the moments passed and began to feel as hesitant about mentioning the afternoons oddities as he had formerly been anxious to do sorogers sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement of his fevered ramblingdo you remember he shouted what i told you about that ruined city in indochina where the tchotchos lived you had to admit id been there when you saw the photographs even if you did think i made that oblong swimmer in darkness out of wax if youd seen it writhing in the underground pools as i did well this is bigger still i never told you about this because i wanted to work out the later parts before making any claim when you see the snapshots youll know the geography couldnt have been faked and i fancy i have another way of proving thatitisnt any waxed concoction of mine youve never seen it for the experiments wouldnt let me keep it on exhibitionthe showman glanced queerly at the padlocked doorit all comes from that long ritual in the eighth pnakotic fragment when i got it figured out i saw it could have only one meaning there were things in the north before the land of lomarbefore mankind existedand this was one of them it took us all the way to alaska and up the noatak from fort morton but the thing was there as we knew it would be great cyclopean ruins acres of them there was less left than we had hoped for but after three million years what could one expect and werent the esquimau legends all in the right direction we couldnt get one of the beggars to go with us and had to sledge all the way back to nome for americans orabona was no good up in that climateit made him sullen and hatefulill tell you later how we found it when we got the ice blasted out of the pylons of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it would be some carvings still there and it was no trouble keeping the yankees from following us in orabona shivered like a leafyoud never think it from the damned insolent way he struts around here he knew enough of the elder lore to be properly afraid the eternal light was gone but our torches shewed enough we saw the bones of others who had been before usaeons ago when the climate was warm some of these bones were of things you couldnt even imagine at the third level down we found the ivory throne the fragments said so much aboutand i may as well tell you it wasnt emptythe thing on that throne didnt moveand we knew then that it needed the nourishment of sacrifice but we didnt want to wake it then better to get it to london first orabona and i went to the surface for the big box but when we had packed it we couldnt get it up the three flights of steps these steps werent made for human beings and their size bothered us anyway it was devilish heavy we had to have the americans down to get it out they werent anxious to go into the place but of course the worst thing was safely inside the box we told them it was a batch of ivory carvingsarchaeological stuff and after seeing the carved throne they probably believed us its a wonder they didnt suspect hidden treasure and demand a share they must have told queer tales around nome later on though i doubt if they ever went back to those ruins even for the ivory thronerogers paused felt around in his desk and produced an envelope of goodsized photographic prints extracting one and laying it face down before him he handed the rest to jones the set was certainly an odd one iceclad hills dog sledges men in furs and vast tumbled ruins against a background of snowruins whose bizarre outlines and enormous stone blocks could hardly be accounted for one flashlight view shewed an incredible interior chamber with wild carvings and a curious throne whose proportion could not have been designed for a human occupant the carvings on the gigantic masonryhigh walls and peculiar vaulting overheadwere mainly symbolic and involved both wholly unknown designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited in obscene legends over the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on the workroom wall above the padlocked plank door jones darted a nervous glance at the closed portal assuredly rogers had been to strange places and had seen strange things yet this mad interior picture might easily be a fraudtaken from a very clever stage setting one must not be too credulous but rogers was continuingwell we shipped the box from nome and got to london without any trouble that was the first time wed ever brought back anything that had a chance of coming alive i didnt put it on display because there were more important things to do for it it needed the nourishment of sacrifice for it was a god of course i couldnt get it the sort of sacrifices which it used to have in its day for such things dont exist now but there were other things which might do the blood is the life you know even the lemurs and elementals that are older than the earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the right conditionsthe expression on the narrators face was growing very alarming and repulsive so that jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair rogers seemed to notice his guests nervousness and continued with a distinctly evil smileit was last year that i got it and ever since then ive been trying rites and sacrifices orabona hasnt been much help for he was always against the idea of waking it he hates itprobably because hes afraid of what it will come to mean he carries a pistol all the time to protect himselffool as if there were human protection against it if i ever see him draw that pistol ill strangle him he wanted me to kill it and make an effigy of it but ive stuck by my plans and im coming out on top in spite of all the cowards like orabona and damned sniggering sceptics like you jones ive chanted the rites and made certain sacrificesand last week the transition camethe sacrifice wasreceived and enjoyedrogers actually licked his lips while jones held himself uneasily rigid the showman paused and rose crossing the room to the piece of burlap at which he had glanced so often bending down he took hold of one corner as he spoke againyouve laughed enough at my worknow its time for you to get some facts orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this afternoondo you know what that meantjones started for all his curiosity he would have been glad to get out without further light on the point which had so puzzled him but rogers was inexorable and began to lift the square of burlap beneath it lay a crushed almost shapeless mass which jones was slow to classify was it a onceliving thing which some agency had flattened sucked dry of blood punctured in a thousand places and wrung into a limp brokenboned heap of grotesqueness after a moment jones realised what it must be it was what was left of a doga dog perhaps of considerable size and whitish colour its breed was past recognition for distortion had come in nameless and hideous ways most of the hair was burned off as by some pungent acid and the exposed bloodless skin was riddled by innumerable circular wounds or incisions the form of torture necessary to cause such results was past imaginingelectrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust jones sprang up with a cryyou damned sadistyou madmanyou do a thing like this and dare to speak to a decent manrogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming guest his words held an unnatural calmwhy you fool do you thinkidid this let us admit that the results are unbeautiful from our limited human standpoint what of it it is not human and does not pretend to be to sacrifice is merely to offer i gave the dog toitwhat happened is its work not mine it needed the nourishment of the offering and took it in its own way but let me shew you what it looks likeas jones stood hesitating the speaker returned to his desk and took up the photograph he had laid face down without shewing now he extended it with a curious look jones took it and glanced at it in an almost mechanical way after a moment the visitors glance became sharper and more absorbed for the utterly satanic force of the object depicted had an almost hypnotic effect certainly rogers had outdone himself in modelling the eldritch nightmare which the camera had caught the thing was a work of sheer infernal genius and jones wondered how the public would react when it was placed on exhibition so hideous a thing had no right to existprobably the mere contemplation of it after it was done had completed the unhinging of its makers mind and led him to worship it with brutal sacrifices only a stout sanity could resist the insidious suggestion that the blasphemy wasor had once beensome morbid and exotic form of actual lifethe thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to be a clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other curious photograph to describe it with any ordinary vocabulary would be impossible for nothing even roughly corresponding to it has ever come within the imagination of sane mankind it represented something meant perhaps to be roughly connected with the vertebrates of this planetthough one could not be too sure of that its bulk was cyclopean for even squatted it towered to almost twice the height of orabona who was shewn beside it looking sharply one might trace its approximations toward the bodily features of the higher vertebratesthere was an almost globular torso with six long sinuous limbs terminating in crablike claws from the upper end a subsidiary globe bulged forward bubblelike its triangle of three staring fishy eyes its footlong and evidently flexible proboscis and a distended lateral system analogous to gills suggesting that it was a head most of the body was covered with what at first appeared to be fur but which on closer examination proved to be a dense growth of dark slender tentacles or sucking filaments each tipped with a mouth suggesting the head of an asp on the head and below the proboscis the tentacles tended to be longer and thicker and marked with spiral stripessuggesting the traditional serpentlocks of medusa to say that such a thing could have anexpressionseems paradoxical yet jones felt that that triangle of bulging fisheyes and that obliquely poised proboscis all bespoke a blend of hate greed and sheer cruelty incomprehensible to mankind because mixed with other emotions not of the world or this solar system into this bestial abnormality he reflected rogers must have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny sculptural genius the thing was incredibleand yet the photograph proved that it existedrogers interrupted his reverieswellwhat do you think of it now do you wonder what crushed the dog and sucked it dry with a million mouths it needed nourishmentand it will need more it is a god and i am the first priest of its latterday hierarchy i shubniggurath the goat with a thousand youngjones lowered the photograph in disgust and pitysee here rogers this wont do there are limits you know its a great piece of work and all that but it isnt good for you better not see it any morelet orabona break it up and try to forget about it and let me tear this beastly picture up toowith a snarl rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the deskidiotyouand you still think its all a fraud you still think i made it and you still think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax why damn you youre a worse clod than a wax image yourself but ive got proof this time and youre going to know not just now for it is resting after the sacrificebut later oh yesyou will not doubt the power of it thenas rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door jones retrieved his hat and stick from a nearby benchvery well rogers let it be later i must be going now but ill call around tomorrow afternoon think my advice over and see if it doesnt sound sensible ask orabona what he thinks toorogers actually bared his teeth in wildbeast fashionmust be going now eh afraid after all afraid for all your bold talk you say the effigies are only wax and yet you run away when i begin to prove that they arent youre like the fellows who take my standing bet that they darent spend the night in the museumthey come boldly enough but after an hour they shriek and hammer to get out want me to ask orabona eh you twoalways against me you want to break down the coming earthly reign of itjones preserved his calmno rogerstheres nobody against you and im not afraid of your figures either much as i admire your skill but were both a bit nervous tonight and i fancy some rest will do us goodagain rogers checked his guests departurenot afraid ehthen why are you so anxious to go look heredo you or dont you dare to stay alone here in the dark whats your hurry if you dont believe in itsome new idea seemed to have struck rogers and jones eyed him closelywhy ive no special hurrybut what would be gained by my staying here alone what would it prove my only objection is that it isnt very comfortable for sleeping what good would it do either of usthis time it was jones who was struck with an idea he continued in a tone of conciliationsee here rogersive just asked you what it would prove if i stayed when we both know it would prove that your effigies are just effigies and that you oughtnt to let your imagination go the way its been going lately suppose idostay if i stick it out till morning will you agree to take a new view of thingsgo on a vacation for three months or so and let orabona destroy that new thing of yours come nowisnt that fairthe expression on the showmans face was hard to read it was obvious that he was thinking quickly and that of sundry conflicting emotions malign triumph was getting the upper hand his voice held a choking quality as he repliedfair enoughif you do stick it outill take your advice but stick you must well go out for dinner and come back ill lock you in the display room and go home in the morning ill come down ahead of orabonahe comes half an hour before the restand see how you are but dont try it unless you areverysure of your scepticism others have backed outyou have that chance and i suppose a pounding on the outer door would always bring a constable you may not like it so well after a whileyoull be in the same building though not in the same room with itas they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard rogers took with him the piece of burlapweighted with a gruesome burden near the centre of the court was a manhole whose cover the showman lifted quietly and with a shuddersome suggestion of familiarity burlap and all the burden went down to the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth jones shuddered and almost shrank from the gaunt figure at his side as they emerged into the streetby unspoken mutual consent they did not dine together but agreed to meet in front of the museum at elevenjones hailed a cab and breathed more freely when he had crossed waterloo bridge and was approaching the brilliantly lighted strand he dined at a quiet caf and subsequently went to his home in portland place to bathe and get a few things idly he wondered what rogers was doing he had heard that the man had a vast dismal house in the walworth road full of obscure and forbidden books occult paraphernalia and wax images which he did not choose to place on exhibition orabona he understood lived in separate quarters in the same houseat eleven jones found rogers waiting by the basement door in southwark street their words were few but each seemed taut with a menacing tension they agreed that the vaulted exhibition room alone should form the scene of the vigil and rogers did not insist that the watcher sit in the special adult alcove of supreme horrors the showman having extinguished all the lights with switches in the workroom locked the door of that crypt with one of the keys on his crowded ring without shaking hands he passed out the street door locked it after him and stamped up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside as his tread receded jones realised that the long tedious vigil had commencediilater in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar jones cursed the childish naivet which had brought him there for the first halfhour he had kept flashing on his pocketlight at intervals but now just sitting in the dark on one of the visitors benches had become a more nerveracking thing every time the beam shot out it lighted up some morbid grotesque objecta guillotine a nameless hybrid monster a pastybearded face crafty with evil a body with red torrents streaming from a severed throat jones knew that no sinister reality was attached to these things but after that first halfhour he preferred not to see themwhy he had bothered to humour that madman he could scarcely imagine it would have been much simpler merely to have let him alone or to have called in a mental specialist probably he reflected it was the fellowfeeling of one artist for another there was so much genius in rogers that he deserved every possible chance to be helped quietly out of his growing mania any man who could imagine and construct the incredibly lifelike things that he had produced was surely not far from actual greatness he had the fancy of a sime or a dor joined to the minute scientific craftsmanship of a blatschka indeed he had done for the world of nightmare what the blatschkas with their marvellously accurate plant models of finely wrought and coloured glass had done for the world of botanyat midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the darkness and jones felt cheered by the message from a stillsurviving outside world the vaulted museum chamber was like a tombghastly in its utter solitude even a mouse would be cheering company yet rogers had once boasted thatfor certain reasons as he saidno mice or even insects ever came near the place that was very curious yet it seemed to be true the deadness and silence were virtually complete if only something would make a sound he shuffled his feet and the echoes came spectrally out of the absolute stillness he coughed but there was something mocking in the staccato reverberations he could not he vowed begin talking to himself that meant nervous disintegration time seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting slowness he could have sworn that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on his watch yet here was only the stroke of midnighthe wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen something in the darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them so that they responded to faint intimations hardly strong enough to be called true impressions his ears seemed at times to catch a faint elusive susurrus which could notquitebe identified with the nocturnal hum of the squalid streets outside and he thought of vague irrelevant things like the music of the spheres and the unknown inaccessible life of alien dimensions pressing on our own rogers often speculated about such thingsthe floating specks of light in his blacknessdrowned eyes seemed inclined to take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion he had often wondered about those strange rays from the unplumbed abyss which scintillate before us in the absence of all earthly illumination but he had never known any that behaved just as these were behaving they lacked the restful aimlessness of ordinary lightspeckssuggesting some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial conceptionthen there was that suggestion of odd stirrings nothing was open yet in spite of the general draughtlessness jones felt that the air was not uniformly quiet there were intangible variations in pressurenot quite decided enough to suggest the loathsome pawings of unseen elementals it was abnormally chilly too he did not like any of this the air tasted salty as if it were mixed with the brine of dark subterrene waters and there was a bare hint of some odour of ineffable mustiness in the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures had an odour even now that halfreceived hint was not the way wax figures ought to smell it was more like the faint smell of specimens in a naturalhistory museum curious in view of rogers claims that his figures were not all artificialindeed it was probably that claim which made ones imagination conjure up the olfactory suspicion one must guard against excesses of the imaginationhad not such things driven poor rogers madbut the utter loneliness of this place was frightful even the distant chimes seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs it made jones think of that insane picture which rogers had shewed himthe wildly carved chamber with the cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed was part of a threemillionyearold ruin in the shunned and inaccessible solitudes of the arctic perhaps rogers had been to alaska but that picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery it couldnt normally be otherwise with all that carving and those terrible symbols and that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that thronewhat a flight of diseased fancy jones wondered just how far he actually was from the insane masterpiece in waxprobably it was kept behind that heavy padlocked plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom but it would never do to brood about a waxen image was not the present room full of such things some of them scarcely less horrible than the dreadful it and beyond a thin canvas screen on the left was the adults only alcove with its nameless phantoms of deliriumthe proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on joness nerves more and more as the quarterhours wore on he knew the museum so well that he could not get rid of their usual images even in the total darkness indeed the darkness had the effect of adding to the remembered images certain very disturbing imaginative overtones the guillotine seemed to creak and the bearded face of landruslayer of his fifty wivestwisted itself into expressions of monstrous menace from the severed throat of madame demers a hideous bubbling sound seemed to emanate while the headless legless victim of a trunk murder tried to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps jones began shutting his eyes to see if that would dim the images but found it was useless besides when he shut his eyes the strange purposeful patterns of lightspecks became more disturbingly pronouncedthen suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had formerly been trying to banish he tried to keep them because they were giving place to still more hideous ones in spite of himself his memory began reconstructing the utterly nonhuman blasphemies that lurked in the obscurer corners and these lumpish hybrid growths oozed and wriggled toward him as though hunting him down in a circle black tsathoggua moulded itself from a toadlike gargoyle to a long sinuous line with hundreds of rudimentary feet and a lean rubbery nightgaunt spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher jones braced himself to keep from screaming he knew he was reverting to the traditional terrors of his childhood and resolved to use his adult reason to keep the phantoms at bay it helped a bit he found to flash the light again frightful as were the images it shewed these were not as bad as what his fancy called out of the utter blacknessbut there were drawbacks even in the light of his torch he could not help suspecting a slight furtive trembling on the part of the canvas partition screening off the terrible adults only alcove he knew what lay beyond and shivered imagination called up the shocking form of fabulous yogsothothonly a congeries of iridescent globes yet stupendous in its malign suggestiveness what was this accursed mass slowly floating toward him and bumping on the partition that stood in the way a small bulge in the canvas far to the right suggested the sharp horn of gnophkeh the hairy myththing of the greenland ice that walked sometimes on two legs sometimes on four and sometimes on six to get this stuff out of his head jones walked boldly toward the hellish alcove with torch burning steadily of course none of his fears was true yet were not the long facial tentacles of great cthulhu actually swaying slowly and insidiously he knew they were flexible but he had not realised that the draught caused by his advance was enough to set them in motionreturning to his former seat outside the alcove he shut his eyes and let the symmetrical lightspecks do their worst the distant clock boomed a single stroke could it be only one he flashed the light on his watch and saw that it was precisely that hour it would be hard indeed waiting for morning rogers would be down at about eight oclock ahead of even orabona it would be light outside in the main basement long before that but none of it could penetrate here all the windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three small ones facing the court a pretty bad wait all toldhis ears were getting most of the hallucinations nowfor he could swear he heard stealthy plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the closed and locked door he had no business thinking of that unexhibited horror which rogers called it the thing was a contaminationit had driven its maker mad and now even its picture was calling up imaginative terrors it could not be in the workroomit was very obviously beyond that padlocked door of heavy planking those steps were certainly pure imaginationthen he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door flashing on his torch he saw nothing but the ancient sixpanelled portal in its proper position again he tried darkness and closed eyes but there followed a harrowing illusion of creakingnot the guillotine this time but the slow furtive opening of the workroom door he would not scream once he screamed he would be lost there was a sort of padding or shuffling audible now and it was slowly advancing toward him he must retain command of himself had he not done so when the nameless brainshapes tried to close in on him the shuffling crept nearer and his resolution failed he did not scream but merely gulped out a challengewho goes there who are you what do you wantthere was no answer but the shuffling kept on jones did not know which he feared most to doturn on his flashlight or stay in the dark while the thing crept upon him this thing was different he felt profoundly from the other terrors of the evening his fingers and throat worked spasmodically silence was impossible and the suspense of utter blackness was beginning to be the most intolerable of all conditions again he cried out hystericallyhalt who goes thereas he switched on the revealing beams of his torch then paralysed by what he saw he dropped the flashlight and screamednot once but many timesshuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic blasphemous form of a black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect its hide hung loosely upon its frame and its rugose deadeyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly from side to side its fore paws were extended with talons spread wide and its whole body was taut with murderous malignity despite its utter lack of facial expression after the screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped and in a moment had jones pinned to the floor there was no struggle for the watcher had faintedjoness fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment for the nameless thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he began recovering consciousness what started him fully awake were the sounds which the thing was makingor rather the voice with which it was making them that voice was human and it was familiar only one living being could be behind the hoarse feverish accents which were chanting to an unknown horrori i it was howling i am coming o rhantegoth coming with the nourishment you have waited long and fed ill but now you shall have what was promised that and more for instead of orabona it will be one of high degree who had doubted you you shall crush and drain him with all his doubts and grow strong thereby and ever after among men he shall be shewn as a monument to your glory rhantegoth infinite and invincible i am your slave and highpriest you are hungry and i provide i read the sign and have led you forth i shall feed you with blood and you shall feed me with power i shubniggurath the goat with a thousand youngin an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from jones like a discarded cloak he was again master of his mind for he knew the very earthly and material peril he had to deal with this was no monster of fable but a dangerous madman it was rogers dressed in some nightmare covering of his own insane designing and about to make a frightful sacrifice to the devilgod he had fashioned out of wax clearly he must have entered the workroom from the rear courtyard donned his disguise and then advanced to seize his neatly trapped and fearbroken victim his strength was prodigious and if he was to be thwarted one must act quickly counting on the madmans confidence in his unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise while his grasp was relatively lax the feel of a threshold told him he was crossing into the pitchblack workroomwith the strength of mortal fear jones made a sudden spring from the halfrecumbent posture in which he was being dragged for an instant he was free of the astonished maniacs hands and in another instant a lucky lunge in the dark had put his own hands at his captors weirdly concealed throat simultaneously rogers gripped him again and without further preliminaries the two were locked in a desperate struggle of life and death joness athletic training without doubt was his sole salvation for his mad assailant freed from every inhibition of fair play decency or even selfpreservation was an engine of savage destruction as formidable as a wolf or pantherguttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark blood spurted clothing ripped and jones at last felt the actual throat of the maniac shorn of its spectral mask he spoke not a word but put every ounce of energy into the defence of his life rogers kicked gouged butted bit clawed and spatyet found strength to yelp out actual sentences at times most of his speech was in a ritualistic jargon full of references to it or rhantegoth and to joness overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries echoed from an infinite distance of daemoniac snortings and bayings toward the last they were rolling on the floor overturning benches or striking against the walls and the brick foundations of the central meltingfurnace up to the very end jones could not be certain of saving himself but chance finally intervened in his favour a jab of his knee against rogers chest produced a general relaxation and a moment later he knew he had wonthough hardly able to hold himself up jones rose and stumbled about the walls seeking the lightswitchfor his flashlight was gone together with most of his clothing as he lurched along he dragged his limp opponent with him fearing a sudden attack when the madman came to finding the switchbox he fumbled till he had the right handle then as the wildly disordered workroom burst into sudden radiance he set about binding rogers with such cords and belts as he could easily find the fellows disguiseor what was left of itseemed to be made of a puzzlingly queer sort of leather for some reason it made joness flesh crawl to touch it and there seemed to be an alien rusty odour about it in the normal clothes beneath it was rogers keyring and this the exhausted victor seized as his final passport to freedom the shades at the small slitlike windows were all securely drawn and he let them remain sowashing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink jones donned the most ordinarylooking and least illfitting clothes he could find on the costume hooks testing the door to the courtyard he found it fastened with a springlock which did not require a key from the inside he kept the keyring however to admit him on his return with aidfor plainly the thing to do was to call in an alienist there was no telephone in the museum but it would not take long to find an allnight restaurant or chemists shop where one could be had he had almost opened the door to go when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the room told him that rogerswhose visible injuries were confined to a long deep scratch down the left cheekhad regained consciousnessfool spawn of nothyidik and effluvium of kthun son of the dogs that howl in the maelstrom of azathoth you would have been sacred and immortal and now you are betraying it and its priest bewarefor it is hungry it would have been orabonathat

great is rhantegoth let me go let me go it is starving down there beyond that door and if it dies the old ones can never come back hei hei let me gojones merely shook his head though the hideousness of the showmans imaginings revolted him rogers now staring wildly at the padlocked plank door thumped his head again and again against the brick wall and kicked with his tightly bound ankles jones was afraid he would injure himself and advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary object writhing rogers edged away from him and set up a series of frenetic ululations whose utter monstrous unhumanness was appalling and whose sheer volume was almost incredible it seemed impossible that any human throat could produce noises so loud and piercing and jones felt that if this continued there would be no need to telephone for aid it could not be long before a constable would investigate even granting that there were no listening neighbours in this deserted warehouse districtwzayei wzayeihowled the madmanykaa haa bhoii rhantegothcthulhu fhtagnei ei ei eirhantegoth rhantegoth rhantegoththe tautly trussed creature who had started squirming his way across the littered floor now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced knocking his head thunderously against it jones dreaded the task of binding him further and wished he were not so exhausted from the previous struggle this violent aftermath was getting hideously on his nerves and he began to feel a return of the nameless qualms he had felt in the dark everything about rogers and his museum was so hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life it was loathsome to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which must at this very moment be lurking close at hand in the blackness beyond the heavy padlocked doorand now something happened which sent an additional chill down joness spine and caused every haireven the tiny growth on the backs of his handsto bristle with a vague fright beyond classification rogers had suddenly stopped screaming and beating his head against the stout plank door and was straining up to a sitting posture head cocked on one side as if listening intently for something all at once a smile of devilish triumph overspread his face and he began speaking intelligibly againthis time in a hoarse whisper contrasting oddly with his former stentorian howlinglisten fool listen hardithas heard me and is coming cant you hear it splashing out of its tank down there at the end of the runway i dug it deep because there was nothing too good for it it is amphibious you knowyou saw the gills in the picture it came to the earth from leadgrey yuggoth where the cities are under the warm deep sea it cant stand up in theretoo tallhas to sit or crouch let me get my keyswe must let it out and kneel down before it then we will go out and find a dog or cator perhaps a drunken manto give it the nourishment it needsit was not what the madman said but the way he said it that disorganised jones so badly the utter insane confidence and sincerity in that crazed whisper were damnably contagious imagination with such a stimulus could find an active menace in the devilish wax figure that lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking eyeing the door in unholy fascination jones noticed that it bore several distinct cracks though no marks of violent treatment were visible on this side he wondered how large a room or closet lay behind it and how the waxen figure was arranged the maniacs idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all his other imaginingsthen in one terrible instant jones completely lost the power to draw a breath the leather belt he had seized for rogers further strapping fell from his limp hands and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from head to foot he might have known the place would drive him mad as it had driven rogersand now hewasmad he was mad for he now harboured hallucinations more weird than any which had assailed him earlier that night the madman was bidding him hear the splashing of a mythical monster in a tank beyond the doorand now god help himhe did hear itrogers saw the spasm of horror reach joness face and transform it to a staring mask of fear he cackledat last fool you believe at last you know you hear it and it comes get me my keys foolwe must do homage and serve itbut jones was past paying attention to any human words mad or sane phobic paralysis held him immobile and halfconscious with wild images racing phantasmagorically through his helpless imagination therewasa splashing therewasa padding or shuffling as of great wet paws on a solid surface somethingwasapproaching into his nostrils from the cracks in that nightmare plank door poured a noisome animal stench like and yet unlike that of the mammal cages at the zological gardens in regents parkhe did not know now whether rogers was talking or not everything real had faded away and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations so unnatural that they became almost objective and remote from him he thought he heard a sniffing or snorting from the unknown gulf beyond the door and when a sudden baying trumpeting noise assailed his ears he could not feel sure that it came from the tightly bound maniac whose image swam uncertainly in his shaken vision the photograph of that accursed unseen wax thing persisted in floating through his consciousness such a thing had no right to exist had it not driven him madeven as he reflected a fresh evidence of madness beset him something he thought was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door it was patting and pawing and pushing at the planks there was a thudding on the stout wood which grew louder and louder the stench was horrible and now the assault on that door from the inside was a malign determined pounding like the strokes of a batteringram there was an ominous crackinga splinteringa welling foetora falling planka black paw ending in a crablike claw help help god help me aaaaaaa with intense effort jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of his fearparalysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight what he evidently did must have paralleled curiously the wild plunging flights of maddest nightmares for he seems to have leaped across the disordered crypt at almost a single bound yanked open the outside door which closed and locked itself after him with a clatter sprung up the worn stone steps three at a time and raced frantically and aimlessly out of that dank cobblestoned court and through the squalid streets of southwarkhere the memory ends jones does not know how he got home and there is no evidence of his having hired a cab probably he raced all the way by blind instinctover waterloo bridge along the strand and charing cross and up haymarket and regent street to his own neighbourhood he still had on the queer mlange of museum costumes when he grew conscious enough to call the doctora week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and walk in the open airbut he had not told the specialists much over his whole experience hung a pall of madness and nightmare and he felt that silence was the only course when he was up he scanned intently all the papers which had accumulated since that hideous night but found no reference to anything queer at the museum how much after all had been reality where did reality end and morbid dream begin had his mind gone wholly to pieces in that dark exhibition chamber and had the whole fight with rogers been a phantasm of fever it would help to put him on his feet if he could settle some of these maddening points hemusthave seen that damnable photograph of the wax image called it for no brain but rogers could ever have conceived such a blasphemyit was a fortnight before he dared to enter southwark street again he went in the middle of the morning when there was the greatest amount of sane wholesome activity around the ancient crumbling shops and warehouses the museums sign was still there and as he approached he saw that the place was open the gateman nodded in a pleasant recognition as he summoned up the courage to enter and in the vaulted chamber below an attendant touched his cap cheerfully perhaps everything had been a dream would he dare to knock at the door of the workroom and look for rogersthen orabona advanced to greet him his dark sleek face was a trifle sardonic but jones felt that he was not unfriendly he spoke with a trace of accentgood morning mr jones it is some time since we have seen you here did you wish mr rogers im sorry but he is away he had word of business in america and had to go yes it was very sudden i am in charge nowhere and at the house i try to maintain mr rogers high standardtill he is backthe foreigner smiledperhaps from affability alone jones scarcely knew how to reply but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the day after his last visit orabona seemed greatly amused by the questions and took considerable care in framing his repliesoh yes mr jonesthe twentyeighth of last month i remember it for many reasons in the morningbefore mr rogers got here you understandi found the workroom in quite a mess there was a great deal ofcleaning upto do there had beenlate work you see important new specimen given its secondary baking process i took complete charge when i cameit was a hard specimen to preparebut of course mr rogers has taught me a great deal he is as you know a very great artist when he came he helped me complete the specimenhelped very materially i assure youbut he left soon without even greeting the men as i tell you he was called away suddenly there were important chemical reactions involved they made loud noisesin fact some teamsters in the court outside fancy they heard several pistol shotsvery amusing ideaas for the new specimenthat matter is very unfortunate it is a great masterpiecedesigned and made you understand by mr rogers he will see about it when he gets backagain orabona smiledthe police you know we put it on display a week ago and there were two or three faintings one poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front of it you see it is a triflestrongerthan the rest larger for one thing of course it was in the adult alcove the next day a couple of men from scotland yard looked it over and said it was too morbid to be shewn said wed have to remove it it was a tremendous shamesuch a masterpiece of artbut i didnt feel justified in appealing to the courts in mr rogers absence he would not like so much publicity with the police nowbut when he gets backwhen he gets backfor some reason or other jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and repulsion but orabona was continuingyou are a connoisseur mr jones i am sure i violate no law in offering you a private view it may besubject of course to mr rogers wishesthat we shall destroy the specimen some daybut that would be a crimejones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee precipitately but orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an artists enthusiasm the adult alcove crowded with nameless horrors held no visitors in the farther corner a large niche had been curtained off and to this the smiling assistant advancedyou must know mr jones that the title of this specimen is the sacrifice to rhantegothjones started violently but orabona appeared not to noticethe shapeless colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends which mr rogers has studied all nonsense of course as youve so often assured mr rogers it is supposed to have come from outer space and to have lived in the arctic three million years ago it treated its sacrifices rather peculiarly and horribly as you shall see mr rogers had made it fiendishly lifelikeeven to the face of the victimnow trembling violently jones clung to the brass railing in front of the curtained niche he almost reached out to stop orabona when he saw the curtain beginning to swing aside but some conflicting impulse held him back the foreigner smiled triumphantlybeholdjones reeled in spite of his grip on the railinggodgreat godfully ten feet high despite a shambling crouching attitude expressive of infinite cosmic malignancy a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was shewn starting forward from a cyclopean ivory throne covered with grotesque carvings in the central pair of its six legs it bore a crushed flattened distorted bloodless thing riddled with a million punctures and in places seared as with some pungent acid only the mangled head of the victim lolling upside down at one side revealed that it represented something once humanthe monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain hellish photograph that damnable print had been all too faithful yet it could not carry the full horror which lay in the gigantic actuality the globular torsothe bubblelike suggestion of a headthe three fishy eyesthe footlong proboscisthe bulging gillsthe monstrous capillation of asplike suckersthe six sinuous limbs with their black paws and crablike clawsgod the familiarity of that black paw ending in a crablike claw orabonas smile was utterly damnable jones choked and stared at the hideous exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and disturbed him what halfrevealed horror was holding and forcing him to look longer and search out details this had driven rogers mad rogers supreme artist said they werent artificial then he localised the thing that held him it was the crushed waxen victims lolling head and something that it implied this head was not entirely devoid of a face and that face was familiar it was like the mad face of poor rogers jones peered closer hardly knowing why he was driven to do so wasnt it natural for a mad egotist to mould his own features into his masterpiece was there anything more that subconscious vision had seized on and suppressed in sheer terrorthe wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity those punctureshow perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds somehow inflicted on that poor dog but there was something more on the left cheek one could trace an irregularity which seemed outside the general schemeas if the sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of his first modelling the more jones looked at it the more mysteriously it horrified himand then suddenly he remembered a circumstance which brought his horror to a head that night of hideousnessthe tusslethe bound madmanand the long deep scratch down the left cheek of the actual living rogers jones releasing his desperate clutch on the railing sank in a total faintorabona continued to smile,1

intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui the enigmas of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the preraphaelites all were ours in their time but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal only the sombre philosophy of the decadents could hold us and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations baudelaire and huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures it was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear i mention with shame and timiditythat hideous extremity of human outrage the abhorred practice of graverobbingi cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the great stone house where we jointly dwelt alone and servantless our museum was a blasphemous unthinkable place where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and decay to excite our jaded sensibilities it was a secret room far far underground where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings through these pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined eastern shrines of the kingly dead and sometimeshow i shudder to recall itthe frightful soulupheaving stenches of the uncovered gravearound the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermists art and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution there one might find the rotting bald pates of famous noblemen and the fresh and radiantly golden heads of newburied children statues and paintings there were all of fiendish subjects and some executed by st john and myself a locked portfolio bound in tanned human skin held certain unknown and unnamable drawings which it was rumoured goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge there were nauseous musical instruments stringed brass and woodwind on which st john and i sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of tombloot ever assembled by human madness and perversity it is of this loot in particular that i must not speakthank god i had the courage to destroy it long before i thought of destroying myselfthe predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events we were no vulgar ghouls but worked only under certain conditions of mood landscape environment weather season and moonlight these pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression and we gave their details a fastidious technical care an inappropriate hour a jarring lighting effect or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous grinning secret of the earth our quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiatest john was always the leader and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking that accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doomby what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible holland churchyard i think it was the dark rumour and legendry the tales of one buried for five centuries who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre i can recall the scene in these final momentsthe pale autumnal moon over the graves casting long horrible shadows the grotesque trees drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky the phosphorescent insects that danced like deathfires under the yews in a distant corner the odours of mould vegetation and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the nightwind from over far swamps and seas and worst of all the faint deeptoned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place as we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered remembering the tales of the peasantry for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this selfsame spot torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beasti remembered how we delved in this ghouls grave with our spades and how we thrilled at the picture of ourselves the grave the pale watching moon the horrible shadows the grotesque trees the titanic bats the antique church the dancing deathfires the sickening odours the gently moaning nightwind and the strange halfheard directionless baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould and beheld a rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long undisturbed ground it was incredibly tough and thick but so old that we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it heldmuchamazingly muchwas left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred years the skeleton though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had killed it held together with surprising firmness and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long firm teeth and its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our own in the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design which had apparently been worn around the sleepers neck it was the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound or sphinx with a semicanine face and was exquisitely carved in antique oriental fashion from a small piece of green jade the expression on its features was repellent in the extreme savouring at once of death bestiality and malevolence around the base was an inscription in characters which neither st john nor i could identify and on the bottom like a makers seal was graven a grotesque and formidable skullimmediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred the ghastly soulsymbol of the corpseeating cult of inaccessible leng in central asia all too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old arab daemonologist lineaments he wrote drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the deadseizing the green jade object we gave a last glance at the bleached and caverneyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it as we hastened from that abhorrent spot the stolen amulet in st johns pocket we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment but the autumn moon shone weak and pale and we could not be sure so too as we sailed the next day away from holland to our home we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background but the autumn wind moaned sad and wan and we could not be sureiiless than a week after our return to england strange things began to happen we lived as recluses devoid of friends alone and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manorhouse on a bleak and unfrequented moor so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor now however we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night not only around the doors but around the windows also upper as well as lower once we fancied that a large opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off on each occasion investigation revealed nothing and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alonethat same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the holland churchyard the jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum and sometimes we burned strangely scented candles before it we read much in alhazredsnecronomiconabout its properties and about the relation of ghouls souls to the objects it symbolised and were disturbed by what we read then terror cameon the night of september 24 19 i heard a knock at my chamber door fancying it st johns i bade the knocker enter but was answered only by a shrill laugh there was no one in the corridor when i aroused st john from his sleep he professed entire ignorance of the event and became as worried as i it was that night that the faint distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality four days later whilst we were both in the hidden museum there came a low cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase our alarm was now divided for besides our fear of the unknown we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered extinguishing all lights we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air and heard as if receding far away a queer combination of rustling tittering and articulate chatter whether we were mad dreaming or in our senses we did not try to determine we only realised with the blackest of apprehensions that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubtin the dutch languageafter that we lived in growing horror and fascination mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the windswept moor always louder and louder on october 29 we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible to describe they were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old manorhouse in unprecedented and increasing numbersthe horror reached a culmination on november 18 when st john walking home after dark from the distant railway station was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons his screams had reached the house and i had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon my friend was dying when i spoke to him and he could not answer coherently all he could do was to whisper the amuletthat damned thing then he collapsed an inert mass of mangled fleshi buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens and mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life and as i pronounced the last daemoniac sentence i heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound the moon was up but i dared not look at it and when i saw on the dimlitten moor a wide nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound i shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground when i arose trembling i know not how much later i staggered into the house and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jadebeing now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor i departed on the following day for london taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum but after three nights i heard the baying again and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water a wind stronger than the nightwind rushed by and i knew that what had befallen st john must soon befall methe next day i carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for holland what mercy i might gain by returning the thing to its silent sleeping owner i knew not but i felt that i must at least try any step conceivably logical what the hound was and why it pursued me were questions still vague but i had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard and every subsequent event including st johns dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the amulet accordingly i sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when at an inn in rotterdam i discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means of salvationthe baying was loud that evening and in the morning i read of a nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city the rabble were in terror for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighbourhood in a squalid thieves den an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace and those around had heard all night above the usual clamour of drunken voices a faint deep insistent note as of a gigantic houndso at last i stood again in that unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the withered frosty grass and cracking slabs and the ivied church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky and the nightwind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas the baying was very faint now and it ceased altogether as i approached the ancient grave i had once violated and frightened away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around iti know not why i went thither unless to pray or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within but whatever my reason i attacked the halffrozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself excavation was much easier than i expected though at one point i encountered a queer interruption when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the graveearth until i killed him with a blow of my spade finally i reached the rotting oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover this is the last rational act i ever performedfor crouched within that centuried coffin embraced by a closepacked nightmare retinue of huge sinewy sleeping bats was the bony thing my friend and i had robbed not clean and placid as we had seen it then but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair and leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom and when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound and i saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade i merely screamed and ran away idiotically my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughtermadness rides the starwind claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats from nightblack ruins of buried temples of belial now as the baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed webwings circles closer and closer i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable,1
to s lapropos of sleep that sinister adventure of all our nights we may say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of ignorance of the dangerbaudelairemay the merciful gods if indeed there be such guard those hours when no power of the will or drug that the cunning of man devises can keep me from the chasm of sleep death is merciful for there is no return therefrom but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night haggard and knowing peace rests nevermore fool that i was to plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate fool or god thathewasmy only friend who led me and went before me and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be minewe met i recall in a railway station where he was the centre of a crowd of the vulgarly curious he was unconscious having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight blackclad body a strange rigidity i think he was then approaching forty years of age for there were deep lines in the face wan and hollowcheeked but oval and actuallybeautifuland touches of grey in the thick waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus and of a height and breadth almost godlike i said to myself with all the ardour of a sculptor that this man was a fauns statue out of antique hellas dug from a temples ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years and when he opened his immense sunken and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only friendthe only friend of one who had never possessed a friend beforefor i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality realms which i had cherished in fancy but vainly sought so as i drove the crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries and he assented without speaking a word afterward i found that his voice was musicthe music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres we talked often in the night and in the day when i chiselled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalise his different expressionsof our studies it is impossible to speak since they held so slight a connexion with anything of the world as living men conceive it they were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter time and space and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleepthose rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men the cosmos of our waking knowledge born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jesters whim men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly wise men have interpreted dreams and the gods have laughed one man with oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative and men have laughed but even that man with oriental eyes has done no more than suspect i had wished and tried to do more than suspect and my friend had tried and partly succeeded then we both tried together and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manorhouse in hoary kentamong the agonies of these after days is that chief of tormentsinarticulateness what i learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be toldfor want of symbols or suggestions in any language i say this because from first to last our discoveries partook only of the nature ofsensationssensations correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving they were sensations yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and spacethings which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling themplungingsorsoaringsfor in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present rushing arially along shocking unlighted and fearhaunted abysses and occasionallytearingthrough certain wellmarked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous uncouth clouds or vapours in these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together when we were together my friend was always far ahead i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me golden from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty its anomalously youthful cheeks its burning eyes its olympian brow and its shadowing hair and growth of beardof the progress of time we kept no record for time had become to us the merest illusion i know only that there must have been something very singular involved since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old our discourse was unholy and always hideously ambitiousno god or daemon could have aspired to discoveries and conquests like those which we planned in whispers i shiver as i speak of them and dare not be explicit though i will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky i will hintonly hintthat he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command and the destinies of all living things be his i affirmi swearthat i had no share in these extreme aspirations anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be erroneous for i am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable warfare in unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve successthere was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known my friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether and i could see the sinister exultation on his floating luminous too youthful memoryface suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared and in a brief space i found myself projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate it was like the others yet incalculably denser a sticky clammy mass if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a nonmaterial spherei had i felt been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed struggling anew i came to the end of the drugdream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellowdreamer weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed goldgreen light on his marble features then after a short interval the form in the corner stirred and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me i cannot tell you how he shrieked or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright i can only say that i fainted and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his phrensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolationthat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream awed shaken and portentous my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again what he had seen he dared not tell me but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake that he was right i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed after each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking it is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before ones eyes our mode of life was now totally altered heretofore a recluse so far as i knowhis true name and origin never having passed his lipsmy friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude at night he would not be alone nor would the company of a few persons calm him his sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown to us our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which i keenly resented but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein he did not always glance at the same place in the skyit seemed to be a different place at different times on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast in the summer it would be nearly overhead in the autumn it would be in the northwest in winter it would be in the east but mostly if in the small hours of morning midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him only after two years did i connect this fear with anything in particular but then i began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glancea spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealiswe now had a studio in london never separating but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world we were aged and weak from our drugs dissipations and nervous overstrain and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snowwhite our freedom from long sleep was surprising for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace then came one january of fog and rain when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy my statues and ivory heads were all sold and i had no means to purchase new materials or energy to fashion them even had i possessed them we suffered terribly and on a certain night my friend sank into a deepbreathing sleep from which i could not awaken him i can recall the scene nowthe desolate pitchblack garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down the ticking of the lone clock the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressingtable the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space and worst of all the deep steady sinister breathing of my friend on the coucha rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden unimagined and hideously remotethe tension of my vigil became oppressive and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind i heard a clock strike somewherenot ours for that was not a striking clockand my morbid fancy found in this a new startingpoint for idle wanderings clockstimespaceinfinityand then my fancy reverted to the local as i reflected that even now beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere corona borealis was rising in the northeast corona borealis which my friend had appeared to dread and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether all at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drugmagnified soundsa low and damnably insistent whine from very far away droning clamouring mocking callingfrom the northeastbut it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door it was not what iheardbut what isawfor in that dark locked shuttered and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible redgold lighta shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memoryface as i had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmareand as i looked i beheld the head rise the black liquid and deepsunken eyes open in terror and the thin shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered there dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face as it shone bodiless luminous and rejuvenated in the blackness more of stark teeming brainshattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me no word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer but as i followed the memoryfaces mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source the source whence also the whining came i too saw for an instant what it saw and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking and epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police never could i tell try as i might what it actually was that i saw nor could the still face tell for although it must have seen more than i did it will never speak again but always i shall guard against the mocking and insatiate hypnos lord of sleep against the night sky and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophyjust what happened is unknown for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness they have said i know not for what reason that i never had a friend but that art philosophy and insanity had filled all my tragic life the lodgers and police on that night soothed me and the doctor administered something to quiet me nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place my stricken friend moved them to no pity but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours bald greybearded shrivelled palsied drugcrazed and broken adoring and praying to the object they foundfor they deny that i sold the last of my statuary and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold petrified and unvocal it is all that remains of my friend the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage a godlike head of such marble as only old hellas could yield young with the youth that is outside time and with beauteous bearded face curved smiling lips olympian brow and dense locks waving and poppycrowned they say that that haunting memoryface is modelled from my own as it was at twentyfive but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of attica,1
as ibid says in his famouslives of the poetsfrom a student themethe erroneous idea that ibid is the author of thelivesis so frequently met with even among those pretending to a degree of culture that it is worth correcting it should be a matter of general knowledge that cf is responsible for this work ibids masterpiece on the other hand was the famousop citwherein all the significant undercurrents of graecoroman expression were crystallised once for alland with admirable acuteness notwithstanding the surprisingly late date at which ibid wrote there is a false reportvery commonly reproduced in modern books prior to von schweinkopfs monumentalgeschichte der ostrogothen in italienthat ibid was a romanised visigoth of ataulfs horde who settled in placentia about 410 ad the contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised for von schweinkopf and since his time littlewit1and btenoir2have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine romanor at least as genuine a roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produceof whom one might well say what gibbon said of boethius that he was the last whom cato or tully could have acknowledged for their countryman he was like boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age of the great anician family and traced his genealogy with much exactitude and selfsatisfaction to all the heroes of the republic his full namelong and pompous according to the custom of an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic roman nomenclatureis stated by von schweinkopf3to have been caius anicius magnus furius camillus milianus cornelius valerius pompeius julius ibidus though littlewit4rejectsmilianusand addsclaudius decius junianuswhilst btenoir5differs radically giving the full name as magnus furius camillus aurelius antoninus flavius anicius petronius valentinianus aegidus ibidusthe eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486 shortly after the extinction of the roman rule in gaul by clovis rome and ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of athensthe extent of whose suppression by theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial in 512 under the benign rule of the ostrogoth theodoric we behold him as a teacher of rhetoric at rome and in 516 he held the consulship together with pompilius numantius bombastes marcellinus deodamnatus upon the death of theodoric in 526 ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work whose pure ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of claudius claudianus who flourished a century before ibidus but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court rhetorician for theodatus nephew of theodoricupon the usurpation of vitiges ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time imprisoned but the coming of the byzantineroman army under belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours throughout the siege of rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders and afterward followed the eagles of belisarius to alba porto and centumcellae after the frankish siege of milan ibidus was chosen to accompany the learned bishop datius to greece and resided with him at corinth in the year 539 about 541 he removed to constantinopolis where he received every mark of imperial favour both from justinianus and justinus the second the emperors tiberius and maurice did kindly honour to his old age and contributed much to his immortalityespecially maurice whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old rome notwithstanding his birth at arabiscus in cappadocia it was maurice who in the poets 101st year secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the schools of the empire an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged rhetoricians emotions since he passed away peacefully at his home near the church of st sophia on the sixth day before the kalends of september ad 587 in the 102nd year of his agehis remains notwithstanding the troubled state of italy were taken to ravenna for interment but being interred in the suburb of classe were exhumed and ridiculed by the lombard duke of spoleto who took his skull to king autharis for use as a wassailbowl ibids skull was proudly handed down from king to king of the lombard line upon the capture of pavia by charlemagne in 774 the skull was seized from the tottering desiderius and carried in the train of the frankish conqueror it was from this vessel indeed that pope leo administered the royal unction which made of the heronomad a holy roman emperor charlemagne took ibids skull to his capital at aix soon afterward presenting it to his saxon teacher alcuin upon whose death in 804 it was sent to alcuins kinsfolk in englandwilliam the conqueror finding it in an abbey niche where the pious family of alcuin had placed it believing it to be the skull of a saint6who had miraculously annihilated the lombards by his prayers did reverence to its osseous antiquity and even the rough soldiers of cromwell upon destroying ballylough abbey in ireland in 1650 it having been secretly transported thither by a devout papist in 1539 upon henry viiis dissolution of the english monasteries declined to offer violence to a relic so venerableit was captured by the private soldier reademandweep hopkins who not long after traded it to restinjehovah stubbs for a quid of new virginia weed stubbs upon sending forth his son zerubbabel to seek his fortune in new england in 1661 for he thought ill of the restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman gave him st ibidsor rather brother ibids for he abhorred all that was popishskull as a talisman upon landing in salem zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney he having built a modest house near the town pump however he had not been wholly unaffected by the restoration influence and having become addicted to gaming lost the skull to one epenetus dexter a visiting freeman of providenceit was in the house of dexter in the northern part of the town near the present intersection of north main and olney streets on the occasion of canonchets raid of march 30 1676 during king philips war and the astute sachem recognising it at once as a thing of singular venerableness and dignity sent it as a symbol of alliance to a faction of the pequots in connecticut with whom he was negotiating on april 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed but the austere head of ibid continued on its wanderingsthe pequots enfeebled by a previous war could give the now stricken narragansetts no assistance and in 1680 a dutch furtrader of albany petrus van schaack secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders he having recognised its value from the halfeffaced inscription carved in lombardic minuscules palaeography it might be explained was one of the leading accomplishments of newnetherland furtraders of the seventeenth centuryfrom van schaack sad to say the relic was stolen in 1683 by a french trader jean grenier whose popish zeal recognised the features of one whom he had been taught at his mothers knee to revere as st ibide grenier fired with virtuous rage at the possession of this holy symbol by a protestant crushed van schaacks head one night with an axe and escaped to the north with his booty soon however being robbed and slain by the halfbreed voyageur michel savard who took the skulldespite the illiteracy which prevented his recognising itto add to a collection of similar but more recent materialupon his death in 1701 his halfbreed son pierre traded it among other things to some emissaries of the sacs and foxes and it was found outside the chiefs tepee a generation later by charles de langlade founder of the trading post at green bay wisconsin de langlade regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at the expense of many glass beads yet after his time it found itself in many other hands being traded to settlements at the head of lake winnebago to tribes around lake mendota and finally early in the nineteenth century to one solomon juneau a frenchman at the new trading post of milwaukee on the menominee river and the shore of lake michiganlater traded to jacques caboche another settler it was in 1850 lost in a game of chess or poker to a newcomer named hans zimmerman being used by him as a beerstein until one day under the spell of its contents he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie path before

dedicated to c w smithfrom whose suggestion the central situation is takenthere is nothing more absurd as i view it than that conventional association of the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the psychology of the multitude mention a bucolic yankee setting a bungling and thickfibred village undertaker and a careless mishap in a tomb and no average reader can be brought to expect more than a hearty albeit grotesque phase of comedy god knows though that the prosy tale which george birchs death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are lightbirch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881 yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it neither did his old physician dr davis who died years ago it was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of peck valley cemetery escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means but while this much was undoubtedly true there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last he confided in me because i was his doctor and because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after davis died he was a bachelor wholly without relativesbirch before 1881 had been the village undertaker of peck valley and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go the practices i heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today at least in a city and even peck valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly layingout apparel invisible beneath the caskets lid and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy most distinctly birch was lax insensitive and professionally undesirable yet i still think he was not an evil man he was merely crass of fibre and functionthoughtless careless and liquorish as his easily avoidable accident proves and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by tastejust where to begin birchs story i can hardly decide since i am no practiced teller of tales i suppose one should start in the cold december of 1880 when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring fortunately the village was small and the death rate low so that it was possible to give all of birchs inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated receiving tomb the undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter weather and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness never did he knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets or disregard more flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandonat last the spring thaw came and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb birch though dreading the bother of removal and interment began his task of transference one disagreeable april morning but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse after having laid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest that was darius peck the nonagenarian whose grave was not far from the tomb birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old matthew fenner whose grave was also near by but actually postponed the matter for three days not getting to work till good friday the 15th being without superstition he did not heed the day at all though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week certainly the events of that evening greatly changed george birchon the afternoon of friday april 15th then birch set out for the tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of matthew fenner that he was not perfectly sober he subsequently admitted though he had not then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget certain things he was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head much as on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it the day was clear but a high wind had sprung up and birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and entered the sidehill vault another might not have relished the damp odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins but birch in those days was insensitive and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right grave he had not forgotten the criticism aroused when hannah bixbys relatives wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they had moved found the casket of judge capwell beneath her headstonethe light was dim but birchs sight was good and he did not get asaph sawyers coffin by mistake although it was very similar he had indeed made that coffin for matthew fenner but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and flimsy in a fit of curious sentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had been to him during his bankruptcy five years before he gave old matt the very best his skill could produce but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen and to use it when asaph sawyer died of a malignant fever sawyer was not a lovable man and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied to him birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the fenner casketit was just as he had recognised old matts coffin that the door slammed to in the wind leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before the narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch in this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles pushed at the iron panels and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant in this twilight too he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply for the longneglected latch was obviously broken leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault a victim of his own oversightthe thing must have happened at about threethirty in the afternoon birch being by temperament phlegmatic and practical did not shout long but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb it is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly his days work was sadly interrupted and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither he might have to remain all night or longer the pile of tools soon reached and a hammer and chisel selected birch returned over the coffins to the door the air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled half by feeling at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch he would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle but lacking these bungled semisightlessly as best he mightwhen he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these birch glanced about for other possible points of escape the vault had been dug from a hillside so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth making this direction utterly useless to consider over the door however the high slitlike transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb and the coffin niches on the sides and rearwhich birch seldom took the trouble to useafforded no ascent to the space above the door only the coffins themselves remained as potential steppingstones and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of arranging them three coffinheights he reckoned would permit him to reach the transom but he could do better with four the boxes were fairly even and could be piled up like blocks so he began to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep as he planned he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty is strongly to be doubtedfinally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall to place upon this two layers of two each and upon these a single box to serve as the platform this arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness and would furnish the desired height better still though he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course several of the coffins began to split under the stress of handling and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of little matthew fenner for the top in order that his feet might have as certain a surface as possible in the semigloom he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one and indeed came upon it almost by accident since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layerthe tower at length finished and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom the borders of the space were entirely of brick and there seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body to pass as his hammer blows began to fall the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and may have been mocking in either case it would have been appropriate for the unexpected tenacity of the easylooking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulusdusk fell and found birch still toiling he worked largely by feeling now since newly gathered clouds hid the moon and though progress was still slow he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture he could he was sure get out by midnightthough it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time the place and the company beneath his feet he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork cursing when a fragment hit him in the face and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree in time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked he would not he found have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permitit must have been midnight at least when birch decided he could get through the transom tired and perspiring despite many rests he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside the hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily and he vaguely wished it would stop he was curiously unelated over his impending escape and almost dreaded the exertion for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age as he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly especially when upon reaching the topmost one he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood he had it seems planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine maddened by the sound or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh and plunged madly off through the night the wagon rattling crazily behind itbirch in his ghastly situation was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom but gathered his energies for a determined try clutching the edges of the aperture he sought to pull himself up when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles in another moment he knew fear for the first time that night for struggle as he would he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity horrible pains as of savage wounds shot through his calves and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters loose nails or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box perhaps he screamed at any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a halfswooninstinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground he could not walk it appeared and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare there was evidently however no pursuer for he was alone and alive when armington the lodgekeeper answered his feeble clawing at the doorarmington helped birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son edwin for dr davis the afflicted man was fully conscious but would say nothing of any consequence merely muttering such things as oh my ankles let go or shut in the tomb then the doctor came with his medicinecase and asked crisp questions and removed the patients outer clothing shoes and socks the woundsfor both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the achilles tendonsseemed to puzzle the old physician greatly and finally almost to frighten him his questioning grew more than medically tense and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possiblefor an impersonal doctor davis ominous and awestruck crossexamination became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience he was oddly anxious to know if birch were sureabsolutely sureof the identity of that top coffin of the pile how he had chosen it how he had been certain of it as the fenner coffin in the dusk and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious asaph sawyer would the firm fenner casket have caved in so readily davis an oldtime village practitioner had of course seen both at the respective funerals as indeed he had attended both fenner and sawyer in their last illnesses he had even wondered at sawyers funeral how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive fennerafter a full two hours dr davis left urging birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood what else he added could ever in any case be proved or believed but it would be well to say as little as could be said and to let no other doctor treat the wounds birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story and when i saw the scarsancient and whitened as they then werei agreed that he was wise in so doing he always remained lame for the great tendons had been severed but i think the greatest lameness was in his soul his thinking processes once so phlegmatic and logical had become ineffaceably scarred and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as friday tomb coffin and words of less obvious concatenation his frightened horse had gone home but his frightened wits never quite did that he changed his business but something always preyed upon him it may have been just fear and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities his drinking of course only aggravated what it was meant to alleviatewhen dr davis left birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb the moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms the doctor entered and looked about stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced he cried aloud once and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriolit was asaphs coffin birch just as i thought i knew his teeth with the front ones missing on the upper jawnever for gods sake shew those wounds the body was pretty badly gone but if ever i saw vindictiveness on any faceor former face you know what a fiend he was for revengehow he ruined old raymond thirty years after their boundary suit and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last august he was the devil incarnate birch and i believe his eyeforaneye fury could beat old father death himself god what a rage id hate to have it aimed at mewhy did you do it birch he was a scoundrel and i dont blame you for giving him a castaside coffin but you always did go too damned far well enough to skimp on the thing some way but you knew what a little man old fenner wasill never get the picture out of my head as long as i live you kicked hard for asaphs coffin was on the floor his head was broken in and everything was tumbled about ive seen sights before but there was one thing too much here an eye for an eye great heavens birch but you got what you deserved the skull turned my stomach but the other was worsethose ankles cut neatly off to fit matt fenners castaside

before i try to rest i will set down these notes in preparation for the report i must make what i have found is so singular and so contrary to all past experience and expectations that it deserves a very careful descriptioni reached the main landing on venus march 18 terrestrial time vi 9 of the planets calendar being put in the main group under miller i received my equipmentwatch tuned to venuss slightly quicker rotationand went through the usual mask drill after two days i was pronounced fit for dutyleaving the crystal companys post at terra nova around dawn vi 12 i followed the southerly route which anderson had mapped out from the air the going was bad for these jungles are always half impassable after a rain it must be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and creepers that leathery toughness a toughness so great that a knife has to work ten minutes on some of them by noon it was dryerthe vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that the knife went through it easilybut even then i could not make much speed these carter oxygen masks are too heavyjust carrying one half wears an ordinary man out a dubois mask with spongereservoir instead of tubes would give just as good air at half the weightthe crystaldetector seemed to function well pointing steadily in a direction verifying andersons report it is curious how that principle of affinity workswithout any of the fakery of the old divining rods back home there must be a great deposit of crystals within a thousand miles though i suppose those damnable manlizards always watch and guard it possibly they think we are just as foolish for coming to venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for grovelling in the mud whenever they see a piece of it or for keeping that great mass on a pedestal in their temple i wish theyd get a new religion for they have no use for the crystals except to pray to barring theology they would let us take all we wantand even if they learned to tap them for power thered be more than enough for their planet and the earth besides i for one am tired of passing up the main deposits and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle riverbeds sometime ill urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff army from home about twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn the trick one cant call the damned things men for all their cities and towers they havent any skill except buildingand using swords and poison dartsand i dont believe their socalled cities mean much more than anthills or beaverdams i doubt if they even have a real languageall the talk about psychological communication through those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk what misleads people is their upright posture just an accidental physical resemblance to terrestrial manid like to go through a venus jungle for once without having to watch out for skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts they may have been all right before we began to take the crystals but theyre certainly a bad enough nuisance nowwith their dartshooting and their cutting of our water pipes more and more i come to believe that they have a special sense like our crystaldetectors no one ever knew them to bother a manapart from longdistance snipingwho didnt have crystals on himaround 1 pm a dart nearly took my helmet off and i thought for a second one of my oxygen tubes was punctured the sly devils hadnt made a sound but three of them were closing in on me i got them all by sweeping in a circle with my flame pistol for even though their colour blended with the jungle i could spot the moving creepers one of them was fully eight feet tall with a snout like a tapirs the other two were average sevenfooters all that makes them hold their own is sheer numberseven a single regiment of flame throwers could raise hell with them it is curious though how theyve come to be dominant on the planet not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans and skorahs or the flying tukahs of the other continentunless of course those holes in the dionaean plateau hide somethingabout two oclock my detector veered westward indicating isolated crystals ahead on the right this checked up with anderson and i turned my course accordingly it was harder goingnot only because the ground was rising but because the animal life and carnivorous plants were thicker i was always slashing ugrats and stepping on skorahs and my leather suit was all speckled from the bursting darohs which struck it from all sides the sunlight was all the worse because of the mist and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least every time i stepped my feet sank down five or six inches and there was a sucking sort ofblupevery time i pulled them out i wish somebody would invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this climate cloth of course would rot but some thin metallic tissue that couldnt tearlike the surface of this revolving decayproof record scrollought to be feasible some timei ate about 330if slipping these wretched food tablets through my mask can be called eating soon after that i noticed a decided change in the landscapethe bright poisonouslooking flowers shifting in colour and getting wraithlike the outlines of everything shimmered rhythmically and bright points of light appeared and danced in the same slow steady tempo after that the temperature seemed to fluctuate in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drummingthe whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep regular pulsations that filled every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind alike i lost all sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily nor did it change things in the least when i shut my eyes and covered my ears with my hands however my mind was still clear and in a very few minutes i realised what had happenedi had encountered at last one of those curious mirageplants about which so many of our men told stories anderson had warned me of them and described their appearance very closelythe shaggy stalk the spiky leaves and the mottled blossoms whose gaseous dreambreeding exhalations penetrate every existing make of maskrecalling what happened to bailey three years ago i fell into a momentary panic and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy chaotic world which the plants exhalations had woven around me then good sense came back and i realised all i need do was retreat from the dangerous blossoms heading away from the source of the pulsations and cutting a path blindlyregardless of what might seem to swirl around meuntil safely out of the plants effective radiusalthough everything was spinning perilously i tried to start in the right direction and hack my way ahead my route must have been far from straight for it seemed hours before i was free of the mirageplants pervasive influence gradually the dancing lights began to disappear and the shimmering spectral scenery began to assume the aspect of solidity when i did get wholly clear i looked at my watch and was astonished to find that the time was only 420 though eternities had seemed to pass the whole experience could have consumed little more than a halfhourevery delay however was irksome and i had lost ground in my retreat from the plant i now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by the crystaldetector bending every energy toward making better time the jungle was still thick though there was less animal life once a carnivorous blossom engulfed my right foot and held it so tightly that i had to hack it free with my knife reducing the flower to strips before it let goin less than an hour i saw that the jungle growths were thinning out and by five oclockafter passing through a belt of treeferns with very little underbrushi emerged on a broad mossy plateau my progress now became rapid and i saw by the wavering of my detectorneedle that i was getting relatively close to the crystal i sought this was odd for most of the scattered egglike spheroids occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this treeless uplandthe terrain sloped upward ending in a definite crest i reached the top about 530 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests in the distance this without question was the plateau mapped by matsugawa from the air fifty years ago and called on our maps eryx or the erycinian highland but what made my heart leap was a smaller detail whose position could not have been far from the plains exact centre it was a single point of light blazing through the mist and seeming to draw a piercing concentrated luminescence from the yellowish vapourdulled sunbeams this without doubt was the crystal i soughta thing possibly no larger than a hens egg yet containing enough power to keep a city warm for a year i could hardly wonder as i glimpsed the distant glow that those miserable manlizards worship such crystals and yet they have not the least notion of the powers they containbreaking into a rapid run i tried to reach the unexpected prize as soon as possible and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a thin singularly detestable mud studded with occasional patches of weeds and creepers but i splashed on heedlesslyscarcely thinking to look around for any of the skulking manlizards in this open space i was not very likely to be waylaid as i advanced the light ahead seemed to grow in size and brilliancy and i began to notice some peculiarity in its situation clearly this was a crystal of the very finest quality and my elation grew with every spattering stepit is now that i must begin to be careful in making my report since what i shall henceforward have to say involves unprecedentedthough fortunately verifiablematters i was racing ahead with mounting eagerness and had come within an hundred yards or so of the crystalwhose position on a sort of raised place in the omnipresent slime seemed very oddwhen a sudden overpowering force struck my chest and the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward into the mud the splash of my fall was terrific nor did the softness of the ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head from a bewildering jarring for a moment i lay supine too utterly startled to think then i halfmechanically stumbled to my feet and began to scrape the worst of the mud and scum from my leather suitof what i had encountered i could not form the faintest idea i had seen nothing which could have caused the shock and i saw nothing now had i after all merely slipped in the mud my sore knuckles and aching chest forbade me to think so or was this whole incident an illusion brought on by some hidden mirageplant it hardly seemed probable since i had none of the usual symptoms and since there was no place near by where so vivid and typical a growth could lurk unseen had i been on the earth i would have suspected a barrier of nforce laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone but in this humanless region such a notion would have been absurdfinally pulling myself together i decided to investigate in a cautious way holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me so that it might be first to feel the strange force i started once more for the shining crystalpreparing to advance step by step with the greatest deliberation at the third step i was brought up short by the impact of the knifepoint on an apparently solid surfacea solid surface where my eyes saw nothingafter a moments recoil i gained boldness extending my gloved left hand i verified the presence of invisible solid matteror a tactile illusion of solid matterahead of me upon moving my hand i found that the barrier was of substantial extent and of an almost glassy smoothness with no evidence of the joining of separate blocks nerving myself for further experiments i removed a glove and tested the thing with my bare hand it was indeed hard and glassy and of a curious coldness as contrasted with the air around i strained my eyesight to the utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing substance but could discern nothing whatsoever there was not even any evidence of refractive power as judged by the aspect of the landscape ahead absence of reflective power was proved by the lack of a glowing image of the sun at any pointburning curiosity began to displace all other feelings and i enlarged my investigations as best i could exploring with my hands i found that the barrier extended from the ground to some level higher than i could reach and that it stretched off indefinitely on both sides it was then a wall of some kindthough all guesses as to its materials and its purpose were beyond me again i thought of the mirageplant and the dreams it induced but a moments reasoning put this out of my headknocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife and kicking at it with my heavy boots i tried to interpret the sounds thus made there was something suggestive of cement or concrete in these reverberations though my hands had found the surface more glassy or metallic in feel certainly i was confronting something strange beyond all previous experiencethe next logical move was to get some idea of the walls dimensions the height problem would be hard if not insoluble but the length and shape problem could perhaps be sooner dealt with stretching out my arms and pressing close to the barrier i began to edge gradually to the leftkeeping very careful track of the way i faced after several steps i concluded that the wall was not straight but that i was following part of some vast circle or ellipse and then my attention was distracted by something wholly differentsomething connected with the stilldistant crystal which had formed the object of my questi have said that even from a greater distance the shining objects position seemed indefinably queeron a slight mound rising from the slime nowat about an hundred yardsi could see plainly despite the engulfing mist just what that mound was it was the body of a man in one of the crystal companys leather suits lying on his back and with his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few inches away in his right hand crushed convulsively against his chest was the crystal which had led me herea spheroid of incredible size so large that the dead fingers could scarcely close over it even at the given distance i could see that the body was a recent one there was little visible decay and i reflected that in this climate such a thing meant death not more than a day before soon the hateful farnothflies would begin to cluster about the corpse i wondered who the man was surely no one i had seen on this trip it must have been one of the oldtimers absent on a long roving commission who had come to this especial region independently of andersons survey there he lay past all trouble and with the rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his stiffened fingersfor fully five minutes i stood there staring in bewilderment and apprehension a curious dread assailed me and i had an unreasonable impulse to run away it could not have been done by those slinking manlizards for he still held the crystal he had found was there any connexion with the invisible wall where had he found the crystal andersons instrument had indicated one in this quarter well before this man could have perished i now began to regard the unseen barrier as something sinister and recoiled from it with a shudder yet i knew i must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of this recent tragedysuddenlywrenching my mind back to the problem i facedi thought of a possible means of testing the walls height or at least of finding whether or not it extended indefinitely upward seizing a handful of mud i let it drain until it gained some coherence and then flung it high in the air toward the utterly transparent barrier at a height of perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible surface with a resounding splash disintegrating at once and oozing downward in disappearing streams with surprising rapidity plainly the wall was a lofty one a second handful hurled at an even sharper angle hit the surface about eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the firsti now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful as high as i possibly could letting the mud drain and squeezing it to maximum dryness i flung it up so steeply that i feared it might not reach the obstructing surface at all it did however and this time it crossed the barrier and fell in the mud beyond with a violent spattering at last i had a rough idea of the height of the wall for the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or 21 feet aloftwith a nineteen or twentyfoot vertical wall of glassy flatness ascent was clearly impossible i must then continue to circle the barrier in the hope of finding a gate an ending or some sort of interruption did the obstacle form a complete round or other closed figure or was it merely an arc or semicircle acting on my decision i resumed my slow leftward circling moving my hands up and down over the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or other small aperture before starting i tried to mark my position by kicking a hole in the mud but found the slime too thin to hold any impression i did though gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in the distant forest which seemed just on a line with the gleaming crystal an hundred yards away if no gate or break existed i could now tell when i had completely circumnavigated the walli had not progressed far before i decided that the curvature indicated a circular enclosure of about an hundred yards diameterprovided the outline was regular this would mean that the dead man lay near the wall at a point almost opposite the region where i had started was he just inside or just outside the enclosure this i would soon ascertainas i slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate window or other break i decided that the body was lying within on closer view the features of the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing i found something alarming in his expression and in the way the glassy eyes stared by the time i was very near i believed i recognised him as dwight a veteran whom i had never known but who was pointed out to me at the post last year the crystal he clutched was certainly a prizethe largest single specimen i had ever seeni was so near the body that i couldbut for the barrierhave touched it when my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the unseen surface in a second i had learned that there was an opening about three feet wide extending from the ground to a height greater than i could reach there was no door nor any evidence of hingemarks bespeaking a former door without a moments hesitation i stepped through and advanced two paces to the prostrate bodywhich lay at right angles to the hallway i had entered in what seemed to be an intersecting doorless corridor it gave me a fresh curiosity to find that the interior of this vast enclosure was divided by partitionsbending to examine the corpse i discovered that it bore no wounds this scarcely surprised me since the continued presence of the crystal argued against the pseudoreptilian natives looking about for some possible cause of death my eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close to the bodys feet here indeed was something significant without this device no human being could breathe the air of venus for more than thirty seconds and dwightif it were hehad obviously lost his probably it had been carelessly buckled so that the weight of the tubes worked the straps loosea thing which could not happen with a dubois spongereservoir mask the halfminute of grace had been too short to allow the man to stoop and recover his protectionor else the cyanogen content of the atmosphere was abnormally high at the time probably he had been busy admiring the crystalwherever he may have found it he had apparently just taken it from the pouch in his suit for the flap was unbuttonedi now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead prospectors fingersa task which the bodys stiffness made very difficult the spheroid was larger than a mans fist and glowed as if alive in the reddish rays of the westering sun as i touched the gleaming surface i shuddered involuntarilyas if by taking this precious object i had transferred to myself the doom which had overtaken its earlier bearer however my qualms soon passed and i carefully buttoned the crystal into the pouch of my leather suit superstition has never been one of my failingsplacing the mans helmet over his dead staring face i straightened up and stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the great enclosure all my curiosity about the strange edifice now returned and i racked my brain with speculations regarding its material origin and purpose that the hands of men had reared it i could not for a moment believe our ships first reached venus only 72 years ago and the only human beings on the planet have been those at terra nova nor does human knowledge include any perfectly transparent nonrefractive solid such as the substance of this building prehistoric human invasions of venus can be pretty well ruled out so that one must turn to the idea of native construction did a forgotten race of highly evolved beings precede the manlizards as masters of venus despite their elaborately built cities it seemed hard to credit the pseudoreptiles with anything of this kind there must have been another race aeons ago of which this is perhaps the last relique or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by future expeditions thepurposeof such a structure passes all conjecturebut its strange and seemingly nonpractical material suggests a religious userealising my inability to solve these problems i decided that all i could do was to explore the invisible structure itself that various rooms and corridors extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud i felt convinced and i believed that a knowledge of their plan might lead to something significant so feeling my way back through the doorway and edging past the body i began to advance along the corridor toward those interior regions whence the dead man had presumably come later on i would investigate the hallway i had leftgroping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight i moved slowly onward soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward the centre in everdiminishing curves now and then my touch would reveal a doorless intersecting passage and i several times encountered junctions with two three or four diverging avenues in these latter cases i always followed the inmost route which seemed to form a continuation of the one i had been traversing there would be plenty of time to examine the branches after i had reached and returned from the main regions i can scarcely describe the strangeness of the experiencethreading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by forgotten hands on an alien planetat last still stumbling and groping i felt the corridor end in a sizeable open space fumbling about i found i was in a circular chamber about ten feet across and from the position of the dead man against certain distant forest landmarks i judged that this chamber lay at or near the centre of the edifice out of it opened five corridors besides the one through which i had entered but i kept the latter in mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on the horizon as i stood just within the entrancethere was nothing in this room to distinguish itmerely the floor of thin mud which was everywhere present wondering whether this part of the building had any roof i repeated my experiment with an upwardflung handful of mud and found at once that no covering existed if there had ever been one it must have fallen long ago for not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet as i reflected it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently primordial structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry gaps in the walls and other common attributes of dilapidationwhat was it what had it ever been of what was it made why was there no evidence of separate blocks in the glassy bafflingly homogeneous walls why were there no traces of doors either interior or exterior i knew only that i was in a round roofless doorless edifice of some hard smooth perfectly transparent nonrefractive and nonreflective material an hundred yards in diameter with many corridors and with a small circular room at the centre more than this i could never learn from a direct investigationi now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the westa goldenruddy disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the mistclouded trees of the horizon plainly i would have to hurry if i expected to choose a sleepingspot on dry ground before dark i had long before decided to camp for the night on the firm mossy rim of the plateau near the crest whence i had first spied the shining crystal trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the manlizards it has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of two or more so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours but the really small number of night attacks makes the company careless about such things those scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in seeing at night even with curious glowtorcheshaving picked out again the hallway through which i had come i started to return to the structures entrance additional exploration could wait for another day groping a course as best i could through the spiral corridorwith only general sense memory and a vague recognition of some of the illdefined weed patches on the plain as guidesi soon found myself once more in close proximity to the corpse there were now one or two farnothflies swooping over the helmetcovered face and i knew that decay was setting in with a futile instinctive loathing i raised my hand to brush away this vanguard of the scavengerswhen a strange and astonishing thing became manifest an invisible wall checking the sweep of my arm told me thatnotwithstanding my careful retracing of the wayi had not indeed returned to the corridor in which the body lay instead i was in a parallel hallway having no doubt taken some wrong turn or fork among the intricate passages behindhoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead i continued my advance but presently came to a blank wall i would then have to return to the central chamber and steer my course anew exactly where i had made my mistake i could not tell i glanced at the ground to see if by any miracle guiding footprints had remained but at once realised that the thin mud held impressions only for a very few moments there was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre again and once there i carefully reflected on the proper outward course i had kept too far to the right before this time i must take a more leftward fork somewherejust where i could decide as i wentas i groped ahead a second time i felt quite confident of my correctness and diverged to the left at a junction i was sure i remembered the spiralling continued and i was careful not to stray into any intersecting passages soon however i saw to my disgust that i was passing the body at a considerable distance this passage evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it in the hope that another exit might exist in the half of the wall i had not yet explored i pressed forward for several paces but eventually came once more to a solid barrier clearly the plan of the building was even more complicated than i had thoughti now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try some of the lateral corridors extending toward the body if i chose this second alternative i would run the risk of breaking my mental pattern of where i was hence i had better not attempt it unless i could think of some way of leaving a visible trail behind me just how to leave a trail would be quite a problem and i ransacked my mind for a solution there seemed to be nothing about my person which could leave a mark on anything nor any material which i could scatteror minutely subdivide and scattermy pen had no effect on the invisible wall and i could not lay a trail of my precious food tablets even had i been willing to spare the latter there would not have been even nearly enoughbesides which the small pellets would have instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud i searched my pockets for an oldfashioned notebookoften used unofficially on venus despite the quick rottingrate of paper in the planets atmospherewhose pages i could tear up and scatter but could find none it was obviously impossible to tear the tough thin metal of this revolving decayproof record scroll nor did my clothing offer any possibilities in venuss peculiar atmosphere i could not safely spare my stout leather suit and underwear had been eliminated because of the climatei tried to smear mud on the smooth invisible walls after squeezing it as dry as possible but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as did the heighttesting handfuls i had previously thrown finally i drew out my knife and attempted to scratch a line on the glassy phantom surfacesomething i could recognise with my hand even though i would not have the advantage of seeing it from afar it was useless however for the blade made not the slightest impression on the baffling unknown materialfrustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail i again sought the round central chamber through memory it seemed easier to get back to this room than to steer a definite predetermined course away from it and i had little difficulty in finding it anew this time i listed on my record scroll every turn i madedrawing a crude hypothetical diagram of my route and marking all diverging corridors it was of course maddeningly slow work when everything had to be determined by touch and the possibilities of error were infinite but i believed it would pay in the long runthe long twilight of venus was thick when i reached the central room but i still had hopes of gaining the outside before dark comparing my fresh diagram with previous recollections i believed i had located my original mistake so once more set out confidently along the invisible hallways i veered further to the left than during my previous attempts and tried to keep track of my turnings on the record scroll in case i was still mistaken in the gathering dusk i could see the dim line of the corpse now the centre of a loathsome cloud of farnothflies before long no doubt the muddwelling sificlighs would be oozing in from the plain to complete the ghastly work approaching the body with some reluctance i was preparing to step past it when a sudden collision with a wall told me i was again astrayi now realised plainly that i was lost the complications of this building were too much for offhand solution and i would probably have to do some careful checking before i could hope to emerge still i was eager to get to dry ground before total darkness set in hence i returned once more to the centre and began a rather aimless series of trials and errorsmaking notes by the light of my electric lamp when i used this device i noticed with interest that it produced no reflectionnot even the faintest glisteningin the transparent walls around me i was however prepared for this since the sun had at no time formed a gleaming image in the strange materiali was still groping about when the dusk became total a heavy mist obscured most of the stars and planets but the earth was plainly visible as a glowing bluishgreen point in the southeast it was just past opposition and would have been a glorious sight in a telescope i could even make out the moon beside it whenever the vapours momentarily thinned it was now impossible to see the corpsemy only landmarkso i blundered back to the central chamber after a few false turns after all i would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry ground nothing could be done till daylight and i might as well make the best of it here lying down in the mud would not be pleasant but in my leather suit it could be done on former expeditions i had slept under even worse conditions and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer repugnanceso here i am squatting in the slime of the central room and making these notes on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp there is something almost humorous in my strange unprecedented plight lost in a building without doorsa building which i cannot see i shall doubtless get out early in the morning and ought to be back at terra nova with the crystal by late afternoon it certainly is a beautywith surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp i have just had it out examining it despite my fatigue sleep is slow in coming so i find myself writing at great length i must stop now not much danger of being bothered by those cursed natives in this place the thing i like least is the corpsebut fortunately my oxygen mask saves me from the worst effects i am using the chlorate cubes very sparingly will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in more laterlaterafternoon vi 13there has been more trouble than i expected i am still in the building and will have to work quickly and wisely if i expect to rest on dry ground tonight it took me a long time to get to sleep and i did not wake till almost noon today as it was i would have slept longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze the corpse was a rather bad sightwriggling with sificlighs and with a cloud of farnothflies around it something had pushed the helmet away from the face and it was better not to look at it i was doubly glad of my oxygen mask when i thought of the situationat length i shook and brushed myself dry took a couple of food tablets and put a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of the mask i am using these cubes slowly but wish i had a larger supply i felt much better after my sleep and expected to get out of the building very shortlyconsulting the notes and sketches i had jotted down i was impressed by the complexity of the hallways and by the possibility that i had made a fundamental error of the six openings leading out of the central space i had chosen a certain one as that by which i had enteredusing a sightingarrangement as a guide when i stood just within the opening the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in line with a particular lepidodendron in the faroff forest now it occurred to me that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracythe distance of the corpse making its difference of direction in relation to the horizon comparatively slight when viewed from the openings next to that of my first ingress moreover the tree did not differ as distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the horizonputting the matter to a test i found to my chagrin that i could not be sure which of three openings was the right one had i traversed a different set of windings at each attempted exit this time i would be sure it struck me that despite the impossibility of trailblazing there was one marker i could leave though i could not spare my suit i couldbecause of my thick head of hairspare my helmet and this was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud accordingly i removed the roughly hemispherical device and laid it at the entrance of one of the corridorsthe righthand one of the three i must tryi would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct repeating what i seemed to recall as the proper turns and constantly consulting and making notes if i did not get out i would systematically exhaust all possible variations and if these failed i would proceed to cover the avenues extending from the next opening in the same waycontinuing to the third opening if necessary sooner or later i could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit but i must use patience even at worst i could scarcely fail to reach the open plain in time for a dry nights sleepimmediate results were rather discouraging though they helped me eliminate the righthand opening in little more than an hour only a succession of blind alleys each ending at a great distance from the corpse seemed to branch from this hallway and i saw very soon that it had not figured at all in the previous afternoons wanderings as before however i always found it relatively easy to grope back to the central chamberabout 1 pm i shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began to explore the hallways beyond it at first i thought i recognised the turnings but soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of corridors i could not get near the corpse and this time seemed cut off from the central chamber as well even though i thought i had recorded every move i made there seemed to be tricky twists and crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams and i began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement while patience would of course win in the end i saw that my searching would have to be minute tireless and longcontinuedtwo oclock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridorsconstantly feeling my way looking alternately at my helmet and at the corpse and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence i cursed the stupidity and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this tangle of unseen wallsreflecting that if i had let the thing alone and headed back as soon as i had taken the crystal from the body i would even now be safe at terra novasuddenly it occurred to me that i might be able to tunnel under the invisible walls with my knife and thus effect a short cut to the outsideor to some outwardleading corridor i had no means of knowing how deep the buildings foundations were but the omnipresent mud argued the absence of any floor save the earth facing the distant and increasingly horrible corpse i began a course of feverish digging with the broad sharp bladethere was about six inches of semiliquid mud below which the density of the soil increased sharply this lower soil seemed to be of a different coloura greyish clay rather like the formations near venuss north pole as i continued downward close to the unseen barrier i saw that the ground was getting harder and harder watery mud rushed into the excavation as fast as i removed the clay but i reached through it and kept on working if i could bore any kind of a passage beneath the wall the mud would not stop my wriggling outabout three feet down however the hardness of the soil halted my digging seriously its tenacity was beyond anything i had encountered before even on this planet and was linked with an anomalous heaviness my knife had to split and chip the tightly packed clay and the fragments i brought up were like solid stones or bits of metal finally even this splitting and chipping became impossible and i had to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reachthe hourlong attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one for it used up great stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food tablet and to put an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask it has also brought a pause in the days gropings for i am still much too exhausted to walk after cleaning my hands and arms of the worst of the mud i sat down to write these notesleaning against an invisible wall and facing away from the corpsethat body is simply a writhing mass of vermin nowthe odour has begun to draw some of the slimy akmans from the faroff jungle i notice that many of the efjehweeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous feelers toward the thing but i doubt if any are long enough to reach it i wish some really carnivorous organisms like the skorahs would appear for then they might scent me and wriggle a course through the building toward me things like that have an odd sense of direction i could watch them as they came and jot down their approximate route if they failed to form a continuous line even that would be a great help when i met any the pistol would make short work of thembut i can hardly hope for as much as that now that these notes are made i shall rest a while longer and later will do some more groping as soon as i get back to the central chamberwhich ought to be fairly easyi shall try the extreme lefthand opening perhaps i can get outside by dusk after allnightvi 13new trouble my escape will be tremendously difficult for there are elements i had not suspected another night here in the mud and a fight on my hands tomorrow i cut my rest short and was up and groping again by four oclock after about fifteen minutes i reached the central chamber and moved my helmet to mark the last of the three possible doorways starting through this opening i seemed to find the going more familiar but was brought up short in less than five minutes by a sight that jolted me more than i can describeit was a group of four or five of those detestable manlizards emerging from the forest far off across the plain i could not see them distinctly at that distance but thought they paused and turned toward the trees to gesticulate after which they were joined by fully a dozen more the augmented party now began to advance directly toward the invisible building and as they approached i studied them carefully i had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy shadows of the junglethe resemblance to reptiles was perceptible though i knew it was only an apparent one since these beings have no point of contact with terrestrial life when they drew nearer they seemed less truly reptilianonly the flat head and the green slimy froglike skin carrying out the idea they walked erect on their odd thick stumps and their suctiondiscs made curious noises in the mud these were average specimens about seven feet in height and with four long ropy pectoral tentacles the motions of those tentaclesif the theories of fogg ekberg and janat are right which i formerly doubted but am now more ready to believeindicated that the things were in animated conversationi drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight the odds were bad but the weapon gave me a certain advantage if the things knew this building they would come through it after me and in this way would form a key to getting out just as carnivorous skorahs might have done that they would attack me seemed certain for even though they could not see the crystal in my pouch they could divine its presence through that special sense of theirsyet surprisingly enough they did not attack me instead they scattered and formed a vast circle around meat a distance which indicated that they were pressing close to the unseen wall standing there in a ring the beings stared silently and inquisitively at me waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding their heads and gesturing with their upper limbs after a while i saw others issue from the forest and these advanced and joined the curious crowd those near the corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it it was a horrible sight yet the manlizards seemed quite unconcerned now and then one of them would brush away the farnothflies with its limbs or tentacles or crush a wriggling sificligh or akman or an outreaching efjehweed with the suction discs on its stumpsstaring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders and wondering uneasily why they did not attack me at once i lost for the time being the will power and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out instead i leaned limply against the invisible wall of the passage where i stood letting my wonder merge gradually into a chain of the wildest speculations an hundred mysteries which had previously baffled me seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister significance and i trembled with an acute fear unlike anything i had experienced beforei believed i knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly around me i believed too that i had the secret of the transparent structure at last the alluring crystal which i had seized the body of the man who had seized it before meall these things began to acquire a dark and threatening meaningit was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in this roofless unseen tangle of corridors far from it beyond doubt the place was a genuine mazea labyrinth deliberately built by these hellish beings whose craft and mentality i had so badly underestimated might i not have suspected this before knowing of their uncanny architectural skill the purpose was all too plain it was a trapa trap set to catch human beings and with the crystal spheroid as bait these reptilian things in their war on the takers of crystals had turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against usdwightif this rotting corpse were indeed hewas a victim he must have been trapped some time ago and had failed to find his way out lack of water had doubtless maddened him and perhaps he had run out of chlorate cubes as well probably his mask had not slipped accidentally after all suicide was a likelier thing rather than face a lingering death he had solved the issue by removing the mask deliberately and letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once the horrible irony of his fate lay in his positiononly a few feet from the saving exit he had failed to find one minute more of searching and he would have been safeand now i was trapped as he had been trapped and with this circling herd of curious starers to mock at my predicament the thought was maddening and as it sank in i was seized with a sudden flash of panic which set me running aimlessly through the unseen hallways for several moments i was essentially a maniacstumbling tripping bruising myself on the invisible walls and finally collapsing in the mud as a panting lacerated heap of mindless bleeding fleshthe fall sobered me a bit so that when i slowly struggled to my feet i could notice things and exercise my reason the circling watchers were swaying their tentacles in an odd irregular way suggestive of sly alien laughter and i shook my fist savagely at them as i rose my gesture seemed to increase their hideous mirtha few of them clumsily imitating it with their greenish upper limbs shamed into sense i tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situationafter all i was not as badly off as dwight had been unlike him i knew what the situation wasand forewarned is forearmed i had proof that the exit was attainable in the end and would not repeat his tragic act of impatient despair the bodyor skeleton as it would soon bewas constantly before me as a guide to the soughtfor aperture and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if i worked long and intelligently enoughi had however the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian devils now that i realised the nature of the trapwhose invisible material argued a science and technology beyond anything on earthi could no longer discount the mentality and resources of my enemies even with my flame pistol i would have a bad time getting awaythough boldness and quickness would doubtless see me through in the long runbut first i must reach the exteriorunless i could lure or provoke some of the creatures to advance toward me as i prepared my pistol for action and counted over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to me to try the effect of its blasts on the invisible walls had i overlooked a feasible means of escape there was no clue to the chemical composition of the transparent barrier and conceivably it might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese choosing a section facing the corpse i carefully discharged the pistol at close range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed nothing was changed i had seen the flame spread when it struck the surface and now i realised that my hope had been vain only a long tedious search for the exit would ever bring me to the outsideso swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the electrolyser of my mask i recommenced the long quest retracing my steps to the central chamber and starting out anew i constantly consulted my notes and sketches and made fresh onestaking one false turn after another but staggering on in desperation till the afternoon light grew very dim as i persisted in my quest i looked from time to time at the silent circle of mocking starers and noticed a gradual replacement in their ranks every now and then a few would return to the forest while others would arrive to take their places the more i thought of their tactics the less i liked them for they gave me a hint of the creatures possible motives at any time these devils could have advanced and fought me but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles to escape i could not but infer that they enjoyed the spectacleand this made me shrink with double force from the prospect of falling into their handswith the dark i ceased my searching and sat down in the mud to rest now i am writing in the light of my lamp and will soon try to get some sleep i hope tomorrow will see me out for my canteen is low and lacol tablets are a poor substitute for water i would hardly dare to try the moisture in this slime for none of the water in the mudregions is potable except when distilled that is why we run such long pipe lines to the yellow clay regionsor depend on rainwater when those devils find and cut our pipes i have none too many chlorate cubes either and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as i can my tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon and my later panic flight burned up a perilous amount of air tomorrow i will reduce physical exertion to the barest minimum until i meet the reptiles and have to deal with them i must have a good cube supply for the journey back to terra nova my enemies are still on hand i can see a circle of their feeble glowtorches around me there is a horror about those lights which will keep me awakenightvi 14another full day of searching and still no way out i am beginning to be worried about the water problem for my canteen went dry at noon in the afternoon there was a burst of rain and i went back to the central chamber for the helmet which i had left as a markerusing this as a bowl and getting about two cupfuls of water i drank most of it but have put the slight remainder in my canteen lacol tablets make little headway against real thirst and i hope there will be more rain in the night i am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls food tablets are none too plentiful but not dangerously low i shall halve my rations from now on the chlorate cubes are my real worry for even without violent exercise the days endless tramping burned a dangerous number i feel weak from my forced economies in oxygen and from my constantly mounting thirst when i reduce my food i suppose i shall feel still weakerthere is something damnablesomething uncannyabout this labyrinth i could swear that i had eliminated certain turns through charting and yet each new trial belies some assumption i had thought established never before did i realise how lost we are without visual landmarks a blind man might do betterbut for most of us sight is the king of the senses the effect of all these fruitless wanderings is one of profound discouragement i can understand how poor dwight must have felt his corpse is now just a skeleton and the sificlighs and akmans and farnothflies are gone the efjehweeds are nipping the leather clothing to pieces for they were longer and fastergrowing than i had expected and all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand gloatingly around the barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery another day and i shall go mad if i do not drop dead from exhaustionhowever there is nothing to do but persevere dwight would have got out if he had kept on a minute longer it is just possible that somebody from terra nova will come looking for me before long although this is only my third day out my muscles ache horribly and i cant seem to rest at all lying down in this loathsome mud last night despite my terrific fatigue i slept only fitfully and tonight i fear will be no better i live in an endless nightmarepoised between waking and sleeping yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep my hand shakes i can write no more for the time being that circle of feeble glowtorches is hideouslate afternoonvi 15substantial progress looks good very weak and did not sleep much till daylight then i dozed till noon though without being at all rested no rain and thirst leaves me very weak ate an extra food tablet to keep me going but without water it didnt help much i dared to try a little of the slime water just once but it made me violently sick and left me even thirstier than before must save chlorate cubes so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen cant walk much of the time but manage to crawl in the mud about 2 pm i thought i recognised some passages and got substantially nearer to the corpseor skeletonthan i had been since the first days trials i was sidetracked once in a blind alley but recovered the main trail with the aid of my chart and notes the trouble with these jottings is that there are so many of them they must cover three feet of the record scroll and i have to stop for long periods to untangle themmy head is weak from thirst suffocation and exhaustion and i cannot understand all i have set down those damnable green things keep staring and laughing with their tentacles and sometimes they gesticulate in a way that makes me think they share some terrible joke just beyond my perceptionit was three oclock when i really struck my stride there was a doorway which according to my notes i had not traversed before and when i tried it i found i could crawl circuitously toward the weedtwined skeleton the route was a sort of spiral much like that by which i had first reached the central chamber whenever i came to a lateral doorway or junction i would keep to the course which seemed best to repeat that original journey as i circled nearer and nearer to my gruesome landmark the watchers outside intensified their cryptic gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter evidently they saw something grimly amusing in my progressperceiving no doubt how helpless i would be in any encounter with them i was content to leave them to their mirth for although i realised my extreme weakness i counted on the flame pistol and its numerous extra magazines to get me through the vile reptilian phalanxhope now soared high but i did not attempt to rise to my feet better to crawl now and save my strength for the coming encounter with the manlizards my advance was very slow and the danger of straying into some blind alley very great but none the less i seemed to curve steadily toward my osseous goal the prospect gave me new strength and for the nonce i ceased to worry about my pain my thirst and my scant supply of cubes the creatures were now all massing around the entrancegesturing leaping and laughing with their tentacles soon i reflected i would have to face the entire hordeand perhaps such reinforcements as they would receive from the foresti am now only a few yards from the skeleton and am pausing to make this entry before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of entities i feel confident that with my last ounce of strength i can put them to flight despite their numbers for the range of this pistol is tremendous then a camp on the dry moss at the plateaus edge and in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to terra nova i shall be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings again the teeth of that skull gleam and grin horriblytoward nightvi 15horror and despair baffled again after making the previous entry i approached still closer to the skeleton but suddenly encountered an intervening wall i had been deceived once more and was apparently back where i had been three days before on my first futile attempt to leave the labyrinth whether i screamed aloud i do not knowperhaps i was too weak to utter a sound i merely lay dazed in the mud for a long period while the greenish things outside leaped and laughed and gesturedafter a time i became more fully conscious my thirst and weakness and suffocation were fast gaining on me and with my last bit of strength i put a new cube in the electrolyserrecklessly and without regard for the needs of my journey to terra nova the fresh oxygen revived me slightly and enabled me to look about more alertlyit seemed as if i were slightly more distant from poor dwight than i had been at that first disappointment and i dully wondered if i could be in some other corridor a trifle more remote with this faint shadow of hope i laboriously dragged myself forwardbut after a few feet encountered a dead end as i had on the former occasionthis then was the end three days had taken me nowhere and my strength was gone i would soon go mad from thirst and i could no longer count on cubes enough to get me back i feebly wondered why the nightmare things had gathered so thickly around the entrance as they mocked me probably this was part of the mockeryto make me think i was approaching an egress which they knew did not existi shall not last long though i am resolved not to hasten matters as dwight did his grinning skull has just turned toward me shifted by the groping of one of the efjehweeds that are devouring his leather suit the ghoulish stare of those empty eyesockets is worse than the staring of those lizard horrors it lends a hideous meaning to that dead whitetoothed grini shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength i can this recordwhich i hope may reach and warn those who come after mewill soon be done after i stop writing i shall rest a long while then when it is too dark for those frightful creatures to see i shall muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the record scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside i shall take care to send it toward the left where it will not hit the leaping band of mocking beleaguerers perhaps it will be lost forever in the thin mudbut perhaps it will land in some widespread clump of weeds and ultimately reach the hands of menif it does survive to be read i hope it may do more than merely warn men of this trap i hope it may teach our race to let those shining crystals stay where they are they belong to venus alone our planet does not truly need them and i believe we have violated some obscure and mysterious lawsome law buried deep in the arcana of the cosmosin our attempts to take them who can tell what dark potent and widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who guard their treasure so strangely dwight and i have paid as others have paid and will pay but it may be that these scattered deaths are only the prelude of greater horrors to come let us leave to venus that which belongs only to venus i am very near death now and fear i may not be able to throw the scroll when dusk comes if i cannot i suppose the manlizards will seize it for they will probably realise what it is they will not wish anyone to be warned of the labyrinthand they will not know that my message holds a plea in their own behalf as the end approaches i feel more kindly toward the things in the scale of cosmic entity who can say which species stands higher or more nearly approaches a spacewide organic normtheirs or mine i have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my last moments it shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the dying day the leaping horde have noticed it and their gestures have changed in a way i cannot understand i wonder why they keep clustered around the entrance instead of concentrating at a still closer point in the transparent wall i am growing numb and cannot write much more things whirl around me yet i do not lose consciousness can i throw this over the wall that crystal glows so yet the twilight is deepening dark very weak they are still laughing and leaping around the doorway and have started those hellish glowtorches are they going away i dreamed i heard a sound light in the sky report of wesley p miller supt group avenus crystal coterra nova on venusvi 16our operative a49 kenton j stanfield of 5317 marshall street richmond va left terra nova early on vi 12 for a shortterm trip indicated by detector due back 13th or 14th did not appear by evening of 15th so scouting plane fr58 with five men under my command set out at 8 pm to follow route with detector needle shewed no change from earlier readingsfollowed needle to erycinian highland played strong searchlights all the way triplerange flameguns and dradiationcylinders could have dispersed any ordinary hostile force of natives or any dangerous aggregation of carnivorous skorahswhen over the open plain on eryx we saw a group of moving lights which we knew were native glowtorches as we approached they scattered into the forest probably 75 to 100 in all detector indicated crystal on spot where they had been sailing low over this spot our lights picked out objects on the ground skeleton tangled in efjehweeds and complete body ten feet from it brought plane down near bodies and corner of wing crashed on unseen obstructionapproaching bodies on foot we came up short against a smooth invisible barrier which puzzled us enormously feeling along it near the skeleton we struck an opening beyond which was a space with another opening leading to the skeleton the latter though robbed of clothing by weeds had one of the companys numbered metal helmets beside it it was operative b9 frederick n dwight of koenigs division who had been out of terra nova for two months on a long commissionbetween this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another wall but we could easily identify the second man as stanfield he had a record scroll in his left hand and a pen in his right and seemed to have been writing when he died no crystal was visible but the detector indicated a huge specimen near stanfields bodywe had great difficulty in getting at stanfield but finally succeeded the body was still warm and a great crystal lay beside it covered by the shallow mud we at once studied the record scroll in the left hand and prepared to take certain steps based on its data the contents of the scroll forms the long narrative prefixed to this report a narrative whose main descriptions we have verified and which we append as an explanation of what was found the later parts of this account shew mental decay but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst suffocation cardiac strain and psychological depression his mask was in place and freely generating oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supplyour plane being damaged we sent a wireless and called out anderson with repair plane fg7 a crew of wreckers and a set of blasting materials by morning fr58 was fixed and went back under anderson carrying the two bodies and the crystal we shall bury dwight and stanfield in the company graveyard and ship the crystal to chicago on the next earthbound liner later we shall adopt stanfields suggestionthe sound one in the saner earlier part of his reportand bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether with a clear field there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal we can securein the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great care exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords and preparing a complete chart for our archives we were much impressed by the design and shall keep specimens of the substance for chemical analysis all such knowledge will be useful when we take over the various cities of the natives our type c diamond drills were able to bite into the unseen material and wreckers are now planting dynamite preparatory to a thorough blasting nothing will be left when we are done the edifice forms a distinct menace to arial and other possible trafficin considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with the irony of dwights fate but with that of stanfields as well when trying to reach the second body from the skeleton we could find no access on the right but markheim found a doorway from the first inner space some fifteen feet past dwight and four or five past stanfield beyond this was a long hall which we did not explore till later but on the righthand side of that hall was another doorway leading directly to the body stanfield could have reached the outside entrance by walking 22 or 23 feet if he had found the opening which lay directlybehindhiman opening which he overlooked in his exhaustion and despair,1
ifew persons know the inside of the clarendon story or even that there is an inside not reached by the newspapers it was a san francisco sensation in the days before the fire both because of the panic and menace that kept it company and because of its close linkage with the governor of the state governor dalton it will be recalled was clarendons best friend and later married his sister neither dalton nor mrs dalton would ever discuss the painful affair but somehow the facts have leaked out to a limited circle but for that and for the years which have given a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the actors one would still pause before probing into secrets so strictly guarded at the timethe appointment of dr alfred clarendon as medical director of san quentin penitentiary in 189 was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm throughout california san francisco had at last the honour of harbouring one of the greatest biologists and physicians of the period and solid pathological leaders from all over the world might be expected to flock thither to study his methods profit by his advice and researches and learn how to cope with their own local problems california almost over night would become a centre of medical scholarship with earthwide influence and reputationgovernor dalton anxious to spread the news in its fullest significance saw to it that the press carried ample and dignified accounts of his new appointee pictures of dr clarendon and his new home near old goat hill sketches of his career and manifold honours and popular accounts of his salient scientific discoveries were all presented in the principal california dailies till the public soon felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studies of pyemia in india of the pest in china and of every sort of kindred disorder elsewhere would soon enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of revolutionary importancea basic antitoxin combating the whole febrile principle at its very source and ensuring the ultimate conquest and extirpation of fever in all its diverse formsback of the appointment stretched an extended and not wholly unromantic history of early friendship long separation and dramatically renewed acquaintance james dalton and the clarendon family had been friends in new york ten years beforefriends and more than friends since the doctors only sister georgina was the sweetheart of daltons youth while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his protg in the days of school and college the father of alfred and georgina a wall street pirate of the ruthless elder breed had known daltons father well so well indeed that he had finally stripped him of all he possessed in a memorable afternoons fight on the stock exchange dalton senior hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give his one adored child the benefit of his insurance had promptly blown out his brains but james had not sought to retaliate it was as he viewed it all in the game and he wished no harm to the father of the girl he meant to marry and of the budding young scientist whose admirer and protector he had been throughout their years of fellowship and study instead he turned to the law established himself in a small way and in due course of time asked old clarendon for georginas handold clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly vowing that no pauper and upstart lawyer was fit to be his soninlaw and a scene of considerable violence had occurred james telling the wrinkled freebooter at last what he ought to have been told long before had left the house and the city in a high temper and was embarked within a month upon the california life which was to lead him to the governorship through many a fight with ring and politician his farewells to alfred and georgina had been brief and he had never known the aftermath of that scene in the clarendon library only by a day did he miss the news of old clarendons death from apoplexy and by so missing it changed the course of his whole career he had not written georgina in the decade that followed knowing her loyalty to her father and waiting till his own fortune and position might remove all obstacles to the match nor had he sent any word to alfred whose calm indifference in the face of affection and heroworship had always savoured of conscious destiny and the selfsufficiency of genius secure in the ties of a constancy rare even then he had worked and risen with thoughts only of the future still a bachelor and with a perfect intuitive faith that georgina also was waitingin this faith dalton was not deceived wondering perhaps why no message ever came georgina found no romance save in her dreams and expectations and in the course of time became busy with the new responsibilities brought by her brothers rise to greatness alfreds growth had not belied the promise of his youth and the slim boy had darted quietly up the steps of science with a speed and permanence almost dizzying to contemplate lean and ascetic with steelrimmed pincenez and pointed brown beard dr alfred clarendon was an authority at twentyfive and an international figure at thirty careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of genius he depended vastly on the care and management of his sister and was secretly thankful that her memories of james had kept her from other and more tangible alliancesgeorgina conducted the business and household of the great bacteriologist and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of fever she bore patiently with his eccentricities calmed his occasional bursts of fanaticism and healed those breaches with his friends which now and then resulted from his unconcealed scorn of anything less than a singleminded devotion to pure truth and its progress clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary folk for he never tired of depreciating the service of the individual as contrasted with the service of mankind as a whole and in censuring men of learning who mingled domestic life or outside interests with their pursuit of abstract science his enemies called him a bore but his admirers pausing before the white heat of ecstasy into which he would work himself became almost ashamed of ever having any standards or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed knowledgethe doctors travels were extensive and georgina generally accompanied him on the shorter ones three times however he had taken long lone jaunts to strange and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers and halffabulous plagues for he knew that it is out of the unknown lands of cryptic and immemorial asia that most of the earths diseases spring on each of these occasions he had brought back curious mementoes which added to the eccentricity of his home not least among which was the needlessly large staff of thibetan servants picked up somewhere in utsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard but amidst which clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of black fever these men taller than most thibetans and clearly belonging to a stock but little investigated in the outside world were of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder whether the doctor had sought to symbolise in them the anatomical models of his college years their aspect in the loose black silk robes of bonpa priests which he chose to give them was grotesque in the highest degree and there was an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced their air of fantasy and gave georgina a queer awed feeling of having stumbled into the pages ofvathekor thearabian nightsbut queerest of all was the general factotum or clinicman whom clarendon addressed as surama and whom he had brought back with him after a long stay in northern africa during which he had studied certain odd intermittent fevers among the mysterious saharan tuaregs whose descent from the primal race of lost atlantis is an old archaeological rumour surama a man of great intelligence and seemingly inexhaustible erudition was as morbidly lean as the thibetan servants with swarthy parchmentlike skin drawn so tightly over his bald pate and hairless face that every line of the skull stood out in ghastly prominencethis deathshead effect being heightened by lustrelessly burning black eyes set with a depth which left to common visibility only a pair of dark vacant sockets unlike the ideal subordinate he seemed despite his impassive features to spend no effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed instead he carried about an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement accompanied at certain moments by a deep guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle which has just torn to pieces some furry animal and is ambling away toward the sea his race appeared to be caucasian but could not be classified more closely than that some of clarendons friends thought he looked like a highcaste hindoo notwithstanding his accentless speech while many agreed with georginawho disliked himwhen she gave her opinion that a pharaohs mummy if miraculously brought to life would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeletondalton absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from eastern interests through the peculiar selfsufficiency of the old west had not followed the meteoric rise of his former comrade clarendon had actually heard nothing of one so far outside his chosen world of science as the governor being of independent and even of abundant means the clarendons had for many years stuck to their old manhattan mansion in east nineteenth street whose ghosts must have looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of surama and the thibetans then through the doctors wish to transfer his base of medical observation the great change had suddenly come and they had crossed the continent to take up a secluded life in san francisco buying the gloomy old bannister place near goat hill overlooking the bay and establishing their strange household in a rambling frenchroofed relic of midvictorian design and goldrush parvenu display set amidst highwalled grounds in a region still half suburbandr clarendon though better satisfied than in new york still felt cramped for lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological theories unworldly as he was he had never thought of using his reputation as an influence to gain public appointment though more and more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or a charitable institutiona prison almshouse or hospitalwould give him a field of sufficient width to complete his researches and make his discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at largethen he had run into james dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in market street as the governor was swinging out of the royal hotel georgina had been with him and an almost instant recognition had heightened the drama of the reunion mutual ignorance of one anothers progress had bred long explanation and histories and clarendon was pleased to find that he had so important an official for a friend dalton and georgina exchanging many a glance felt more than a trace of their youthful tenderness and a friendship was then and there revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of confidencesjames dalton learned of his old protgs need for political appointment and sought true to his protective role of school and college days to devise some means of giving little alf the needed position and scope he had it is true wide appointive powers but the legislatures constant attacks and encroachments forced him to exercise these with the utmost discretion at length however scarcely three months after the sudden reunion the foremost institutional medical office in the state fell vacant weighing all the elements with care and conscious that his friends achievements and reputation would justify the most substantial rewards the governor felt at last able to act formalities were few and on the eighth of november 189 dr alfred schuyler clarendon became medical director of the california state penitentiary at san quentiniiin scarcely more than a month the hopes of dr clarendons admirers were amply fulfilled sweeping changes in methods brought to the prisons medical routine an efficiency never before dreamed of and though the subordinates were naturally not without jealousy they were obliged to admit the magical results of a really great mans superintendence then came a time where mere appreciation might well have grown to devout thankfulness at a providential conjunction of time place and man for one morning dr jones came to his new chief with a grave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could not but identify as that selfsame black fever whose germ clarendon had found and classifieddr clarendon shewed no surprise but kept on at the writing before himi know he said evenly i came across that case yesterday im glad you recognised it put the man in a separate ward though i dont believe this fever is contagiousdr jones with his own opinion of the maladys contagiousness was glad of this deference to caution and hastened to execute the order upon his return clarendon rose to leave declaring that he would himself take charge of the case alone disappointed in his wish to study the great mans methods and technique the junior physician watched his chief stride away toward the lone ward where he had placed the patient more critical of the new regime than at any time since admiration had displaced his first jealous pangsreaching the ward clarendon entered hastily glancing at the bed and stepping back to see how far dr joness obvious curiosity might have led him then finding the corridor still vacant he shut the door and turned to examine the sufferer the man was a convict of a peculiarly repulsive type and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony his features were frightfully contracted and his knees drawn sharply up in the mute desperation of the stricken clarendon studied him closely raising his tightly shut eyelids took his pulse and temperature and finally dissolving a tablet in water forced the solution between the sufferers lips before long the height of the attack abated as shewn by the relaxing body and returning normality of expression and the patient began to breathe more easily then by a soft rubbing of the ears the doctor caused the man to open his eyes there was life in them for they moved from side to side though they lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the image of the soul clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had brought feeling behind him the power of an allcapable science he had long known of this case and had snatched the victim from death with the work of a moment another hour and this man would have goneyet jones had seen the symptoms for days before discovering them and having discovered them did not know what to domans conquest of disease however cannot be perfect clarendon assuring the dubious trustynurses that the fever was not contagious had had the patient bathed sponged in alcohol and put to bed but was told the next morning that the case was lost the man had died after midnight in the most intense agony and with such cries and distortions of face that the nurses were driven almost to panic the doctor took this news with his usual calm whatever his scientific feelings may have been and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime then with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders he made the usual rounds of the penitentiarytwo days later the prison was hit again three men came down at once this time and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever epidemic was under way clarendon having adhered so firmly to his theory of noncontagiousness suffered a distinct loss of prestige and was handicapped by the refusal of the trustynurses to attend the patients theirs was not the soulfree devotion of those who sacrifice themselves to science and humanity they were convicts serving only because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy and when the price became too great they preferred to resign the privilegesbut the doctor was still master of the situation consulting with the warden and sending urgent messages to his friend the governor he saw to it that special rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to the convicts for the dangerous nursing service and by this method succeeded in getting a very fair quota of volunteers he was steeled for action now and nothing could shake his poise and determination additional cases brought only a curt nod and he seemed a stranger to fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone home of sadness and evil more than forty cases developed within another week and nurses had to be brought from the city clarendon went home very seldom at this stage often sleeping on a cot in the wardens quarters and always giving himself up with typical abandon to the service of medicine and of mankindthen came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse san francisco news will out and the menace of black fever spread over the town like a fog from the bay reporters trained in the doctrine of sensation first used their imagination without restraint and gloried when at last they were able to produce a case in the mexican quarter which a local physicianfonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic welfarepronounced black feverthat was the last straw frantic at the thought of the crawling death so close upon them the people of san francisco went mad en masse and embarked upon that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to hear over busy wires ferries and rowboats excursion steamers and launches railways and cable cars bicycles and carriages movingvans and work carts all were pressed into instant and frenzied service sausalito and tamalpais as lying in the direction of san quentin shared in the flight while housing space in oakland berkeley and alameda rose to fabulous prices tent colonies sprang up and improvised villages lined the crowded southward highways from millbrae to san jose many sought refuge with friends in sacramento while the frightshaken residue forced by various causes to stay behind could do little more than maintain the basic necessities of a nearly dead citybusiness save for quack doctors with sure cures and preventives for use against the fever fell rapidly to the vanishingpoint at first the saloons offered medicated drinks but soon found that the populace preferred to be duped by charlatans of more professional aspect in strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one anothers faces to glimpse possible plague symptoms and shopkeepers began more and more to refuse admission to their clientele each customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace legal and judicial machinery began to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks succumbed one by one to the urge for flight even the doctors deserted in large numbers many of them pleading the need of vacations among the mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the state schools and colleges theatres and cafs restaurants and saloons all gradually closed their doors and in a single week san francisco lay prostrate and inert with only its light power and water service even half normal with newspapers in skeletonic form and with a crippled parody on transportation maintained by the horse and cable carsthis was the lowest ebb it could not last long for courage and observation are not altogether dead in mankind and sooner or later the nonexistence of any widespread black fever epidemic outside san quentin became too obvious a fact to deny notwithstanding several actual cases and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary suburban tent colonies the leaders and editors of the community conferred and took action enlisting in their service the very reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble but now turning their sensation first avidity into more constructive channels editorials and fictitious interviews appeared telling of dr clarendons complete control of the disease and of the absolute impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison walls reiteration and circulation slowly did their work and gradually a slim backward trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous refluent stream one of the first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversy of the approved acrimonious kind attempting to fix blame for the panic wherever the various participants thought it belonged the returning doctors jealously strengthened by their timely vacations began striking at clarendon assuring the public that they as well as he would keep the fever in leash and censuring him for not doing even more to check its spread within san quentinclarendon had they averred permitted far more deaths than were necessary the veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever contagion and if this renowned savant did not do it it was clearly because he chose for scientific reasons to study the final effects of the disease rather than to prescribe properly and save the victims this policy they insinuated might be proper enough among convicted murderers in a penal institution but it would not do in san francisco where life was still a precious and sacred thing thus they went on and the papers were glad to publish all they wrote since the sharpness of the campaign in which dr clarendon would doubtless join would help to obliterate confusion and restore confidence among the peoplebut clarendon did not reply he only smiled while his singular clinicman surama indulged in many a deep testudinous chuckle he was at home more nowadays so that reporters began besieging the gate of the great wall the doctor had built around his house instead of pestering the wardens office at san quentin results though were equally meagre for surama formed an impassable barrier between the doctor and the outer worldeven after the reporters had got into the grounds the newspaper men getting access to the front hall had glimpses of clarendons singular entourage and made the best they could in a writeup of surama and the queer skeletonic thibetans exaggeration of course occurred in every fresh article and the net effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician most persons hate the unusual and hundreds who could have excused heartlessness or incompetence stood ready to condemn the grotesque taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eight blackrobed orientalsearly in january an especially persistent young man from theobserverclimbed the moated eightfoot brick wall in the rear of the clarendon grounds and began a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which trees concealed from the front walk with quick alert brain he took in everythingthe rosearbour the aviaries the animal cages where all sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guineapigs might be seen and heard the stout wooden clinic building with barred windows in the northwest corner of the yardand bent searching glances throughout the thousand square feet of intramural privacy a great article was brewing and he would have escaped unscathed but for the barking of dick georgina clarendons gigantic and beloved st bernard surama instant in his response had the youth by the collar before a protest could be uttered and was presently shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat and dragging him through the trees to the front yard and the gatebreathless explanations and quavering demands to see dr clarendon were useless surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on suddenly a positive fright crept over the dapper scribe and he began to wish desperately that this unearthly creature would speak if only to prove that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this planet he became deathly sick and strove not to glimpse the eyes which he knew must lie at the base of those gaping black sockets soon he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through in another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly and muddily in the ditch which clarendon had had dug around the entire length of the wall fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive gate slam shut and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the forbidding portal then as he turned to go a soft sound grated behind him and through a small wicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of surama and heard the echoes of a deepvoiced bloodfreezing chucklethis young man feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been rougher than he deserved resolved to revenge himself upon the household responsible for his treatment accordingly he prepared a fictitious interview with dr clarendon supposed to be held in the clinic building during which he was careful to describe the agonies of a dozen black fever patients whom his imagination ranged on orderly rows of couches his masterstroke was the picture of one especially pathetic sufferer gasping for water while the doctor held a glass of the sparkling fluid just out of his reach in a scientific attempt to determine the effect of a tantalising emotion on the course of the disease this invention was followed by paragraphs of insinuating comment so outwardly respectful that it bore a double venom dr clarendon was the article ran undoubtedly the greatest and most singleminded scientist in the world but science is no friend to individual welfare and one would not like to have ones gravest ills drawn out and aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on some point of abstract truth life is too short for thataltogether the article was diabolically skilful and succeeded in horrifying nine readers out of ten against dr clarendon and his supposed methods other papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its substance taking the cue it offered and commencing a series of faked interviews which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy in no case however did the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction he had no time to waste on fools and liars and cared little for the esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised when james dalton telegraphed his regrets and offered aid clarendon replied with an almost boorish curtness he did not heed the barking of dogs and could not bother to muzzle them nor would he thank anyone for messing with a matter wholly beneath notice silent and contemptuous he continued his duties with tranquil evennessbut the young reporters spark had done its work san francisco was insane again and this time as much with rage as with fear sober judgment became a lost art and though no second exodus occurred there ensued a reign of vice and recklessness born of desperation and suggesting parallel phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence hatred ran riot against the man who had found the disease and was struggling to restrain it and a lightheaded public forgot his great services to knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment they seemed in their blindness to hate him in person rather than the plague which had come to their breezecleaned and usually healthy citythen the young reporter playing in the neronic fire he had kindled added a crowning personal touch of his own remembering the indignities he had suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinicman he prepared a masterly article on the home and environment of dr clarendon giving especial prominence to surama whose very aspect he declared sufficient to scare the healthiest person into any sort of fever he tried to make the gaunt chuckler appear equally ridiculous and terrible succeeding best perhaps in the latter half of his intention since a tide of horror always welled up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to the creature he collected all the rumours current about the man elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputed scholarship and hinted darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and aeonweighted africa wherein dr clarendon had found himgeorgina who followed the papers closely felt crushed and hurt by these attacks upon her brother but james dalton who called often at the house did his best to comfort her in this he was warm and sincere for he wished not only to console the woman he loved but to utter some measure of the reverence he had always felt for the starwardbound genius who had been his youths closest comrade he told georgina how greatness can never be exempted from the shafts of envy and cited the long sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar heels the attacks he pointed out formed the truest of all proofs of alfreds solid eminencebut they hurt just the same she rejoined and all the more because i know that al really suffers from them no matter how indifferent he tries to bedalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among wellborn personsand it hurts me a thousand times more knowing that it hurts you and alf but never mind georgie well stand together and pull through itthus it came about that georgina came more and more to rely on the strength of the steelfirm squarejawed governor who had been her youthful swain and more and more to confide in him the things she feared the press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all there were aspects of the household which she did not like surama cruel in equal measure to man and beast filled her with the most unnamable repulsion and she could not but feel that he meant some vague indefinable harm to alfred she did not like the thibetans either and thought it very peculiar that surama was able to talk with them alfred would not tell her who or what surama was but had once explained rather haltingly that he was a much older man than would be commonly thought credible and that he had mastered secrets and been through experiences calculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for any scientist seeking natures hidden mysteriesurged by her uneasiness dalton became a still more frequent visitor at the clarendon home though he saw that his presence was deeply resented by surama the bony clinicman formed the habit of glaring peculiarly from those spectral sockets when admitting him and would often after closing the gate when he left chuckle monotonously in a manner that made his flesh creep meanwhile dr clarendon seemed oblivious of everything save his work at san quentin whither he went each day in his launchalone save for surama who managed the wheel while the doctor read or collated his notes dalton welcomed these regular absences for they gave him constant opportunities to renew his suit for georginas hand when he would overstay and meet alfred however the latters greeting was always friendly despite his habitual reserve in time the engagement of james and georgina grew to be a definite thing and the two awaited only a favourable chance to speak to alfredthe governor wholesouled in everything and firm in his protective loyalty spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friends behalf press and officialdom both felt his influence and he even succeeded in interesting scientists in the east many of whom came to california to study the plague and investigate the antifever bacillus which clarendon was so rapidly isolating and perfecting these doctors and biologists however did not obtain the information they wished so that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression not a few prepared articles hostile to clarendon accusing him of an unscientific and fameseeking attitude and intimating that he concealed his methods through a highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profitothers fortunately were more liberal in their judgments and wrote enthusiastically of clarendon and his work they had seen the patients and could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in leash his secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite justifiable since its public diffusion in unperfected form could not but do more harm than good clarendon himself whom many of their number had met before impressed them more profoundly than ever and they did not hesitate to compare him with jenner lister koch pasteur metchnikoff and the rest of those whose whole lives have served pathology and humanity dalton was careful to save for alfred all the magazines that spoke well of him bringing them in person as an excuse to see georgina they did not however produce much effect save a contemptuous smile and clarendon would generally throw them to surama whose deep disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a close parallel to the doctors own ironic amusementone monday evening early in february dalton called with the definite intention of asking clarendon for his sisters hand georgina herself admitted him to the grounds and as they walked toward the house he stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore paws on his breast it was dick georginas cherished st bernard and dalton was glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which meant so much to herdick was excited and glad and turned the governor nearly half about with his vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off through the trees toward the clinic he did not vanish though but presently stopped and looked back softly barking again as if he wished dalton to follow georgina fond of obeying her huge pets playful whims motioned to james to see what he wanted and they both walked slowly after him as he trotted relievedly to the rear of the yard where the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the stars above the great brick wallthe outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark windowcurtains so they knew that alfred and surama were at work suddenly from the interior came a thin subdued sound like a cry of a childa plaintive call of mamma mamma at which dick barked while james and georgina started perceptibly then georgina smiled remembering the parrots that clarendon always kept for experimental uses and patted dick on the head either to forgive him for having fooled her and dalton or to console him for having been fooled himselfas they turned slowly toward the house dalton mentioned his resolve to speak to alfred that evening about their engagement and georgina supplied no objection she knew that her brother would not relish the loss of a faithful manager and companion but believed his affection would place no barrier in the way of her happinesslater that evening clarendon came into the house with a springy step and aspect less grim than usual dalton seeing a good omen in this easy buoyancy took heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial ah jimmy hows politics this year he glanced at georgina and she quietly excused herself while the two men settled down to a chat on general subjects little by little amidst many reminders of their old youthful days dalton worked toward his point till at last he came out plainly with the crucial queryalf i want to marry georgina have we your blessingkeenly watching his old friend dalton saw a shadow steal over his face the dark eyes flashed for a moment then veiled themselves as wonted placidity returned so science or selfishness was at work after allyoure asking an impossibility james georgina isnt the aimless butterfly she was years ago she has a place in the service of truth and mankind now and that place is here shes decided to devote her life to my workto the household that makes my work possibleand theres no room for desertion or personal capricedalton waited to see if he had finished the same old fanaticismhumanity versus the individualand the doctor was going to let it spoil his sisters life then he tried to answerbut look here alf do you mean to say that georgina in particular is so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr of her use your sense of proportion man if it were a question of surama or somebody in the utter thick of your experiments it might be different but after all georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the last analysis she has promised to be my wife and says that she loves me have you the right to cut her off from the life that belongs to her have you the rightthatll do james clarendons face was set and white whether or not i have the right to govern my own family is no business of an outsideroutsideryou can say that to a man who dalton almost choked as the steely voice of the doctor interrupted him againan outsider to my family and from now on an outsider to my home dalton your presumption goes just a little too far good evening governorand clarendon strode from the room without extending his handdalton hesitated for a moment almost at a loss what to do when presently georgina entered her face shewed that she had spoken with her brother and dalton took both her hands impetuouslywell georgie what do you say im afraid its a choice between alf and me you know how i feelyou know how i felt before when it was your father i was up against whats your answer this timehe paused as she responded slowlyjames dear do you believe that i love youhe nodded and pressed her hands expectantlythen if you love me youll wait a while dont think of als rudeness hes to be pitied i cant tell you the whole thing now but you know how worried i amwhat with the strain of his work the criticisms and the staring and cackling of that horrible creature surama im afraid hell break downhe shews the strain more than anyone outside the family could tell i can see it for ive watched him all my life hes changingslowly bending under his burdensand he puts on his extra brusqueness to hide it you can see what i mean cant you dearshe paused and dalton nodded again pressing one of her hands to his breast then she concludedso promise me dear to be patient i must stand by him i must i mustdalton did not speak for a while but his head inclined in what was almost a bow of reverence there was more of christ in this devoted woman than he had thought any human being possessed and in the face of such love and loyalty he could do no urgingwords of sadness and parting were brief and james whose blue eyes were misty scarcely saw the gaunt clinicman as the gate to the street was at last opened to him but when it slammed to behind him he heard that bloodcurdling chuckle he had come to recognise so well and knew that surama was theresurama whom georgina had called her brothers evil genius walking away with a firm step dalton resolved to be watchful and to act at the first sign of troubleiiimeanwhile san francisco the epidemic still on the lips of all seethed with anticlarendon feeling actually the cases outside the penitentiary were very few and confined almost wholly to the lower mexican element whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitation to disease of every kind but politicians and the people needed no more than this to confirm the attacks made by the doctors enemies seeing that dalton was immovable in his championship of clarendon the malcontents medical dogmatists and wardheelers turned their attention to the state legislature lining up the anticlarendonists and the governors old enemies with great shrewdness and preparing to launch a lawwith a vetoproof majoritytransferring the authority for minor institutional appointments from the chief executive to the various boards or commissions concernedin the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than clarendons chief assistant dr jones jealous of his superior from the first he now saw an opportunity for turning matters to his liking and he thanked fate for the circumstanceresponsible indeed for his present positionof his relationship to the chairman of the prison board the new law if passed would certainly mean the removal of clarendon and the appointment of himself in his stead so mindful of his own interest he worked hard for it jones was all that clarendon was nota natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served his own advancement first and science only incidentally he was poor and avid for salaried position quite in contrast to the wealthy and independent savant he sought to displace so with a ratlike cunning and persistence he laboured to undermine the great biologist above him and was one day rewarded by the news that the new law was passed thenceforward the governor was powerless to make appointments to the state institutions and the medical directorship of san quentin lay at the disposal of the prison boardof all this legislative turmoil clarendon was singularly oblivious wrapped wholly in matters of administration and research he was blind to the treason of that ass jones who worked by his side and deaf to all the gossip of the wardens office he had never in his life read the newspapers and the banishment of dalton from his house cut off his last real link with the world of outside events with the naivet of a recluse he at no time thought of his position as insecure in view of daltons loyalty and of his forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs as shewn in his dealings with the elder clarendon who had crushed his father to death on the stock exchange the possibility of a gubernatorial dismissal was of course out of the question nor could the doctors political ignorance envisage a sudden shift of power which might place the matter of retention or dismissal in very different hands thereupon he merely smiled with satisfaction when dalton left for sacramento convinced that his place in san quentin and his sisters place in his household were alike secure from disturbance he was accustomed to having what he wanted and fancied his luck was still holding outthe first week in march a day or so after the enactment of the new law the chairman of the prison board called at san quentin clarendon was out but dr jones was glad to shew the august visitorhis own uncle incidentallythrough the great infirmary including the fever ward made so famous by press and panic by this time converted against his will to clarendons belief in the fevers noncontagiousness jones smilingly assured his uncle that nothing was to be feared and encouraged him to inspect the patients in detailespecially a ghastly skeleton once a very giant of bulk and vigour who was he insinuated slowly and painfully dying because clarendon would not administer the proper medicinedo you mean to say cried the chairman that dr clarendon refuses to let the man have what he needs knowing his life could be savedjust that snapped dr jones pausing as the door opened to admit none other than clarendon himself clarendon nodded coldly to jones and surveyed the visitor whom he did not know with disapprovaldr jones i thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at all and havent i said that visitors arent to be admitted except by special permissionbut the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce himpardon me dr clarendon but am i to understand that you refuse to give this man the medicine that would save himclarendon glared coldly and rejoined with steel in his voicethats an impertinent question sir i am in authority here and visitors are not allowed please leave the room at oncethe chairman his sense of drama secretly tickled answered with greater pomp and hauteur than were necessaryyou mistake me sir i not you am master here you are addressing the chairman of the prison board i must say moreover that i deem your activity a menace to the welfare of the prisoners and must request your resignation henceforth dr jones will be in charge and if you wish to remain until your formal dismissal you will take your orders from himit was wilfred joness great moment life never gave him another such climax and we need not grudge him this one after all he was a small rather than a bad man and he had only obeyed a small mans code of looking to himself at all costs clarendon stood still gazing at the speaker as if he thought him mad till in another second the look of triumph on dr joness face convinced him that something important was indeed afoot he was icily courteous as he repliedno doubt you are what you claim to be sir but fortunately my appointment came from the governor of the state and can therefore be revoked only by himthe chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly for they had not realised to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go then the older man grasping the situation explained at some lengthhad i found that the current reports did you an injustice he concluded i would have deferred action but the case of this poor man and your own arrogant manner left me no choice as it isbut dr clarendon interrupted with a new razorsharpness in his voiceas it is i am the director in charge at present and i ask you to leave this room at oncethe chairman reddened and explodedlook here sir who do you think youre talking to ill have you chucked out of heredamn your impertinencebut he had time only to finish the sentence transformed by the insult to a sudden dynamo of hate the slender scientist launched out with both fists in a burst of preternatural strength of which no one would have thought him capable and if his strength was preternatural his accuracy of aim was no less so for not even a champion of the ring could have wrought a neater result both menthe chairman and dr joneswere squarely hit the one full in the face and the other on the point of the chin going down like felled trees they lay motionless and unconscious on the floor while clarendon now clear and completely master of himself took his hat and cane and went out to join surama in the launch only when seated in the moving boat did he at last give audible vent to the frightful rage that consumed him then with face convulsed he called down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs beyond the stars so that even surama shuddered made an elder sign that no book of history records and forgot to chuckleivgeorgina soothed her brothers hurt as best she could he had come home mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library lounge and in that gloomy room little by little the faithful sister had taken in the almost incredible news her consolations were instantaneous and tender and she made him realise how vast though unconscious a tribute to his greatness the attacks persecution and dismissal all were he had tried to cultivate the indifference she preached and could have done so had personal dignity alone been involved but the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could calmly bear and he sighed again and again as he repeated how three months more of study in the prison might have given him at last the longsought bacillus which would make all fever a thing of the pastthen georgina tried another mode of cheering and told him that surely the prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate or if it broke out with increased force but even this was ineffective and clarendon answered only in a string of bitter ironic and halfmeaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how deeply despair and resentment had bittenabate break out again oh itll abate all right at least theyll think it has abated theyd think anything no matter what happens ignorant eyes see nothing and bunglers are never discoverers science never shews her face to that sort and they call themselves doctors best of all fancy that ass jones in chargeceasing with a quick sneer he laughed so daemoniacally that georgina shiveredthe days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the clarendon mansion depression stark and unrelieved had taken hold of the doctors usually tireless mind and he would even have refused food had not georgina forced it upon him his great notebook of observations lay unopened on the library table and his little gold syringe of antifever seruma clever device of his own with a selfcontained reservoir attached to a broad gold finger ring and singlepressure action peculiar to itselfrested idly in a small leather case beside it vigour ambition and the desire for study and observation seemed to have died within him and he made no inquiries about his clinic where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderly phials awaiting his attentionthe countless animals held for experiments played lively and well fed in the early spring sunshine and as georgina strolled out through the rosearbour to the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of happiness about her she knew though how tragically transient that happiness must be since the start of new work would soon make all these small creatures unwilling martyrs to science knowing this she glimpsed a sort of compensating element in her brothers inaction and encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly the eight thibetan servants moved noiselessly about each as impeccably effective as usual and georgina saw to it that the order of the household did not suffer because of the masters relaxationstudy and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressinggowned indifference clarendon was content to let georgina treat him as an infant he met her maternal fussiness with a slow sad smile and always obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts a kind of faint wistful felicity came over the languid household amidst which the only dissenting note was supplied by surama he indeed was miserable and looked often with sullen and resentful eyes at the sunny serenity in georginas face his only joy had been the turmoil of experiment and he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals bearing them to the clinic in clutching talons and watching them with hot brooding gaze and evil chuckles as they gradually fell into the final coma with wideopened redrimmed eyes and swollen tongue lolling from frothcovered mouthnow he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree creatures in their cages and frequently came to ask clarendon if there were any orders finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin work he would go away muttering under his breath and glaring curses upon everything stealing with catlike tread to his own quarters in the basement where his voice would sometimes ascend in deep muffled rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortably ritualistic suggestionall this wore on georginas nerves but not by any means so gravely as her brothers continued lassitude itself the duration of the state alarmed her and little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness which had so provoked the clinicman herself skilled in medicine she found the doctors condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienists point of view and she now feared as much from his absence of interest and activity as she had formerly feared from his fanatical zeal and overstudy was lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant man of intellect into an innocuous imbecilethen toward the end of may came the sudden change georgina always recalled the smallest details connected with it details as trivial as the box delivered to surama the day before postmarked algiers and emitting a most unpleasant odour and the sharp sudden thunderstorm rare in the extreme for california which sprang up that night as surama chanted his rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning chestvoice louder and more intense than usualit was a sunny day and she had been in the garden gathering flowers for the diningroom reentering the house she glimpsed her brother in the library fully dressed and seated at the table alternately consulting the notes in his thick observation book and making fresh entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen he was alert and vital and there was a satisfying resilience about his movements as he now and then turned a page or reached for a book from the rear of the great table delighted and relieved georgina hastened to deposit her flowers in the diningroom and return but when she reached the library again she found that her brother was goneshe knew of course that he must be in the clinic at work and rejoiced to think that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into place realising it would be of no use to delay the luncheon for him she ate alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in case of his return at an odd moment but he did not come he was making up for lost time and was still in the great stoutplanked clinic when she went for a stroll through the rosearbouras she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw surama fetching animals for the test she wished she could notice him less for he always made her shudder but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and ears where he was concerned he always went hatless around the yard and the total hairlessness of his head enhanced his skeletonlike aspect horribly now she heard a faint chuckle as he took a small monkey from its cage against the wall and carried it to the clinic his long bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it cried out in frightened anguish the sight sickened her and brought her walk to an end her inmost soul rebelled at the ascendancy this creature had gained over her brother and she reflected bitterly that the two had almost changed places as master and servantnight came without clarendons return to the house and georgina concluded that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions which meant total disregard of time she hated to retire without a talk with him about his sudden recovery but finally feeling it would be futile to wait up she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his chair on the library table then started resolutely for bedshe was not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut so it had not been an allnight session after all determined to see that her brother had a meal before retiring she rose slipped on a robe and descended to the library halting only when she heard voices from behind the halfopened door clarendon and surama were talking and she waited till the clinicman might gosurama however shewed no inclination to depart and indeed the whole heated tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise length georgina though she had not meant to listen could not help catching a phrase now and then and presently became aware of a sinister undercurrent which frightened her very much without being wholly clear to her her brothers voice nervous incisive held her notice with disquieting persistencebut anyway he was saying we havent enough animals for another day and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short notice it seems silly to waste so much effort on comparative trash when human specimens could be had with just a little extra caregeorgina sickened at the possible implication and caught at the hall rack to steady herself surama was replying in that deep hollow tone which seemed to echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand planetssteady steadywhat a child you are with your haste and impatience you crowd things so when youve lived as i have so that a whole life will seem only an hour you wont be so fretful about a day or week or month you work too fast youve plenty of specimens in the cages for a full week if youll only go at a sensible rate you might even begin on the older material if youd be sure not to overdo itnever mind my haste the reply was snapped out sharply i have my own methods i dont want to use our material if i can help it for i prefer them as they are and youd better be careful of them anywayyou know the knives those sly dogs carrysuramas deep chuckle camedont worry about that the brutes eat dont they well i can get you one any time you need it but go slowwith the boy gone there are only eight and now that youve lost san quentin itll be hard to get new ones by the wholesale id advise you to start in on tsanpohes the least use to you as he is andbut that was all georgina heard transfixed by a hideous dread from the thoughts this talk excited she nearly sank to the floor where she stood and was scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her room what was the evil monster surama planning into what was he guiding her brother what monstrous circumstances lay behind these cryptic sentences a thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced before her eyes and she flung herself upon the bed without hope of sleep one thought above the rest stood out with fiendish prominence and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her brain with renewed force then nature kinder than she expected intervened at last closing her eyes in a dead faint she did not awake till morning nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the overheard words had broughtwith the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension what happens in the night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in distorted forms and georgina could see that her brain must have given strange colour to scraps of common medical conversation to suppose her brotheronly son of the gentle frances schuyler clarendonguilty of savage sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to their blood and she decided to omit all mention of her trip downstairs lest alfred ridicule her fantastic notionswhen she reached the breakfast table she found that clarendon was already gone and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance to congratulate him on his revived activity quietly taking the breakfast served by stonedeaf old margarita the mexican cook she read the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the sittingroom window overlooking the great yard all was silent out there and she could see that the last of the animal cages had been emptied science was served and the limepit held all that was left of the once pretty and lively little creatures this slaughter had always grieved her but she had never complained since she knew it was all for humanity being a scientists sister she used to say to herself was like being the sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen from their foesafter luncheon georgina resumed her post by the window and had been busily sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the yard caused her to look out in alarm there not far from the clinic she saw the ghastly form of surama a revolver in his hand and his skullface twisted into a strange expression as he chuckled at a cowering figure robed in black silk and carrying a long thibetan knife it was the servant tsanpo and as she recognised the shrivelled face georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the night before the sun flashed on the polished blade and suddenly suramas revolver spat once more this time the knife flew from the mongols hand and surama glanced greedily at his shaking and bewildered preythen tsanpo glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen knife sprang nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinicman and made a dash for the house surama however was too swift for him and caught him in a single leap seizing his shoulder and almost crushing him for a moment the thibetan tried to struggle but surama lifted him like an animal by the scruff of the neck and bore him off toward the clinic georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the man in his own tongue and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver with fright suddenly realising against her own will what was taking place a great horror mastered her and she fainted for the second time within twentyfour hourswhen consciousness returned the golden light of late afternoon was flooding the room georgina picking up her fallen workbasket and scattered materials was lost in a daze of doubt but finally felt convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have been all too tragically real her worst fears then were horrible truths what to do about it nothing in her experience could tell her and she was vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear she must talk to him but not now she could not talk to anybody now and thinking shudderingly of the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic windows she crept into bed for a long night of anguished sleeplessnessrising haggardly on the following day georgina saw the doctor for the first time since his recovery he was bustling about preoccupiedly circulating between the house and the clinic and paying little attention to anything besides his work there was no chance for the dreaded interview and clarendon did not even notice his sisters wornout aspect and hesitant mannerin the evening she heard him in the library talking to himself in a fashion most unusual for him and she felt that he was under a great strain which might culminate in the return of his apathy entering the room she tried to calm him without referring to any trying subject and forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him finally she asked gently what was distressing him and waited anxiously for his reply hoping to hear that suramas treatment of the poor thibetan had horrified and outraged himthere was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he respondedwhats distressing me good god georgina whatisntlook at the cages and see if you have to ask again cleaned outmilked drynot a cursed specimen left and a line of the most important bacterial cultures incubating in their tubes without a chance to do an ounce of good days work wastedwhole programme set backits enough to drive a man mad how shall i ever get anywhere if i cant scrape up some decent subjectsgeorgina stroked his foreheadi think you ought to rest a while al dearhe moved awayrest thats good thats damn good what else have i been doing but resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last fifty or a hundred or a thousand years just as i manage to shake off the clouds i have to run short of materialand then im told to lapse back again into drooling stupefaction god and all the while some sneaking thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to come out ahead of me with the credit for my own work ill lose by a necksome fool with the proper specimens will get the prize when one week more with even halfadequate facilities would see me through with flying colourshis voice rose querulously and there was an overtone of mental strain which georgina did not like she answered softly yet not so softly as to hint at the soothing of a psychopathic casebut youre killing yourself with this worry and tension and if youre dead how can you do your workhe gave a smile that was almost a sneeri guess a week or a monthall the time i needwouldnt quite finish me and it doesnt much matter what becomes of me or any other individual in the end science is what must be servedsciencethe austere cause of human knowledge im like the monkeys and birds and guineapigs i usejust a cog in the machine to be used to the advantage of the whole they had to be killedi may have to be killedwhat of it isnt the cause we serve worth that and moregeorgina sighed for a moment she wondered whether after all this ceaseless round of slaughter really was worth whilebut are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to humanity to warrant these sacrificesclarendons eyes flashed dangerouslyhumanity what the deuce is humanity science dolts just individuals over and over again humanity is made for preachers to whom it means the blindly credulous humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom it speaks in terms of dollars and cents humanity is made for the politician to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his advantage what is humanity nothing thank god that crude illusion doesnt last what a grown man worships is truthknowledgesciencelightthe rending of the veil and the pushing back of the shadow knowledge the juggernaut there is death in our own ritual we must killdissectdestroyand all for the sake of discoverythe worship of the ineffable light the goddess science demands it we test a doubtful poison by killing how else no thought for selfjust knowledgethe effect must be knownhis voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion and georgina shuddered slightlybut this is horrible al you shouldnt think of it that wayclarendon cackled sardonically in a manner which stirred odd and repugnant associations in his sisters mindhorrible you think whatisay is horrible you ought to hear surama i tell you things were known to the priests of atlantis that would have you drop dead of fright if you heard a hint of them knowledge was knowledge a hundred thousand years ago when our especial forbears were shambling about asia as speechless semiapes they know something of it in the hoggar regionthere are rumours in the farther uplands of thibetand once i heard an old man in china calling on yogsothothhe turned pale and made a curious sign in the air with his extended forefinger georgina felt genuinely alarmed but became somewhat calmer as his speech took a less fantastic formyes it may be horrible but its glorious too the pursuit of knowledge i mean certainly theres no slovenly sentiment connected with it doesnt nature killconstantly and remorselesslyand are any but fools horrified at the struggle killings are necessary they are the glory of science we learn something from them and we cant sacrifice learning to sentiment hear the sentimentalists howl against vaccination they fear it will kill the child well what if it does how else can we discover the laws of disease concerned as a scientists sister you ought to know better than to prate sentiment you ought to help my work instead of hindering itbut al protested georgina i havent the slightest intention of hindering your work havent i always tried to help as much as i could i am ignorant i suppose and cant help very actively but at least im proud of youproud for my own sake and for the familys sakeand ive always tried to smooth the way youve given me credit for that many a timeclarendon looked at her keenlyyes he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room youre right youve always tried to help as best you knew you may yet have a chance to help still moregeorgina seeing him disappear through the front door followed him into the yard some distance away a lantern was shining through the trees and as they approached it they saw surama bending over a large object stretched on the ground clarendon advancing gave a short grunt but when georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek it was dick the great st bernard and he was lying still with reddened eyes and protruding tonguehes sick al she cried do something for him quickthe doctor looked at surama who had uttered something in a tongue unknown to georginatake him to the clinic he ordered im afraid dicks caught the feversurama took up the dog as he had taken poor tsanpo the day before and carried him silently to the building near the wall he did not chuckle this time but glanced at clarendon with what appeared to be real anxiety it almost seemed to georgina that surama was asking the doctor to save her petclarendon however made no move to follow but stood still for a moment and then sauntered slowly toward the house georgina astonished at such callousness kept up a running fire of entreaties on dicks behalf but it was of no use without paying the slightest attention to her pleas he made directly for the library and began to read in a large old book which had lain face down on the table she put her hand on his shoulder as he sat there but he did not speak or turn his head he only kept on reading and georgina glancing curiously over his shoulder wondered in what strange alphabet this brassbound tome was writtenin the cavernous parlour across the hall sitting alone in the dark a quarter of an hour later georgina came to her decision something was gravely wrongjust what and to what extent she scarcely dared formulate to herselfand it was time that she called in some stronger force to help her of course it must be james he was powerful and capable and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing to do he had known al always and would understandit was by this time rather late but georgina had resolved on action across the hall the light still shone from the library and she looked wistfully at the doorway as she quietly donned a hat and left the house outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds it was only a short walk to jackson street where by good luck she found a carriage to take her to the western union telegraph office there she carefully wrote out a message to james dalton in sacramento asking him to come at once to san francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them allvdalton was frankly perplexed by georginas sudden message he had had no word from the clarendons since that stormy february evening when alfred had declared him an outsider to his home and he in turn had studiously refrained from communicating even when he had longed to express sympathy after the doctors summary ousting from office he had fought hard to frustrate the politicians and keep the appointive power and was bitterly sorry to watch the unseating of a man who despite recent estrangements still represented to him the ultimate ideal of scientific competencenow with this clearly frightened summons before him he could not imagine what had happened he knew though that georgina was not one to lose her head or send forth a needless alarm hence he wasted no time but took the overland which left sacramento within the hour going at once to his club and sending word to georgina by a messenger that he was in town and wholly at her servicemeanwhile things had been quiescent at the clarendon home notwithstanding the doctors continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dogs condition shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening but for the moment there was a lull georgina was relieved to get daltons message and learn that he was close at hand and sent back word that she would call him when necessity arose amidst all the gathering tension some faint compensating element seemed manifest and georgina finally decided that it was the absence of the lean thibetans whose stealthy sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect had always annoyed her they had vanished all at once and old margarita the sole visible servant left in the house told her they were helping their master and surama at the clinicthe following morningthe twentyeighth of maylong to be rememberedwas dark and lowering and georgina felt the precarious calm wearing thin she did not see her brother at all but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at something despite the lack of specimens he had bewailed she wondered how poor tsanpo was getting along and whether he had really been subjected to any serious inoculation but it must be confessed that she wondered more about dick she longed to know whether surama had done anything for the faithful dog amidst his masters oddly callous indifference suramas apparent solicitude on the night of dicks seizure had impressed her greatly giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she had ever had for the detested clinicman now as the day advanced she found herself thinking more and more of dick till at last her harassed nerves finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the whole horror that lay upon the household could stand the suspense no longerup to that time she had always respected alfreds imperious wish that he be never approached or disturbed at the clinic but as this fateful afternoon advanced her resolution to break through the barrier grew stronger and stronger finally she set out with determined face crossing the yard and entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden structure with the fixed intention of discovering how the dog was or of knowing the reason for her brothers secrecythe inner door as usual was locked and behind it she heard voices in heated conversation when her knocking brought no response she rattled the knob as loudly as possible but still the voices argued on unheeding they belonged of course to surama and her brother and as she stood there trying to attract attention she could not help catch something of their drift fate had made her for the second time an eavesdropper and once more the matter she overheard seemed likely to tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds alfred and surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence and the purport of their speech was enough to arouse the wildest fears and confirm the gravest apprehensions georgina shivered as her brothers voice mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical tensionyou damn youyoure a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me who started all this anyway didihave any idea of your cursed devilgods and elder world didiever in my life think of your damned spaces beyond the stars and your crawling chaos nyarlathotep i was a normal scientific man confound you till i was fool enough to drag you out of the vaults with your devilish atlantean secrets you egged me on and now you want to cut me off you loaf around doing nothing and telling me to go slow when you

had worshipped at the underground shrines of nug and yebi shubnigguraththrough clarendons shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the clinicmanshut up you fool do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any weight with me words and formulaewords and formulaewhat do they all mean to one who has the substance behind them were in a material sphere now and subject to material laws you have your fever i have my revolver youll get no specimens and ill get no fever so long as i have you in front of me with this gun betweenthat was all georgina could hear she felt her senses reeling and staggered out of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering outside air she saw that the crisis had come at last and that help must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be saved from the unknown gulfs of madness and mystery summoning up all her reserve energy she managed to reach the house and get to the library where she scrawled a hasty note for margarita to take to james daltonwhen the old woman had gone georgina had just strength enough to cross to the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semistupor there she lay for what seemed like years conscious only of the fantastic creeping up of the twilight from the lower corners of the great dismal room and plagued by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed with phantasmal halflimned pageantry through her tortured and stifled brain dusk deepened into darkness and still the spell held then a firm tread sounded in the hall and she heard someone enter the room and fumble at the matchsafe her heart almost stopped beating as the gasjets of the chandelier flared up one by one but then she saw that the arrival was her brother relieved to the bottom of her heart that he was still alive she gave vent to an involuntary sigh profound longdrawn and tremulous and lapsed at last into kindly oblivionat the sound of that sigh clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge and was inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of his sister there her face had a deathlike quality that frightened his inmost spirit and he flung himself on his knees by her side awake to a realisation of what her passing away would mean to him long unused to private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth he had lost the physicians instinct of first aid and could only call out her name and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him then he thought of water and ran to the diningroom for a carafe stumbling about in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors he was some time in finding what he sought but at last he clutched it in shaking hand and hastened back to dash the cold fluid in georginas face the method was crude but effective she stirred sighed a second time and finally opened her eyesyou are alive he cried and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his head maternally she was almost glad she fainted for the circumstance seemed to have dispelled the strange alfred and brought her own brother back to her she sat up slowly and tried to reassure himim all right al just give me a glass of water its a sin to waste it this wayto say nothing of spoiling my waist is that the way to behave every time your sister drops off for a nap you neednt think im going to be sick for i havent time for such nonsensealfreds eyes shewed that her cool commonsense speech had had its effect his brotherly panic dissolved in an instant and instead there came into his face a vague calculating expression as if some marvellous possibility had just dawned upon him as she watched the subtle waves of cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she became less and less certain that her mode of reassurance had been a wise one and before he spoke she found herself shivering at something she could not define a keen medical instinct almost told her that his moment of sanity had passed and that he was now once more the unrestrained fanatic for scientific research there was something morbid in the quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mention of good health what was he thinking to what unnatural extreme was his passion for experiment about to be pushed wherein lay the special significance of her pure blood and absolutely flawless organic state none of these misgivings however troubled georgina for more than a second and she was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her brothers steady fingers at her pulseyoure a bit feverish georgie he said in a precise elaborately restrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyeswhy nonsense im all right she replied one would think you were on the watch for fever patients just for the sake of shewing off your discovery itwouldbe poetic though if you could make your final proof and demonstration by curing your own sisterclarendon started violently and guiltily had she suspected his wish had he muttered anything aloud he looked at her closely and saw that she had no inkling of the truth she smiled up sweetly into his face and patted his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge then he took a small oblong leather case from his vest pocket and taking out a little gold syringe he began fingering it thoughtfully pushing the piston speculatively in and out of the empty cylinderi wonder he began with suave sententiousness whether you would really be willing to help science insomething like that wayif the need arose whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to the cause of medicine as a sort of jephthahs daughter if you knew it meant the absolute perfection and completion of my workgeorgina catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brothers eyes knew at last that her worst fears were true there was nothing to do now but keep him quiet at all hazards and to pray that margarita had found james dalton at his clubyou look tired al dear she said gently why not take a little morphia and get some of the sleep you need so badlyhe replied with a kind of crafty deliberationyes youre right im worn out and so are you each of us needs a good sleep morphine is just the thingwait till i go and fill the syringe and well both take a proper dosestill fingering the empty syringe he walked softly out of the room georgina looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation ears alert for any sign of possible help she thought she heard margarita again in the basement kitchen and rose to ring the bell in an effort to learn of the fate of her message the old servant answered her summons at once and declared she had given the message at the club hours ago governor dalton had been out but the clerk had promised to deliver the note at the very moment of his arrivalmargarita waddled below stairs again but still clarendon did not reappear what was he doing what was he planning she had heard the outer door slam so knew he must be at the clinic had he forgotten his original intention with the vacillating mind of madness the suspense grew almost unbearable and georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid screamingit was the gate bell which rang simultaneously in house and clinic that broke the tension at last she heard the catlike tread of surama on the walk as he left the clinic to answer it and then with an almost hysterical sigh of relief she caught the firm familiar accents of dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant rising she almost tottered to meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway and for a moment no word was spoken while he kissed her hand in his courtly oldschool fashion then georgina burst forth into a torrent of hurried explanation telling all that had happened all she had glimpsed and overheard and all she feared and suspecteddalton listened gravely and comprehendingly his first bewilderment gradually giving place to astonishment sympathy and resolution the message held by a careless clerk had been slightly delayed and had found him appropriately enough in the midst of a warm loungingroom discussion about clarendon a fellowmember dr macneil had brought in a medical journal with an article well calculated to disturb the devoted scientist and dalton had just asked to keep the paper for future reference when the message was handed him at last abandoning his halfformed plan to take dr macneil into his confidence regarding alfred he called at once for his hat and stick and lost not a moment in getting a cab for the clarendon homesurama he thought appeared alarmed at recognising him though he had chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic dalton always recalled suramas stride and chuckle on this ominous night for he was never to see the unearthly creature again as the chuckler entered the clinic vestibule his deep guttural gurgles seemed to blend with some low mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizonwhen dalton had heard all georgina had to say and learned that alfred was expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine he decided he had better talk with the doctor alone advising georgina to retire to her room and await developments he walked about the gloomy library scanning the shelves and listening for clarendons nervous footstep on the clinic path outside the vast rooms corners were dismal despite the chandelier and the closer dalton looked at his friends choice of books the less he liked them it was not the balanced collection of a normal physician biologist or man of general culture there were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes dark speculations and forbidden rituals of the middle ages and strange exotic mysteries in alien alphabets both known and unknownthe great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome too the handwriting had a neurotic cast and the spirit of the entries was far from reassuring long passages were inscribed in crabbed greek characters and as dalton marshalled his linguistic memory for their translation he gave a sudden start and wished his college struggles with xenophon and homer had been more conscientious there was something wrongsomething hideously wronghere and the governor sank limply into the chair by the table as he pored more and more closely over the doctors barbarous greek then a sound came startlingly near and he jumped nervously at a hand laid sharply on his shoulderwhat may i ask is the cause of this intrusion you might have stated your business to suramaclarendon was standing icily by the chair the little gold syringe in one hand he seemed very calm and rational and dalton fancied for a moment that georgina must have exaggerated his condition how too could a rusty scholar be absolutely sure about these greek entries the governor decided to be very cautious in his interview and thanked the lucky chance which had placed a specious pretext in his coat pocket he was very cool and assured as he rose to replyi didnt think youd care to have things dragged before a subordinate but i thought you ought to see this article at oncehe drew forth the magazine given him by dr macneil and handed it to clarendonon page 542you see the heading black fever conquered by new serum its by dr miller of philadelphiaand he thinks hes got ahead of you with your cure they were discussing it at the club and macneil thought the exposition very convincing i as a layman couldnt pretend to judge but at all events i thought you oughtnt to miss a chance to digest the thing while its fresh if youre busy of course i wont disturb youclarendon cut in sharplyim going to give my sister an hypodermicshes not quite wellbut ill look at what that quack has to say when i get back i know millera damn sneak and incompetentand i dont believe he has the brains to steal my methods from the little hes seen of themdalton suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that georgina must not receive that intended dose there was something sinister about it from what she had said alfred must have been inordinately long preparing it far longer than was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet he decided to hold his host as long as possible meanwhile testing his attitude in a more or less subtle wayim sorry georgina isnt well are you sure that the injection will do her good that it wont do her any harmclarendons spasmodic start shewed that something had been struck homedo her harm he cried dont be absurd you know georgina must be in the best of healththe very best i sayin order to serve science as a clarendon should serve it she at least appreciates the fact that she is my sister she deems no sacrifice too great in my service she is a priestess of truth and discovery as i am a priesthe paused in his shrill tirade wildeyed and somewhat out of breath dalton could see that his attention had been momentarily shiftedbut let me see what this cursed quack has to say he continued if he thinks his pseudomedical rhetoric can take a real doctor in he is even simpler than i thoughtclarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood there clutching his syringe dalton wondered what the real facts were macneil had assured him that the author was a pathologist of the highest standing and that whatever errors the article might have the mind behind it was powerful erudite and absolutely honourable and sincerewatching the doctor as he read dalton saw the thin bearded face grow pale the great eyes blazed and the pages crackled in the tenser grip of the long lean fingers a perspiration broke out on the high ivorywhite forehead where the hair was already thinning and the reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept on with his devouring of the text then came a wild scream as from a haunted beast and clarendon lurched forward on the table his outflung arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousness went dark like a windquenched candleflamedalton springing to help his stricken friend raised the slim form and tilted it back in the chair seeing the carafe on the floor near the lounge he dashed some water into the twisted face and was rewarded by seeing the large eyes slowly open they were sane eyes nowdeep and sad and unmistakably saneand dalton felt awed in the presence of a tragedy whose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumbthe golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand and as clarendon drew a deep shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and studied the glittering thing that rolled about on his palm then he spokeslowly and with the ineffable sadness of utter absolute despairthanks jimmy im quite all right but theres much to be done you asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do georgie any harm im in a position now to tell you that it wonthe turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston at the same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own neck dalton cried out in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand injected the contents of the cylinder into the ridge of distended fleshgood lord al what have you doneclarendon smiled gentlya smile almost of peace and resignation different indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeksyou ought to know jimmy if youve still the judgment that made you a governor you must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise that theres nothing else to do with your marks in greek back at columbia i guess you couldnt have missed much all i can say is that its truejames i dont like to pass blame along but its only right to tell you that surama got me into this i cant tell you who or what he is for i dont fully know myself and what i do know is stuff that no sane person ought to know but i will say that i dont consider him a human being in the fullest sense and that im not sure whether or not hes alive as we know lifeyou think im talking nonsense i wish i were but the whole hideous mess is damnably real i started out in life with a clean mind and purpose i wanted to rid the world of fever i tried and failedand i wish to god i had been honest enough to say that id failed dont let my old talk of science deceive you jamesi found no antitoxin and was never even half on the track of onedont look so shaken up old fellow a veteran politicianfighter like you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before i tell you i never had even the start of a fever cure but my studies had taken me into some queer places and it was just my damned luck to listen to the stories of some still queerer people james if you ever wish any man well tell him to keep clear of the ancient hidden places of the earth old backwaters are dangerousthings are handed down there that dont do healthy people any good i talked too much with old priests and mystics and got to hoping i might achieve things in dark ways that i couldnt achieve in lawful waysi shant tell you just what i mean for if i did id be as bad as the old priests that were the ruin of me all i need say is that after what ive learned i shudder at the thought of the world and what its been through the world is cursed old james and there have been whole chapters lived and closed before the dawn of our organic life and the geologic eras connected with it its an awful thoughtwhole forgotten cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseasesall lived through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the tropic seas geology tells us abouti said gone but i didnt quite mean that it would have been better that way but it wasnt quite so in places traditions have kept oni cant tell you howand certain archaic lifeforms have managed to struggle thinly down the aeons in hidden spots there were cults you knowbands of evil priests in lands now buried under the sea atlantis was the hotbed that was a terrible place if heaven is merciful no one will ever drag up that horror from the deepit had a colony though that didnt sink and when you get too confidential with one of the tuareg priests in africa hes likely to tell you wild tales about ittales that connect up with whispers youll hear among the mad lamas and flighty yakdrivers on the secret tablelands of asia id heard all the common tales and whispers when i came on the big one what that was youll never knowbut it pertained to somebody or something that had come down from a blasphemously long time ago and could be made to live againor seem alive againthrough certain processes that werent very clear to the man who told menow james in spite of my confession about the fever you know im not bad as a doctor i plugged hard at medicine and soaked up about as much as the next manmaybe a little more because down there in the hoggar country i did something no priest had ever been able to do they led me blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for generationsand i came back with suramaeasy james i know what you want to say how does he know all he knowswhy does he speak englishor any other language for that matterwithout an accentwhy did he come away with meand all that i cant tell you altogether but i can say that he takes in ideas and images and impressions with something besides his brain and senses he had a use for me and my science he told me things and opened up vistas he taught me to worship ancient primordial and unholy gods and mapped out a road to a terrible goal which i cant even hint to you dont press me jamesits for the sake of your sanity and the worlds sanitythe creature is beyond all bounds hes in league with the stars and all the forces of nature dont think im still crazy jamesi swear to you im not ive had too many glimpses to doubt he gave me new pleasures that were forms of his palaeogean worship and the greatest of those was the black fevergod james havent you seen through the business by this time do you still believe the black fever came out of thibet and that i learned about it there use your brains man look at millers article here hes found a basic antitoxin that will end all fever within half a century when other men learn how to modify it for the different forms hes cut the ground of my youth from under medone what id have given my life to dotaken the wind out of all the honest sails i ever flung to the breeze of science do you wonder his article gave me a turn do you wonder it shocks me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my youth too late too late but not too late to save othersi guess im rambling a bit now old man you knowthe hypodermic i asked you why you didnt tumble to the facts about black fever how could you though doesnt miller say hes cured seven cases with his serum a matter of diagnosis james he only thinks it is black fever i can read between his lines here old chap on page 551 is the key to the whole thing read it againyou see dont you the fever casesfrom the pacific coastdidnt respond to his serum they puzzled him they didnt even seem like any true fever he knew well those weremycases those were therealblack fever cases and there cant ever be an antitoxin on earth thatll cure black feverhow do i knowbecause black fever isnt of this earthits fromsomewhere elsejamesand surama alone knows where because he brought it here hebrought it and i spread itthats the secret james thats all i wanted the appointment forthats all i ever didjust spread the fever that i carried in this gold syringe and in the deadlier fingerringpumpsyringe you see on my index fingerscience a blind i wanted to kill and kill and kill a single pressure on my finger and the black fever was inoculated i wanted to see living things writhe and squirm scream and froth at the mouth a single pressure of the pumpsyringe and i could watch them as they died and i couldnt live or think unless i had plenty to watch thats why i jabbed everything in sight with the accursed hollow needle animals criminals children servantsand the next would have beenclarendons voice broke and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chairthatthat jameswasmy life surama made it sohe taught me and kept me at it till i couldnt stop thenthen it got too mucheven for himhe tried to check me fancyhetrying to check anybody in that line but now ive got my last specimen that is my last test good subject jamesim healthydevilish healthy deuced ironic thoughthe madness has gone now so there wont be any fun watching the agony cant becanta violent shiver of fever racked the doctor and dalton mourned amidst his horrorstupefaction that he could give no grief how much of alfreds story was sheer nonsense and how much nightmare truth he could not say but in any case he felt that the man was a victim rather than a criminal and above all he was a boyhood comrade and georginas brother thoughts of the old days came back kaleidoscopically little alfthe yard at phillips exeterthe quadrangle at columbiathe fight with tom cortland when he saved alf from a pommeling he helped clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do there was nothing alfred could only whisper now but he asked forgiveness for all his offences and commended his sister to the care of his friendyouyoullmake her happy he gasped she deserves it martyrtoa myth make it up to her james dontletherknowmorethan she has tohis voice trailed off in a mumble and he fell into a stupor dalton rang the bell but margarita had gone to bed so he called up the stairs for georgina she was firm of step but very pale alfreds scream had tried her sorely but she had trusted james she trusted him still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge and asked her to go back to her room and rest no matter what sounds she might hear he did not wish her to witness the awful spectacle of delirium certain to come but bade her kiss her brother a final farewell as he lay there calm and still very like the delicate boy he had once been so she left himthe strange moonstruck starreading genius she had mothered so longand the picture she carried away was a very merciful onedalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture his fears of delirium were not vain and all through the black midnight hours his giant strength restrained the frenzied contortions of the mad sufferer what he heard from those swollen blackening lips he will never repeat he has never been quite the same man since and he knows that no one who hears such things can ever be wholly as he was before so for the worlds good he dares not speak and he thanks god that his laymans ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic and meaningless to himtoward morning clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and began to speak in a firm voicejames i didnt tell you what must be doneabout everything blot out these entries in greek and send my notebook to dr miller all my other notes too that youll find in the files hes the big authority todayhis article proves it your friend at the club was rightbut everything in the clinic must goeverything without exception dead or alive orotherwiseall the plagues of hell are in those bottles on the shelves burn themburn it allif one thing escapes surama will spread black death throughout the worldand above all burn suramathatthatthingmust not breathe the wholesome air of heaven you know nowwhat i told youyou know why such an entity cant be allowed on earth it wont be murdersurama isnt humanif youre as pious as you used to be james i shant have to urge you remember the old textthou shalt not suffer a witch to liveor something of the sortburn him jamesdont let him chuckle again over the torture of mortal flesh i sayburn himthe nemesis of flamethats all that can reach him james unless you can catch him asleep and drive a stake through his heart kill himextirpate himcleanse the decent universe of its primal taintthe taint i recalled from its agelong sleep the doctor had risen on his elbow and his voice was a piercing shriek toward the last the effort was too much however and he lapsed very suddenly into a deep tranquil coma dalton himself fearless of fever since he knew the dread germ to be noncontagious composed alfreds arms and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragile form after all mightnt much of this horror be exaggeration and delirium mightnt old doc macneil pull him through on a long chance the governor strove to keep awake and walked briskly up and down the room but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures a seconds rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands and he was presently sleeping soundly despite his best intentionsdalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes and for a moment he thought the dawn had come but it was not the dawn and as he rubbed his heavy lids he saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in the yard whose stout planks flamed and roared and crackled heavenward in the most stupendous holocaust he had ever seen it was indeed the nemesis of flame that clarendon had wished and dalton felt that some strange combustibles must be involved in a blaze so much wilder than anything normal pine or redwood could afford he glanced alarmedly at the lounge but alfred was not there starting up he went to call georgina but met her in the hall roused as he was by the mountain of living firethe clinics burning down she cried how is al nowhes disappeareddisappeared while i dropped asleep replied dalton reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to swaygently leading her upstairs toward her room he promised to search at once for alfred but georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from outside cast a weird glow through the window on the landinghe must be dead jameshe could never live sane and knowing what he did i heard him quarrelling with surama and know that awful things were going on he is my brother butit is best as it isher voice had sunk to a whispersuddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep hideous chuckle and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till they half resembled some nameless cyclopean creatures of nightmare james and georgina paused hesitant and peered out breathlessly through the landing window then from the sky came a thunderous peal as a forked bolt of lightning shot down with terrible directness into the very midst of the blazing ruin the deep chuckle ceased and in its place came a frantic ululant yelp as of a thousand ghouls and werewolves in torment it died away with long reverberant echoes and slowly the flames resumed their normal shapethe watchers did not move but waited till the pillar of fire had shrunk to a smouldering glow they were glad of a halfrusticity which had kept the firemen from trooping out and of the wall that excluded the curious what had happened was not for vulgar eyesit involved too much of the universes inner secrets for thatin the pale dawn james spoke softly to georgina who could do no more than put her head on his breast and sobsweetheart i think he has atoned he must have set the fire you know while i was asleep he told me it ought to be burnedthe clinic and everything in it surama too it was the only way to save the world from the unknown horrors he had loosed upon it he knew and he did what was besthe was a great man georgie lets never forget that we must always be proud of him for he started out to help mankind and was titanic even in his sins ill tell you more sometime what he did be it good or evil was what no man ever did before he was the first and last to break through certain veils and even apollonius of tyana takes second place beside him but we mustnt talk about that we must remember him only as the little alf we knewas the boy who wanted to master medicine and conquer feverin the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found two skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adheringonly two thanks to the undisturbed limepits one was of a man the other is still a subject of debate among the biologists of the coast it was not exactly an apes or a saurians skeleton but it had disturbing suggestions of lines of evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace the charred skull oddly enough was very human and reminded people of surama but the rest of the bones were beyond conjecture only wellcut clothing could have made such a body look like a manbut the human bones were clarendons no one disputed this and the world at large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor of his age the bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have far eclipsed dr millers kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to perfection much of millers late success indeed is credited to the notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames of the old rivalry and hatred almost none survived and even dr wilfred jones has been known to boast of his association with the vanished leaderjames dalton and his wife georgina have always preserved a reticence which modesty and family grief might well account for they published certain notes as a tribute to the great mans memory but have never confirmed or contradicted either the popular estimate or the rare hints of marvels that a very few keen thinkers have been known to whisper it was very subtly and slowly that the facts filtered out dalton probably gave dr macneil an inkling of the truth and that good soul had not many secrets from his sonthe daltons have led on the whole a very happy life for their cloud of terror lies far in the background and a strong mutual love has kept the world fresh for them but there are things which disturb them oddlylittle things of which one would scarcely ever think of complaining they cannot bear persons who are lean or deepvoiced beyond certain limits and georgina turns pale at the sound of any guttural chuckling senator dalton has a mixed horror of occultism travel hypodermics and strange alphabets which most find hard to unify and there are still those who blame him for the vast proportion of the doctors library that he destroyed with such painstaking completenessmacneil though seemed to realise he was a simple man and he said a prayer as the last of alfred clarendons strange books crumbled to ashes nor would anyone who had peered understandingly within those books wish a word of that prayer unsaid,1
