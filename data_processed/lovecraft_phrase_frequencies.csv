high up crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the old chateau of my ancestors for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the mossgrown castle walls these ancient turrets stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time formed in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all france from its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements barons counts and even kings had been defied yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invaderbut since those glorious years all is changed a poverty but little above the level of dire want together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour and the falling stones of the walls the overgrown vegetation in the parks the dry and dusty moat the illpaved courtyards and toppling towers without as well as the sagging floors the wormeaten wainscots and the faded tapestries within all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur as the ages passed first one then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estateit was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that i antoine last of the unhappy and accursed comtes de c first saw the light of day ninety long years ago within these walls and amongst the dark and shadowy forests the wild ravines and grottoes of the hillside below were spent the first years of my troubled life my parents i never knew my father had been killed at the age of thirtytwo a month before i was born by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle and my mother having died at my birth my care and education devolved solely upon one remaining servitor an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence whose name i remember as pierre i was an only child and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill at the time pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company now i know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearthsthus isolated and thrown upon my own resources i spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadowhaunted library of the chateau and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot it was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attentionof my own race i was permitted to learn singularly little yet what small knowledge of it i was able to gain seemed to depress me much perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which i ever felt at the mention of my great house yet as i grew out of childhood i was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which i had always deemed strange but which now became dimly terrible the circumstance to which i allude is the early age at which all the comtes of my line had met their end whilst i had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of shortlived men i afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirtytwo years upon my twentyfirst birthday the aged pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son and continued by each possessor its contents were of the most startling nature and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions at this time my belief in the supernatural was firm and deepseated else i should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyesthe paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century when the old castle in which i sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress it told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our estates a person of no small accomplishments though little above the rank of peasant by name michel usually designated by the surname of mauvais the evil on account of his sinister reputation he had studied beyond the custom of his kind seeking such things as the philosophers stone or the elixir of eternal life and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy michel mauvais had one son named charles a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts and who had therefore been called le sorcier or the wizard this pair shunned by all honest folk were suspected of the most hideous practices old michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the devil and the unaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray of humanity the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affectionone night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young godfrey son to henri the comte a searching party headed by the frantic father invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old michel mauvais busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron without certain cause in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair the comte laid hands on the aged wizard and ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no more meanwhile joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain as the comte and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists the form of charles le sorcier appeared through the trees the excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred yet he seemed at first unmoved at his fathers fate then slowly advancing to meet the comte he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of cmay neer a noble of thy murdrous linesurvive to reach a greater age than thinespake he when suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his fathers slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night the comte died without utterance and was buried the next day but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth no trace of the assassin could be found though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighbouring woods and the meadowland around the hillthus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the minds of the late comtes family so that when godfrey innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title was killed by an arrow whilst hunting at the age of thirtytwo there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise but when years afterward the next young comte robert by name was found dead in a nearby field from no apparent cause the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his thirtysecond birthday when surprised by early death louis son to robert was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle henris roberts antoines and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murderthat i had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which i read my life previously held at small value now became dearer to me each day as i delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic isolated as i was modern science had produced no impression upon me and i laboured as in the middle ages as wrapt as had been old michel and young charles themselves in the acquisition of daemonological and alchemical learning yet read as i might in no manner could i account for the strange curse upon my line in unusually rational moments i would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister charles le sorcier and his heirs yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist i would fall back to occult studies and once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house from its terrible burden upon one thing i was absolutely resolved i should never wed for since no other branches of my family were in existence i might thus end the curse with myselfas i drew near the age of thirty old pierre was called to the land beyond alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau which in youth fear had caused me to shun and some of which old pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries strange and awesome were many of the objects i encountered furniture covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness met my eyes cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloomof my exact age even down to days and hours i kept a most careful record for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence at length i approached that time which i had so long viewed with apprehension since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of comte henri at his end i was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death in what strange form the curse should overtake me i knew not but i was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contentsit was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle less than a week before that fatal hour which i felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth beyond which i could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that i came upon the culminating event of my whole life i had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down halfruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets as the afternoon progressed i sought the lower levels descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder as i slowly traversed the nitreencrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase the paving became very damp and soon i saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank waterstained wall impeded my journey turning to retrace my steps my eye fell upon a small trapdoor with a ring which lay directly beneath my feet pausing i succeeded with difficulty in raising it whereupon there was revealed a black aperture exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps as soon as the torch which i lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and steadily i commenced my descent the steps were many and led to a narrow stoneflagged passage which i knew must be far underground the passage proved of great length and terminated in a massive oaken door dripping with the moisture of the place and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction i had proceeded back some distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind without warningi heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hingesmy immediate sensations are incapable of analysis to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as i had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description when at last i turned and faced the seat of the sound my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld there in the ancient gothic doorway stood a human figure it was that of a man clad in a skullcap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour his long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue and of incredible profusion his forehead high beyond the usual dimensions his cheeks deepsunken and heavily lined with wrinkles and his hands long clawlike and gnarled were of such a deathly marblelike whiteness as i have never elsewhere seen in man his figure lean to the proportions of a skeleton was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment but strangest of all were his eyes twin caves of abysmal blackness profound in expression of understanding yet inhuman in degree of wickedness these were now fixed upon me piercing my soul with their hatred and rooting me to the spot whereon i stood at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence the language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of latin in use amongst the more learned men of the middle ages and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and daemonologists the apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house told me of my coming end dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old michel mauvais and gloated over the revenge of charles le sorcier he told how the young charles had escaped into the night returning in after years to kill godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his fathers at his assassination how he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself unknown in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator how he had seized robert son of godfrey in a field forced poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of thirtytwo thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards father and son speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youthhis enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them but suddenly the fiendish glare returned and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had charles le sorcier six hundred years before ended that of my ancestor prompted by some preserving instinct of selfdefence i broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance the shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the wouldbe assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves and i fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faintwhen at last my senses returned all was frightfully dark and my mind remembering what had occurred shrank from the idea of beholding more yet curiosity overmastered all who i asked myself was this man of evil and how came he within the castle walls why should he seek to avenge the death of poor michel mauvais and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of charles le sorcier the dread of years was lifted from my shoulders for i knew that he whom i had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse and now that i was free i burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries and made of my own youth one longcontinued nightmare determined upon further exploration i felt in my pockets for flint and steel and lit the unused torch which i had with me first of all the new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger the hideous eyes were now closed disliking the sight i turned away and entered the chamber beyond the gothic door here i found what seemed much like an alchemists laboratory in one corner was an immense pile of a shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch it may have been gold but i did not pause to examine it for i was strangely affected by that which i had undergone at the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest filled with wonder yet now realising how the man had obtained access to the chateau i proceeded to return i had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face but as i approached the body i seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound as though life were not yet wholly extinct aghast i turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor then all at once the horrible eyes blacker even than the seared face in which they were set opened wide with an expression which i was unable to interpret the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand once i caught the name of charles le sorcier and again i fancied that the words years and curse issued from the twisted mouth still i was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech at my evident ignorance of his meaning the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me until helpless as i saw my opponent to be i trembled as i watched himsuddenly the wretch animated with his last burst of strength raised his hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement then as i remained paralysed with fear he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my nights fool he shrieked can you not guess my secret have you no brain whereby you may recognise the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house have i not told you of the great elixir of eternal life know you not how the secret of alchemy was solved i tell you it is i ii that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revengefor i am charles le sorcier,1
hello bruce havent seen you in a dogs age come ini threw open the door and he followed me into the room his gaunt ungainly figure sprawled awkwardly into the chair i indicated and he twirled his hat between nervous fingers his deepset eyes wore a worried hunted look and he glanced furtively around the room as if searching for a hidden something which might unexpectedly pounce upon him his face was haggard and colorless the corners of his mouth twitched spasmodicallywhats the matter old man you look as if youd seen a ghost brace up i crossed to the buffet and poured a small glass of wine from the decanter drink thishe downed it with a hasty gulp and took to toying with his hat againthanks praguei dont feel quite myself tonightyou dont look it either whats wrongmalcolm bruce shifted uneasily in his chairi eyed him in silence for a moment wondering what could possibly affect the man so strongly i knew bruce as a man of steady nerves and iron will to find him so visibly upset was in itself unusual i passed cigars and he selected one automaticallyit was not until the second cigar had been lighted that bruce broke the silence his nervousness was apparently gone once more he was the dominant selfreliant figure i knew of oldprague he began ive just been through the most devilish gruesome experience that ever befell a man i dont know whether i dare tell it or not for fear youll think ive gone crazyand i wouldnt blame you if you did but its true every word of ithe paused dramatically and blew a few rings of smoke in the airi smiled many a weird tale i had listened to over that selfsame table there must have been some kink in my personality that inspired confidence for i had been told stories that some men would have given years of their life to have heard and yet despite my love of the bizarre and the dangerous and my longing to explore far reaches of littleknown lands i had been doomed to a life of prosaic flat uneventful businessdo you happen to have heard of professor van allister asked bruceyou dont mean arthur van allisterthe same then youknowhimi should say so known him for years ever since he resigned as professor of chemistry at the college so he could have more time for his experiments why i even helped him choose the plans for that soundproof laboratory of his on the top floor of his home then he got so busy with his confounded experiments he couldnt find time to be chummyyou may recall prague that when we were in college together i used to dabble quite a bit in chemistryi nodded and bruce continuedabout four months ago i found myself out of a job van allister advertised for an assistant and i answered he remembered me from college days and i managed to convince him i knew enough about chemistry to warrant a trialhe had a young lady doing his secretarial worka miss marjorie purdy she was one of these strictattentiontobusiness types and as goodlooking as she was efficient she had been helping van allister a bit in his laboratory and i soon discovered she took a genuine interest in puttering around making experiments of her own indeed she spent nearly all her spare time with us in the laboratoryit was only natural that such companionship should result in a close friendship and it wasnt long before i began to depend on her to help me in difficult experiments when the professor was busy i never could seem to stump her that girl took to chemistry as a duck takes to waterabout two months ago van allister had the laboratory partitioned off and made a separate workroom for himself he told us that he was about to enter upon a series of experiments which if successful would bring him everlasting fame he flatly refused to make us his confidants in any way shape or mannerfrom that time on miss purdy and i were left alone more and more for days at a time the professor would retire to the seclusion of his new workshop sometimes not even appearing for his mealsthat meant too that we had more spare time on our hands our friendship ripened i felt a growing admiration for the trim young woman who seemed perfectly content to fuss around smelly bottles and sticky messes gowned in white from head to foot even to the rubber gloves she woreday before yesterday van allister invited us into his workshopat last i have achieved success he announced holding up for our inspection a small bottle containing a colorless liquid i have here what will rank as the greatest chemical discovery ever known i am going to prove its efficacy right before your eyes bruce will you bring me one of the rabbits pleasei went back into the other room and brought him one of the rabbits we kept together with guinea pigs for experimental purposeshe put the little animal into a small glass box just large enough to hold it and closed the cover then he set a glass funnel in a hole in the top of the box and we drew nearer to watch the experimenthe uncorked the bottle and poised it above the rabbits prisonnow to prove whether my weeks of effort have resulted in success or failureslowly methodically he emptied the contents of the bottle into the funnel and we watched it trickle into the compartment with the frightened animalmiss purdy uttered a suppressed cry and i rubbed my eyes to make sure that they had not deceived me for in the case where but a moment before there had been a live terrified rabbitthere was now nothing but a pile of soft white ashesprofessor van allister turned to us with an air of supreme satisfaction his face radiated ghoulish glee and his eyes were alight with a weird insane gleam when he spoke his voice took on a tone of masterybruceand you too miss purdyit has been your privilege to witness the first successful trial of a preparation that will revolutionize the world it will instantaneously reduce to a fine ash anything with which it comes into contact except glass just think what that means an army equipped with glass bombs filled with my compound could annihilate the world wood metal stone brickeverythingswept away before them leaving no more trace than the rabbit i have just experimented uponjust a pile of soft white ashesi glanced at miss purdy her face had gone as white as the apron she worewe watched van allister as he transferred all that was left of the bunny to a small bottle and neatly labeled it ill admit that i was suffering a mental chill myself by the time he dismissed me and we left him alone behind the tightly closed doors of his workshoponce safely outside miss purdys nerves gave way completely she reeled and would have fallen had i not caught her in my armsthe feel of her soft yielding body held close to my own was the last straw i cast prudence to the winds and crushed her tightly to my breast kiss after kiss i pressed upon her full red lips until her eyes opened and i saw the lovelight reflected in themafter a delicious eternity we came back to earth againlong enough to realize that the laboratory was no place for such ardent demonstrations at any moment van allister might come out of his retreat and if he should discover our lovemakingin his present state of mindwe dared not think of what might happenfor the rest of the day i was like a man in a dream its a wonder to me that i succeeded in accomplishing anything at all my body was merely an automaton a welltrained machine going about its appointed tasks while my mind soared into faraway realms of delightful daydreamingmarjorie kept busy with her secretarial work for the rest of the day and not once did i lay eyes upon her until my tasks in the laboratory were completedthat night we gave over to the joys of our newfound happiness prague i shall remember that night as long as i live the happiest moment i have ever known was when marjorie purdy promised to become my wifeyesterday was another day of unalloyed bliss all day long my sweetheart and i worked side by side then followed another night of lovemaking if youve never been in love with the only girl in the world prague you cant understand the delirious joy that comes from the very thought of her and marjorie returned my devotion a hundredfold she gave herself unreservedly into my keepingalong about noontime today i needed something to complete an experiment and i stepped over to the drug store for itwhen i returned i missed marjorie i looked for her hat and coat and they were gone the professor had not shown himself since the experiment upon the rabbit and was locked in his workshopi asked the servants but none of them had seen her leave the house nor had she left any message for meas the afternoon wore on i grew frantic evening came and still no sign of my dear little girlall thought of work was forgotten i paced the floor of my room like a caged lion every jangle of the phone or ring at the door bolstered up my faltering hopes of some word from her but each time i was doomed to disappointment each minute seemed an hour each hour an eternitygood god prague you cant imagine how i suffered from the heights of sublime love i mentally plunged to the darkest depths of despair i conjured visions of all sorts of terrible fates overtaking her still not a word did i hearit seemed to me that i had lived a lifetime but my watch told me it was only halfpast seven when the butler told me that van allister wanted me in the laboratoryi was in no mood for experiments but while i was under his roof he was my master and it was for me to obeythe professor was in his workshop the door slightly ajar he called to me to close the door of the laboratory and join him in the little roomin my present state of mind my brain photographed every minute detail of the scene which met my eyes in the center of the room on a marbletop table was a glass case about the shape and size of a coffin it was filled almost to the brim with that same colorless liquid which the small bottle had contained two days beforeat the left on a glasstop tabourette was a newly labeled glass jar i could not repress an involuntary shudder as i realized that it was filled with soft white ashes then i saw something that almost made my heart stop beatingon a chair in a far corner of the workshop was the hat and coat of the girl who had pledged her life to minethe girl whom i had vowed to cherish and protect while life should lastmy senses were numbed my soul surcharged with horror as realization flashed over me there could be but one explanationthe ashes in that jar were the ashes of marjorie purdythe world stood still for one long terrible moment and then i went madstark staring madthe next i can remember the professor and i were locked in a desperate struggle old as he was he still possessed a strength nearly equal to mine and he had the added advantage of calm selfpossessioncloser and closer he forced me to the glass coffin a few moments more and my ashes would join those of the girl i had loved i stumbled against the tabourette and my fingers closed over the jar of ashes with one last superhuman effort i raised it high above my head and brought it down with crushing force upon the skull of my antagonist his arm relaxed his limp form dropped in a senseless heap to the floorstill acting upon impulse i raised the silent form of the professor and carefully lest i should spill some of it on the floor lowered the body into the casket of deatha moment and it was over professor and liquid both were gone and in their place was a little pile of soft white ashesas i gazed at my handiwork the brainstorm passed away and i came face to face with the cold hard truth that i had killed a fellowbeing an unnatural calm possessed me i knew that there was not a single shred of evidence against me barring the fact that i was the last one known to be alone with the professor nothing remained but ashesi put on my hat and coat told the butler that the professor had left word he was not to be disturbed and that i was going out for the evening once outside all my selfpossession vanished my nerves were shot to pieces i dont know where i wentonly that i wandered aimlessly here and there until i found myself outside your apartment just a little while agoprague i felt as if i must talk with someone that i must unburden my tortured mind i knew that i could trust you old pal so ive told you the whole story here i amdo with me as you will life holds nothing more for me now thatmarjorieis gonebruces voice trembled with emotion and broke as he mentioned the name of the girl he lovedi leaned across the table and gazed searchingly into the eyes of the abject figure that slouched dejectedly in the big chair then i rose put on my hat and coat crossed to bruce who had buried his head in his hands and was shaking with silent sobsbrucemalcolm bruce raised his eyesbruce listen to meare you sure marjorie purdy is deadam i sure that his eyes widened at the suggestion and he sat erect with a sudden startexactly i went on are you positive that the ashes in that jar were the ashes of marjorie purdywhyisee here prague what are you driving atthen yourenotsure you saw the girls hat and coat in that chair and in your state of mind you jumped at conclusions the ashes must be those of the missing girl the professor must have made away with her and all that come now did van allistertellyou anythingi dont know what he said i tell you i wentberserkmadthen you come along with me if shes not dead she must be somewhere in that house and if sheisthere were going to find heron the street we hailed a taxi and in a few moments the butler admitted us to van allisters home bruce let us into the laboratory with his key the door of the workshop was still ajarmy eyes swept the room in a comprehensive survey at the left over near the window was a closed door i strode across the room and tried the knob but it refused to yieldwhere does that leadjust an anteroom where the professor keeps his apparatusall the same that doors coming open i returned grimly stepping back a pace or two i planted a welldirected kick upon the door another and still another and the framework around the lock gave waybruce with an inarticulate cry sped across the room to a huge mahogany chest he selected one of the keys on his ring inserted it in the lock and flung back the cover with trembling handshere she is praguequick get her out where theres airtogether we bore the limp figure of the girl into the laboratory bruce hastily mixed a concoction which he forced between her lips a second dose and her eyes slowly openedher bewildered glance traveled around the room at last resting on bruce and her eyes lighted with sudden happy recognition later after the first few moments of reunion the girl told us her storyafter malcolm went out this afternoon the professor sent word to me to come into the workshop as he often summoned me to do some errand or other i thought nothing of it and to save time took my hat and coat along he closed the door of the little room and without warning attacked me from behind he overpowered me tied me hand and foot it was needless to gag me as you know the laboratory is absolutely soundproofthen he produced a huge newfoundland dog he had secured from somewhere or other reduced it to ashes before my very eyes and put the ashes in a glass jar that was on a tabourette in the workshophe went into the anteroom and from the chest where you found me took out the glass casket at least it seemed a casket to my terrorstricken eyes he mixed enough of his horrible liquid to fill it almost to the brimthen he told me that but one thing remained that wasto perform the experiment upon a human being she shuddered at the recollection he dilated at length upon what a privilege it would be for anyone to sacrifice his life in such a manner for such a cause then he calmly informed me that he had selected you as the subject of his experiment and that i was to play the role of witness i faintedthe professor must have feared some sort of intrusion for the next i remember is waking inside the chest where you discovered me it was stifling every breath i took came harder and harder i thought of you malcolmthought of the wonderful happy hours we had spent together the last few days i wondered what i would do when you were gone i even prayed that he would kill me too my throat grew parched and dryeverything went black before my eyesnext i opened them to find myself herewith you malcolm her voice sank to a hoarse nervous whisper wherewhere is the professorbruce silently led her into the workshop she shivered as the coffin of glass came within her range of vision still silently he crossed directly to the casket and taking up a handful of the soft white ashes let them sift slowly through his fingers,1
ii am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why it is altogether against my will that i tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarcticwith its vast fossilhunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient icecapand i am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain doubt of the real facts as i must reveal them is inevitable yet if i suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left the hitherto withheld photographs both ordinary and arial will count in my favour for they are damnably vivid and graphic still they will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried the ink drawings of course will be jeered at as obvious impostures notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle overin the end i must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have on the one hand sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling mythcycles and on the other hand sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and overambitious programme in the region of those mountains of madness it is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates connected only with a small university have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly controversial nature are concernedit is further against us that we are not in the strictest sense specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned as a geologist my object in leading the miskatonic university expedition was wholly that of securing deeplevel specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent aided by the remarkable drill devised by prof frank h pabodie of our engineering department i had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this but i did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection pabodies drilling apparatus as the public already knows from our reports was unique and radical in its lightness portability and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness steel head jointed rods gasoline

especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added fuelwarming and quickstarting devices worked out by pabodie could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve uswe planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic seasonor longer if absolutely necessarywould permit operating mostly in the mountainranges and on the plateau south of ross sea regions explored in varying degree by shackleton amundsen scott and byrd with frequent changes of camp made by aroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material especially in the precambrian strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously been secured we wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks since the primal lifehistory of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earths past that the antarctic continent was once temperate and even tropical with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens marine fauna arachnida and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals is a matter of common information and we hoped to expand that information in variety accuracy and detail when a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs we would enlarge the aperture by blasting in order to get specimens of suitable size and conditionour borings of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock were to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfacesthese inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or twomile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels we could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of mere glaciation though pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasolinedriven dynamo it is this planwhich we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as oursthat the coming starkweathermoore expedition proposes to follow despite the warnings i have issued since our return from the antarcticthe public knows of the miskatonic expedition through our frequent wireless reports to thearkham advertiserand associated press and through the later articles of pabodie and myself we consisted of four men from the universitypabodie lake of the biology department atwood of the physics department also a meteorologist and i representing geology and having nominal commandbesides sixteen assistants seven graduate students from miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics of these sixteen twelve were qualified aroplane pilots all but two of whom were competent wireless operators eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant as did pabodie atwood and i in addition of course our two shipswooden exwhalers reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary steamwere fully manned the nathaniel derby pickman foundation aided by a few special contributions financed the expedition hence our preparations were extremely thorough despite the absence of great publicity the dogs sledges machines camp materials and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in boston and there our ships were loaded we were marvellously wellequipped for our specific purposes and in all matters pertaining to supplies regimen transportation and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors it was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expeditionample though it wasso little noticed by the world at largeas the newspapers told we sailed from boston harbour on september 2 1930 taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the panama canal and stopping at samoa and hobart tasmania at which latter place we took on final supplies none of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before hence we all relied greatly on our ship captainsj b douglas commanding the brigarkhamand serving as commander of the sea party and georg thorfinnssen commanding the barquemiskatonicboth veteran whalers in antarctic waters as we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in the north and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day at about 62 south latitude we sighted our first icebergstablelike objects with vertical sidesand just before reaching the antarctic circle which we crossed on october 20 with appropriately quaint ceremonies we were considerably troubled with field ice the falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics but i tried to brace up for the worse rigours to come on many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly these including a strikingly vivid miragethe first i had ever seenin which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castlespushing through the ice which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed we regained open water at south latitude 67 east longitude 175 on the morning of october 26 a strong land blink appeared on the south and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast lofty and snowclad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead at last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death these peaks were obviously the admiralty range discovered by ross and it would now be our task to round cape adare and sail down the east coast of victoria land to our contemplated base on the shore of mcmurdo sound at the foot of the volcano erebus in south latitude 77 9the last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancystirring great barren peaks of mystery looming up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizongrazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow bluish ice and water lanes and black bits of exposed granite slope through the desolate summits swept raging intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and halfsentient musical piping with notes extending over a wide range and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing asian paintings of nicholas roerich and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of leng which occur in the dreadednecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred i was rather sorry later on that i had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college libraryon the seventh of november sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost we passed franklin island and the next day descried the cones of mts erebus and terror on ross island ahead with the long line of the parry mountains beyond there now stretched off to the east the low white line of the great ice barrier rising perpendicularly to a height of 200 feet like the rocky cliffs of quebec and marking the end of southward navigation in the afternoon we entered mcmurdo sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking mt erebus the scoriac peak towered up some 12700 feet against the eastern sky like a japanese print of the sacred fujiyama while beyond it rose the white ghostlike height of mt terror 10900 feet in altitude and now extinct as a volcano puffs of smoke from erebus came intermittently and one of the graduate assistantsa brilliant young fellow named danforthpointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope remarking that this mountain discovered in 1840 had undoubtedly been the source of poes image when he wrote seven years later ofthe lavas that restlessly rolltheir sulphurous currents down yaanekin the ultimate climes of the polethat groan as they roll down mount yaanekin the realms of the boreal poledanforth was a great reader of bizarre material and had talked a good deal of poe i was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of poes only long storythe disturbing and enigmaticalarthur gordon pymon the barren shore and on the lofty ice barrier in the background myriads of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins while many fat seals were visible on the water swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting iceusing small boats we effected a difficult landing on ross island shortly after midnight on the morning of the 9th carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a breechesbuoy arrangement our sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and complex even though at this particular point the scott and shackleton expeditions had preceded us our camp on the frozen shore below the volcanos slope was only a provisional one headquarters being kept aboard thearkhamwe landed all our drilling apparatus dogs sledges tents provisions gasoline tanks experimental icemelting outfit cameras both ordinary and arial aroplane parts and other accessories including three small portable wireless outfits besides those in the planes capable of communicating with thearkhamslarge outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit the ships outfit communicating with the outside world was to convey press reports to thearkham advertiserspowerful wireless station on kingsport head mass we hoped to complete our work during a single antarctic summer but if this proved impossible we would winter on thearkhamsending themiskatonicnorth before the freezing of the ice for another summers suppliesi need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work of our ascent of mt erebus our successful mineral borings at several points on ross island and the singular speed with which pabodies apparatus accomplished them even through solid rock layers our provisional test of the small icemelting equipment our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies and our final assembling of five huge aroplanes at the camp atop the barrier the health of our land partytwenty men and 55 alaskan sledge dogswas remarkable though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms for the most part the thermometer varied between zero and 20 or 25 above and our experience with new england winters had accustomed us to rigours of this sort the barrier camp was semipermanent and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline provisions dynamite and other supplies only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from thearkhamin case all our exploring planes were lost later when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from 600 to 700 miles southward beyond beardmore glacier despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau we determined to dispense with intermediate bases taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiencywireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking fourhour nonstop flight of our squadron on november 21 over the lofty shelf ice with vast peaks rising on the west and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines wind troubled us only moderately and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered when the vast rise loomed ahead between latitudes 83 and 84 we knew we had reached beardmore glacier the largest valley glacier in the world and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coastline at last we were truly entering the white aeondead world of the ultimate south and even as we realised it we saw the peak of mt nansen in the eastern distance towering up to its height of almost 15000 feetthe successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in latitude 86 7 east longitude 174 23 and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short aroplane flights are matters of history as is the arduous and triumphant ascent of mt nansen by pabodie and two of the graduate studentsgedney and carrollon december 1315 we were some 8500 feet above sealevel and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens the precambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous with the great bulk of the continent to the west but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below south americawhich we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of ross and weddell seas though byrd has since disproved the hypothesisin certain of the sandstones dynamited and chiselled after boring revealed their nature we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragmentsnotably ferns seaweeds trilobites crinoids and such molluscs as lingulae and gasteropodsall of which seemed of real significance in connexion with the regions primordial history there was also a queer triangular striated marking about a foot in greatest diameter which lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deepblasted aperture these fragments came from a point to the westward near the queen alexandra range and lake as a biologist seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist i saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depressionon january 6 1931 lake pabodie danforth all six of the students four mechanics and i flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes being forced down once by a sudden high wind which fortunately did not develop into a typical storm this was as the papers have stated one of several observation flights during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold silver and scarlet land of dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun on cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the twoat length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying 500 miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh subbase at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division as we mistakenly conceived it geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison our health so far had remained excellent limejuice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs it was now midsummer and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by march and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west but we had escaped damage through the skill of atwood in devising rudimentary aroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks and reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncannythe outside world knew of course of our programme and was told also of lakes strange and dogged insistence on a westwardor rather northwestwardprospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base it seems he had pondered a great deal and with alarmingly radical daring over that triangular striated marking in the slate reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the weststretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged he was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky unknown and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a datecambrian if not actually precambrianas to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage these fragments with their odd marking must have been 500 million to a thousand million years oldiipopular imagination i judge responded actively to our wireless bulletins of lakes start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionising the entire sciences of biology and geology his preliminary sledging and boring journey of january 1118 with pabodie and five othersmarred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressureridges in the icehad brought up more and more of the archaean slate and even i was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum these markings however were of very primitive lifeforms involving no great paradox except that any lifeforms should occur in rock as definitely precambrian as this seemed to be hence i still failed to see the good sense of lakes demand for an interlude in our timesaving programmean interlude requiring the use of all four planes many men and the whole of the expeditions mechanical apparatus i did not in the end veto the plan though i decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite lakes plea for my geological advice while they were gone i would remain at the base with pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift in preparation for this transfer one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from mcmurdo sound but this could wait temporarily i kept with me one sledge and nine dogs since it is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeonlong deathlakes subexpedition into the unknown as everyone will recall sent out its own reports from the shortwave transmitters on the planes these being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by thearkhamat mcmurdo sound whence they were relayed to the outside world on wavelengths up to fifty metres the start was made january 22 at 4 am and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later when lake spoke of descending and starting a smallscale icemelting and bore at a point some 300 miles away from us six hours after that a second and very excited message told of the frantic beaverlike work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original puzzlementthree hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale and when i despatched a message of protest against further hazards lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking i saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny and that i could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expeditions success but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests and unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some 1500 miles to the halfknown halfsuspected coastline of queen mary and knox landsthen in about an hour and a half more came that doubly excited message from lakes moving plane which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish i had accompanied the party1005 pm on the wing after snowstorm have spied mountainrange ahead higher than any hitherto seen may equal himalayas allowing for height of plateau probable latitude 76 15 longitude 113 10 e reaches far as can see to right and left suspicion of two smoking cones all peaks black and bare of snow gale blowing off them impedes navigationafter that pabodie the men and i hung breathlessly over the receiver thought of this titanic mountain rampart 700 miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure and we rejoiced that our expedition if not ourselves personally had been its discoverers in half an hour lake called us againmoultons plane forced down on plateau in foothills but nobody hurt and perhaps can repair shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further moves if necessary but no more heavy plane travel needed just now mountains surpass anything in imagination am going up scouting in carrolls plane with all weight out you cant imagine anything like this highest peaks must go over 35000 feet everest out of the running atwood to work out height with theodolite while carroll and i go up probably wrong about cones for formations look stratified possibly precambrian slate with other strata mixed in queer skyline effectsregular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks whole thing marvellous in redgold light of low sun like land of mystery in a dream or gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder wish you were here to studythough it was technically sleepingtime not one of us listeners thought for a moment of retiring it must have been a good deal the same at mcmurdo sound where the supply cache and thearkhamwere also getting the messages for capt douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find and sherman the cache operator seconded his sentiments we were sorry of course about the damaged aroplane but hoped it could be easily mended then at 11 pm came another call from lakeup with carroll over highest foothills dont dare try really tall peaks in present weather but shall later frightful work climbing and hard going at this altitude but worth it great range fairly solid hence cant get any glimpses beyond main summits exceed himalayas and very queer range looks like precambrian slate with plain signs of many other upheaved strata was wrong about volcanism goes farther in either direction than we can see swept clear of snow above about 21000 feet odd formations on slopes of highest mountains great low square blocks with exactly vertical sides and rectangular lines of low vertical ramparts like the old asian castles clinging to steep mountains in roerichs paintings impressive from distance flew close to some and carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate pieces but that is probably weathering most edges crumbled and rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years parts especially upper parts seem to be of lightercoloured rock than any visible strata on slopes proper hence an evidently crystalline origin close flying shews many cavemouths some unusually regular in outline square or semicircular you must come and investigate think i saw rampart squarely on top of one peak height seems about 30000 to 35000 feet am up 21500 myself in devilish gnawing cold wind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves but no flying danger so farfrom then on for another halfhour lake kept up a running fire of comment and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on foot i replied that i would join him as soon as he could send a plane and that pabodie and i would work out the best gasoline planjust where and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expeditions altered character obviously lakes boring operations as well as his aroplane activities would need a great deal delivered for the new base which he was to establish at the foot of the mountains and it was possible that the eastward flight might not be made after all this season in connexion with this business i called capt douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the single dogteam we had left there a direct route across the unknown region between lake and mcmurdo sound was what we really ought to establishlake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where moultons plane had been forced down and where repairs had already progressed somewhat the icesheet was very thin with dark ground here and there visible and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions he spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene and the queer state of his sensations at being in the lee of vast silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the worlds rim atwoods theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from 30000 to 34000 feet the windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed lake for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales violent beyond anything we had so far encountered his camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher foothills abruptly rose i could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his wordsflashed across a glacial void of 700 milesas he urged that we all hasten with the matter and get the strange new region disposed of as soon as possible he was about to rest now after a continuous days work of almost unparalleled speed strenuousness and resultsin the morning i had a threecornered wireless talk with lake and capt douglas at their widely separated bases and it was agreed that one of lakes planes would come to my base for pabodie the five men and myself as well as for all the fuel it could carry the rest of the fuel question depending on our decision about an easterly trip could wait for a few days since lake had enough for immediate camp heat and borings eventually the old southern base ought to be restocked but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer and meanwhile lake must send a plane to explore a direct route between his new mountains and mcmurdo soundpabodie and i prepared to close our base for a short or long period as the case might be if we wintered in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from lakes base to thearkhamwithout returning to this spot some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow and now we decided to complete the job of making a permanent esquimau village owing to a very liberal tent supply lake had with him all that his base would need even after our arrival i wirelessed that pabodie and i would be ready for the northwestward move after one days work and one nights restour labours however were not very steady after 4 pm for about that time lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages his working day had started unpropitiously since an aroplane survey of the nearly exposed rock surfaces shewed an entire absence of those archaean and primordial strata for which he was looking and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that loomed up at a tantalising distance from the camp most of the rocks glimpsed were apparently jurassic and comanchian sandstones and permian and triassic schists with now and then a glossy black outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal this rather discouraged lake whose plans all hinged on unearthing specimens more than 500 million years older it was clear to him that in order to recover the archaean slate vein in which he had found the odd markings he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselveshe had resolved nevertheless to do some local boring as part of the expeditions general programme hence set up the drill and put five men to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aroplane the softest visible rocka sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camphad been chosen for the first sampling and the drill made excellent progress without much supplementary blasting it was about three hours afterward following the first really heavy blast of the operation that the shouting of the drill crew was heard and that young gedneythe acting foremanrushed into the camp with the startling newsthey had struck a cave early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of comanchian limestone full of minute fossil cephalopods corals echini and spirifera and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bonesthe latter probably of teliosts sharks and ganoids this in itself was important enough as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured but when shortly afterward the drillhead dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators a goodsized blast had laid open the subterrene secret and now through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet thick there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic worldthe hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh slightly moving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean system its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites some of which met in columnar form but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones which in places nearly choked the passage washed down from unknown jungles of mesozoic treeferns and fungi and forests of tertiary cycads fanpalms and primitive angiosperms this osseous medley contained representatives of more cretaceous eocene and other animal species than the greatest palaeontologist could have counted or classified in a year molluscs crustacean armour fishes amphibians reptiles birds and early mammalsgreat and small known and unknown no wonder gedney ran back to the camp shouting and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a newfound gateway to secrets of inner earth and vanished aeonswhen lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity he scribbled a message in his notebook and had young moulton run back to the camp to despatch it by wireless this was my first word of the discovery and it told of the identification of early shells bones of ganoids and placoderms remnants of labyrinthodonts and thecodonts great mososaur skull fragments dinosaur vertebrae and armourplates pterodactyl teeth and wingbones archaeopteryx debris miocene sharks teeth primitive birdskulls and skulls vertebrae and other bones of archaic mammals such as palaeotheres xiphodons dinocerases eohippi oreodons and titanotheres there was nothing as recent as a mastodon elephant true camel deer or bovine animal hence lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the oligocene age and that the hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried dead and inaccessible state for at least thirty million yearson the other hand the prevalence of very early lifeforms was singular in the highest degree though the limestone formation was on the evidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites positively and unmistakably comanchian and not a particle earlier the free fragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periodseven rudimentary fishes molluscs and corals as remote as the silurian or ordovician the inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of over 300 million years ago and that of only thirty million years ago how far this continuity had extended beyond the oligocene age when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation in any event the coming of the frightful ice in the pleistocene some 500000 years agoa mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavitymust have put an end to any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common termslake was not content to let his first message stand but had another bulletin written and despatched across the snow to the camp before moulton could get back after that moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes transmitting to meand to thearkhamfor relaying to the outside worldthe frequent postscripts which lake sent him by a succession of messengers those who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created among men of science by that afternoons reportsreports which have finally led after all these years to the organisation of that very starkweathermoore expedition which i am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes i had better give the messages literally as lake sent them and as our base operator mctighe translated them from his pencil shorthandfowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone fragments from blasts several distinct triangular striated prints like those in archaean slate proving that source survived from over 600 million years ago to comanchian times without more than moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size comanchian prints apparently more primitive or decadent if anything than older ones emphasise importance of discovery in press will mean to biology what einstein has meant to mathematics and physics joins up with my previous work and amplifies conclusions appears to indicate as i suspected that earth has seen whole cycle or cycles of organic life before known one that begins with archaeozoic cells was evolved and specialised not later than thousand million years ago when planet was young and recently uninhabitable for any

later job now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp without dogs which bark furiously and cant be trusted near them with nine menthree left to guard the dogswe ought to manage the three sledges fairly well though wind is bad must establish plane communication with mcmurdo sound and begin shipping material but ive got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest wish i had a real laboratory here dyer better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip first the worlds greatest mountains and then this if this last isnt the high spot of the expedition i dont know what is were made scientifically congrats pabodie on the drill that opened up the cave now willarkhamplease repeat descriptionthe sensations of pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description nor were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm mctighe who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the droning receiving set wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version as soon as lakes operator signed off all appreciated the epochmaking significance of the discovery and i sent lake congratulations as soon as thearkhamsoperator had repeated back the descriptive parts as requested and my example was followed by sherman from his station at the mcmurdo sound supply cache as well as by capt douglas of thearkhamlater as head of the expedition i added some remarks to be relayed through thearkhamto the outside world of course rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement and my only wish was to get to lakes camp as quickly as i could it disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early arial travel impossiblebut within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment lake was sending more messages and told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp it had been a hard pull for the things were surprisingly heavy but nine men had accomplished it very neatly now some of the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding the specimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp save for one on which lake was making crude attempts at dissectionthis dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected for despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen specimena powerful and intact onelost nothing of their more than leathery toughness lake was puzzled as to how he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the structural niceties he was looking for he had it is true seven more perfect specimens but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited supply accordingly he removed the specimen and dragged in one which though having remnants of the starfisharrangements at both ends was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrowsresults quickly reported over the wireless were baffling and provocative indeed nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered existing biology would have to be wholly revised for this thing was no product of any cellgrowth science knows about there had been scarcely any mineral replacement and despite an age of perhaps forty million years the internal organs were wholly intact the leathery undeteriorative and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the things form of organisation and pertained to some palaeogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation at first all that lake found was dry but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect organic moisture of pungent and offensive odour was encountered toward the things uninjured side it was not blood but a thick darkgreen fluid apparently answering the same purpose by the time lake reached this stage all 37 dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid diffusive smellfar from helping to place the strange entity this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery all guesses about its external members had been correct and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that lake was left hopelessly at sea it had digestion and circulation and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its starfishshaped base cursorily one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide and there were odd evidences of airstorage chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathingsystemsgills and pores clearly it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless hibernationperiods as well vocal organs seemed present in connexion with the main respiratory system but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution articulate speech in the sense of syllableutterance seemed barely conceivable but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable the muscular system was almost preternaturally developedthe nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave lake aghast though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects the thing had a set of ganglial centres and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialised development its fivelobed brain was surprisingly advanced and there were signs of a sensory equipment served in part through the wiry cilia of the head involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism probably it had more than five senses so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing analogy it must lake thought have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and delicately differentiated functions in its primal world much like the ants and bees of today it reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams especially the pteridophytes having sporecases at the tips of the wings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallusbut to give it a name at this stage was mere folly it looked like a radiate but was clearly something more it was partly vegetable but had threefourths of the essentials of animal structure that it was marine in origin its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its later adaptations the wings after all held a persistent suggestion of the arial how it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a newborn earth in time to leave prints in archaean rocks was so far beyond conception as to make lake whimsically recall the primal myths about great old ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earthlife as a joke or mistake and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by a folklorist colleague in miskatonics english departmentnaturally he considered the possibility of the precambrian prints having been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens but quickly rejected this too facile theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the older fossils if anything the later contours shewed decadence rather than higher evolution the size of the pseudofeet had decreased and the whole morphology seemed coarsened and simplified moreover the nerves and organs just examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more complex atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent altogether little could be said to have been solved and lake fell back on mythology for a provisional namejocosely dubbing his finds the elder onesat about 230 am having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin emerged from the laboratory tent and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest the ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle so that the headpoints and tubes of two or three shewed signs of unfolding but lake did not believe there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air he did however move all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays that would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs whose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters he had to weight down the corners of the tentcloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts early apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived and under atwoods supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents new dogcorral and crude aroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side these latter shelters begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments were by no means as high as they should have been and lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on themit was after four when lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher he held some friendly chat with pabodie over the ether and repeated his praise of the really marvellous drills that had helped him make his discovery atwood also sent greetings and praises i gave lake a warm word of congratulation owning up that he was right about the western trip and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning if the gale was then over lake would send a plane for the party at my base just before retiring i despatched a final message to thearkhamwith instructions about toning down the days news for the outside world since the full details seemed radical enough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiatediiinone of us i imagine slept very heavily or continuously that morning for both the excitement of lakes discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing so savage was the blast even where we were that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at lakes camp directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it mctighe was awake at ten oclock and tried to get lake on the wireless as agreed but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication we did however get thearkhamand douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach lake he had not known about the wind for very little was blowing at mcmurdo sound despite its persistent rage where we werethroughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get lake at intervals but invariably without results about noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded out of the west causing us to fear for the safety of our camp but it eventually died down with only a moderate relapse at 2 pm after three oclock it was very quiet and we redoubled our efforts to get lake reflecting that he had four planes each provided with an excellent shortwave outfit we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once nevertheless the stony silence continued and when we thought of the delirious force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the most direful conjecturesby six oclock our fears had become intense and definite and after a wireless consultation with douglas and thorfinnssen i resolved to take steps toward investigation the fifth aroplane which we had left at the mcmurdo sound supply cache with sherman and two sailors was in good shape and ready for instant use and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us i got sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible the air conditions being apparently highly favourable we then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party and decided that we would include all hands together with the sledge and dogs which i had kept with me even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our especial orders for heavy machinery transportation at intervals i still tried to reach lake with the wireless but all to no purposesherman with the sailors gunnarsson and larsen took off at 730 and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing they arrived at our base at midnight and all hands at once discussed the next move it was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a single aroplane without any line of bases but no one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity we turned in at two oclock for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane but were up again in four hours to finish the loading and packingat 715 am january 25th we started flying northwestward under mctighes pilotage with ten men seven dogs a sledge a fuel and food supply and other items including the planes wireless outfit the atmosphere was clear fairly quiet and relatively mild in temperature and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by lake as the site of his camp our apprehensions were over what we might find or fail to find at the end of our journey for silence continued to answer all calls despatched to the campevery incident of that fourandahalfhour flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial position in my life it marked my loss at the age of fiftyfour of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external nature and natures laws thenceforward the ten of usbut the student danforth and myself above all otherswere to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could the newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane telling of our nonstop course our two battles with treacherous upperair gales our glimpse of the broken surface where lake had sunk his midjourney shaft three days before and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snowcylinders noted by amundsen and byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau there came a point though when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand and a later point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorshipthe sailor larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles ahead and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane despite our speed they were very slow in gaining prominence hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off and visible only because of their abnormal height little by little however they rose grimly into the western sky allowing us to distinguish various bare bleak blackish summits and to catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent icedust clouds in the whole spectacle there was a persistent pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation as if these stark nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream and complex gulfs of remote time space and ultradimensionality i could not help feeling that they were evil thingsmountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss that seething halfluminous cloudbackground held ineffable suggestions of a vague etherealbeyondnessfar more than terrestrially spatial and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness separateness desolation and aeonlong death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral worldit was young danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skylineregularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes which lake had mentioned in his messages and which indeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial templeruins on cloudy asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by roerich there was indeed something hauntingly roerichlike about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery i had felt it in october when we first caught sight of victoria land and i felt it afresh now i felt too another wave of uneasy consciousness of archaean mythical resemblances of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of leng in the primal writings mythologists have placed leng in central asia but the racial memory of manor of his predecessorsis long and it may well be that certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than asia and earlier than any human world we know a few daring mystics have hinted at a prepleistocene origin for the fragmentary pnakotic manuscripts and have suggested that the devotees of tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as tsathoggua itself leng wherever in space or time it might brood was not a region i would care to be in or near nor did i relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and archaean monstrosities as those lake had just mentioned at the moment i felt sorry that i had ever read the abhorrednecronomiconor talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist wilmarth at the universitythis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills i had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism and i shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled icevapours above our headsthe effect was that of a cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination with vast aggregations of nightblack masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws and attaining the most grotesque extremes of sinister bizarrerie there were truncated cones sometimes terraced or fluted surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped discs and strange beetling tablelike constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or fivepointed stars with each one overlapping the one beneath there were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids and occasional needlelike spires in curious clusters of five all of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer giganticism the general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler scoresby in 1820 but at this time and place with those dark unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead that anomalous elderworld discovery in our minds and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portenti was glad when the mirage began to break up though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted temporary forms of even vaster hideousness as the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again and saw that our journeys end was not far off the unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a fieldglass we were over the lowest foothills now and could see amidst the snow ice and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be lakes camp and boring the higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than himalayan peaks beyond them at length ropesthe student who had relieved mctighe at the controlsbegan to head downward toward the lefthand dark spot whose size marked it as the camp as he did so mctighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expeditioneveryone of course has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day or of the night before that eleven known dead young gedney missing people pardoned our hazy lack of details through realisation of the shock the sad event must have caused us and believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside indeed i flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress utter bewilderment and soulclutching horror we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance the tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tellwhat i would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrorsit is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc whether all could have lived through it even without the other thing is gravely open to doubt the storm with its fury of madly driven iceparticles must have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before one aroplane shelterall it seems had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate statewas nearly pulverised and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces the exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking wooden surfaces left out in the blast were pitted and denuded of paint and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated it is also true that we found none of the archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole we did gather some minerals from a vast tumbled pile including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd fivepointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons and some fossil bones among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimensnone of the dogs survived their hurriedly built snow enclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed the wind may have done that though the greater breakage on the side next the camp which was not the windward one suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves all three sledges were gone and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown the drill and icemelting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which lake had blasted we likewise left at the camp the two most shakenup of the planes since our surviving party had only four real pilotssherman danforth mctighe and ropesin all with danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate we brought back all the books scientific equipment and other incidentals we could find though much was rather unaccountably blown away spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of conditionit was approximately 4 pm after wide plane cruising had forced us to give gedney up for lost that we sent our guarded message to thearkhamfor relaying and i think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing the most we said about agitation concerned our dogs whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor lakes accounts we did not mention i think their display of the same uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other objects in the disordered region objects including scientific instruments aroplanes and machinery both at the camp and at the boring whose parts had been loosened moved or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have harboured singular curiosity and investigativenessabout the fourteen biological specimens we were pardonably indefinite we said that the only ones we discovered were damaged but that enough was left of them to prove lakes description wholly and impressively accurate it was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this matterand we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find we had by that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of lakes men and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully buried upright in ninefoot snow graves under fivepointed mounds punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly like those on the queer greenish soapstones dug up from mesozoic or tertiary times the eight perfect specimens mentioned by lake seemed to have been completely blown awaywe were careful too about the publics general peace of mind hence danforth and i said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day it was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us on our return at 1 am danforth was close to hysterics but kept an admirably stiff upper lip it took no persuasion to make him promise not to shew our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside and to hide our camera films for private development later on so that part of my present story will be as new to pabodie mctighe ropes sherman and the rest as it will be to the world in general indeeddanforth is closer mouthed than i for he sawor thinks he sawone thing he will not tell even meas all know our report included a tale of a hard ascent a confirmation of lakes opinion that the great peaks are of archaean slate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle comanchian times a conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart formations a decision that the cavemouths indicate dissolved calcareous veins a conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers and a remark that the mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the mountains themselves20000 feet in elevation with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer precipices of the highest peaksthis body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes and it completely satisfied the men at the camp we laid our absence of sixteen hoursa longer time than our announced flying landing reconnoitring and rockcollecting programme called forto a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions and told truly of our landing on the farther foothills fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our flight had any tried to do that i would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop themand i do not know what danforth would have done while we were gone pabodie sherman ropes mctighe and williamson had worked like beavers over lakes two best planes fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanismwe decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base as soon as possible even though indirect that was the safest way to work toward mcmurdo sound for a straightline flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the aeondead continent would involve many additional hazards further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery and the doubts and horrors around uswhich we did not revealmade us wish only to escape from this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we couldas the public knows our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters all planes reached the old base on the evening of the next dayjanuary 27thafter a swift nonstop flight and on the 28th we made mcmurdo sound in two laps the one pause being very brief and occasioned by a faulty rudder in the furious wind over the iceshelf after we had cleared the great plateau in five days more thearkhamandmiskatonicwith all hands and equipment on board were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working up ross sea with the mocking mountains of victoria land looming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the winds wails into a wideranged musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted accursed realm where life and death space and time have made black and blasphemous alliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on the planets scarcecooled crustsince our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic exploration and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with splendid unity and faithfulness even young danforth with his nervous breakdown has not flinched or babbled to his doctorsindeed as i have said there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me though i think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so it might explain and relieve much though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock that is the impression i gather after those rare irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to methings which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself againit will be hard work deterring others from the great white south and some of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice we might have known from the first that human curiosity is undying and that the results we announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same agelong pursuit of the unknown lakes reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and palaeontologists to the highest pitch though we were sensible enough not to shew the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried specimens or our photographs of those specimens as they were found we also refrained from shewing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones while danforth and i have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across the range and the crumpled things we smoothed studied in terror and brought away in our pockets but now that starkweathermoore party is organising and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted if not dissuaded they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that which may end the world we know so i must break through all reticences at lasteven about that ultimate nameless thing beyond the mountains of madnessivit is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that i let my mind go back to lakes camp and what we really found thereand to that other thing beyond the frightful mountain wall i am constantly tempted to shirk the details and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions i hope i have said enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest the rest that is of the horror at the camp i have told of the windravaged terrain the damaged shelters the disarranged machinery the varied uneasinesses of our dogs the missing sledges and other items the deaths of men and dogs the absence of gedney and the six insanely buried biological specimens strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries from a world forty million years dead i do not recall whether i mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing we did not think much about that till laterindeed only danforth and i have thought of it at allthe principal things i have been keeping back relate to the bodies and to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos at the time i tried to keep the mens minds off those points for it was so much simplerso much more normalto lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of lakes party from the look of things that daemon mountain wind must have been enough to drive any man mad in the midst of this centre of all earthly mystery and desolationthe crowning abnormality of course was the condition of the bodiesmen and dogs alike they had all been in some terrible kind of conflict and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways death so far as we could judge had in each case come from strangulation or laceration the dogs had evidently started the trouble for the state of their illbuilt corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within it had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish archaean organisms but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain when left alone in that monstrous wind behind flimsy walls of insufficient height they must have stampededwhether from the wind itself or from some subtle increasing odour emitted by the nightmare specimens one could not say those specimens of course had been covered with a tentcloth yet the low antarctic sun had beat steadily upon that cloth and lake had mentioned that solar heat tended to make the strangely sound and tough tissues of the things relax and expand perhaps the wind had whipped the cloth from over them and jostled them about in such a way that their more pungent olfactory qualities became manifest despite their unbelievable antiquitybut whatever had happened it was hideous and revolting enough perhaps i had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at lastthough with a categorical statement of opinion based on the firsthand observations and most rigid deductions of both danforth and myself that the then missing gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found i have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled now i must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious coldblooded and inhuman fashion it was the same with dogs and men all the healthier fatter bodies quadrupedal or bipedal had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed as by a careful butcher and around them was a strange sprinkling of salttaken from the ravaged provisionchests on the planeswhich conjured up the most horrible associations the thing had occurred in one of the crude aroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory scattered bits of clothing roughly slashed from the human incisionsubjects hinted no clues it is useless to bring up the halfimpression of certain faint snowprints in one shielded corner of the ruined enclosurebecause that impression did not concern human prints at all but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks one had to be careful of ones imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madnessas i have indicated gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end when we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent which we entered after investigating the monstrous graves had something to reveal it was not as lake had left it for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table indeed we had already realised that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had foundthe one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful odourmust represent the collected sections of the entity which lake had tried to analyse on and around that laboratory table were strown other things and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog i shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the mans identity lakes anatomical instruments were missing but there were evidences of their careful cleansing the gasoline stove was also gone though around it we found a curious litter of matches we buried the human parts beside the other ten men and the canine parts with the other 35 dogs concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory table and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered near it we were much too bewildered to speculatethis formed the worst of the camp horror but other things were equally perplexing the disappearance of gedney the one dog the eight uninjured biological specimens the three sledges and certain instruments illustrated technical and scientific books writing materials electric torches and batteries food and fuel heating apparatus spare tents fur suits and the like was utterly beyond sane conjecture as were likewise the spatterfringed inkblots on certain pieces of paper and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the boring the dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery then too there was the upsetting of the larder the disappearance of certain staples and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places the profusion of scattered matches intact broken or spent formed another minor enigma as did the two or three tentcloths and fur suits which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations the maltreatment of the human and canine bodies and the crazy burial of the damaged archaean specimens were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness in view of just such an eventuality as the present one we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed starkweathermoore expeditionour first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open the row of insane graves with the fivepointed snow mounds we could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds with their clusters of grouped dots to poor lakes descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral pile we found the likeness very close indeed the whole general formation it must be made clear seemed abominably suggestive of the starfishhead of the archaean entities and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitised minds of lakes overwrought party our own first sight of the actual buried entities formed a horrible moment and sent the imaginations of pabodie and myself back to some of the shocking primal myths we had read and heard we all agreed that the mere sight and continued presence of the things must have coperated with the oppressive polar solitude and daemon mountain wind in driving lakes party madfor madnesscentring in gedney as the only possible surviving agentwas the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned though i will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have harboured wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely sherman pabodie and mctighe made an exhaustive aroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon sweeping the horizon with fieldglasses in quest of gedney and of the various missing things but nothing came to light the party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike without any diminution in height or essential structure on some of the peaks though the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer having doubly fantastic similitudes to roerichpainted asian hill ruins the distribution of cryptical cavemouths on the black snowdenuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be tracedin spite of all the prevailing horrors we were left with enough sheer scientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those mysterious mountains as our guarded messages stated we rested at midnight after our day of terror and bafflement but not without a tentative plan for one or more rangecrossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with arial camera and geologists outfit beginning the following morning it was decided that danforth and i try it first and we awaked at 7 am intending an early trip though heavy windsmentioned in our brief bulletin to the outside worlddelayed our start till nearly nine oclocki have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at campand relayed outsideafter our return sixteen hours later it is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in the hidden transmontane worldhints of the revelations which have finally driven danforth to a nervous collapse i wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks he alone saweven though it was probably a nervous delusionand which was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is but he is firm against that all i can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the windtortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which i shared this will form my last word if the plain signs of surviving elder horrors in what i disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the inner antarcticor at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and unhuman aeoncursed desolationthe responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immensurable evils will not be minedanforth and i studying the notes made by pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant had calculated that the lowest available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us within sight of camp and about 23000 or 24000 feet above sealevel for this point then we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery the camp itself on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau was some 12000 feet in altitude hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose for on account of visibility conditions we had to leave the cabin windows open we were dressed of course in our heaviest fursas we drew near the forbidding peaks dark and sinister above the line of crevasseriven snow and interstitial glaciers we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes and thought again of the strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich the ancient and windweathered rock strata fully verified all of lakes bulletins and proved that these hoary pinnacles had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earths historyperhaps over fifty million years how much higher they had once been it was futile to guess but everything about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavourable to change and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegrationbut it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes ramparts and cavemouths which fascinated and disturbed us most i studied them with a fieldglass and took arial photographs whilst danforth drove and at times relieved him at the controlsthough my aviation knowledge was purely an amateursin order to let him use the binoculars we could easily see that much of the material of the things was a lightish archaean quartzite unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor lake had scarcely hintedas he had said their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration many parts especially those closest to the slopes seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface the whole arrangement looked like the ruins of machu picchu in the andes or the primal foundationwalls of kish as dug up by the oxfordfield museum expedition in 1929 and both danforth and i obtained that occasional impression ofseparate cyclopean blockswhich lake had attributed to his flightcompanion carroll how to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me and i felt queerly humbled as a geologist igneous formations often have strange regularitieslike the famous giants causeway in irelandbut this stupendous range despite lakes original suspicion of smoking cones was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structurethe curious cavemouths near which the odd formations seemed most abundant presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline they were as lakes bulletin had said often approximately square or semicircular as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites outside those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular and danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrositieswe had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected as we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a scott a shackleton or an amundsen some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to windbared passes with unusual continuity and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exceptionour sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed the touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic associationa thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes even the winds burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cavemouths there was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressionswe were now after a slow ascent at a height of 23570 feet according to the aneroid and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us up here were only dark bare rock slopes and the start of roughribbed glaciersbut with those provocative cubes ramparts and echoing cavemouths to add a portent of the unnatural the fantastic and the dreamlike looking along the line of high peaks i thought i could see the one mentioned by poor lake with a rampart exactly on top it seemed to be halflost in a queer antarctic haze such a haze perhaps as had been responsible for lakes early notion of volcanism the pass loomed directly before us smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapours and lighted by the low polar sunthe sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazeda few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm danforth and i unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines exchanged eloquent glances and then having gained those last few feet we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earthvi think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe wonder terror and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond of course we must have had some natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment probably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the garden of the gods in colorado or the fantastically symmetrical windcarved rocks of the arizona desert perhaps we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness we must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless tempestscarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal regular and geometrically eurhythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest and in places obviously thinnerthe effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable for some fiendish violation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset here on a hellishly ancient tableland fully 20000 feet high and in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less than 500000 years ago there stretched nearly to the visions limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental selfdefence could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and artificial cause we had previously dismissed so far as serious thought was concerned any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin how could they be otherwise when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial deathyet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken for this cyclopean maze of squared curved and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge it was very clearly the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark objective and ineluctable reality that damnable portent had had a material basis after allthere had been some horizontal stratum of icedust in the upper air and this shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection of course the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated and had contained things which the real source did not contain yet now as we saw that real source we thought it even more hideous and menacing than its distant imageonly the incredible unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousandsperhaps millionsof years it had brooded there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland corona mundi roof of the world all sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle i thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic worldof the daemoniac plateau of leng of the migo or abominable snowmen of the himalayas of the pnakotic manuscripts with their prehuman implications of the cthulhu cult of thenecronomiconand of the hyperborean legends of formless tsathoggua and the worse than formless starspawn associated with that semientityfor boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning indeed as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through which we had come we had merely struck at random a limited part of something of incalculable extent the foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts these latter as well as the queer cavemouths were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the mountainsthe nameless stone labyrinth consisted for the most part of walls from 10 to 150 feet in iceclear height and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet it was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate schist and sandstoneblocks in many cases as large as 4 6 8 feetthough in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid uneven bedrock of precambrian slate the buildings were far from equal in size there being innumerable honeycombarrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate structures the general shape of these things tended to be conical pyramidal or terraced though there were many perfect cylinders perfect cubes clusters of cubes and other rectangular forms and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose fivepointed ground plan roughly suggested modern fortifications the builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of the arch and domes had probably existed in the citys heydaythe whole tangle was monstrously weathered and the glacial surface from which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the gigantic piles and noticed the icepreserved stone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances above the ground on the exposed walls we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed closer inspection revealed countless largish windows some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion many of the ruins of course were roofless and with uneven though windrounded upper edges whilst others of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and pitting with the fieldglass we could barely make out what seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bandsdecorations including those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now assumed a vastly larger significancein many places the buildings were totally ruined and the icesheet deeply riven from various geologic causes in other places the stonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation one broad swath extending from the plateaus interior to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed was wholly free from buildings and probably represented we concluded the course of some great river which in tertiary timesmillions of years agohad poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean abyss of the great barrier range certainly this was above all a region of caves gulfs and underground secrets beyond human penetrationlooking back to our sensations and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from aeons we had thought prehuman i can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did of course we knew that somethingchronology scientific theory or our own consciousnesswas woefully awry yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane observe many things quite minutely and take a careful series of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good stead in my case ingrained scientific habit may have helped for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this ageold secretto know what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place and what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a concentration of life could have hadfor this place could be no ordinary city it must have formed the primary nucleus and centre of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earths history whose outward ramifications recalled only dimly in the most obscure and distorted myths had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom here sprawled a palaeogean megalopolis compared with which the fabled atlantis and lemuria commoriom and uzuldaroum and olatho in the land of lomar are recent things of todaynot even of yesterday a megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as valusia rlyeh ib in the land of mnar and the nameless city of arabia deserta as we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associationseven weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the campthe planes fueltank in the interest of greater lightness had been only partly filled hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations even so however we covered an enormous extent of groundor rather airafter swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible there seemed to be no limit to the mountainrange or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills fifty miles of flight in each direction shewed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice there were though some highly absorbing diversifications such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinkingplace in the great range the headlands at the streams entrance had been boldly carved into cyclopean pylons and something about the ridgy barrelshaped designs stirred up oddly vague hateful and confusing semiremembrances in both danforth and mewe also came upon several starshaped open spaces evidently public squares and noted various undulations in the terrain where a sharp hill rose it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling stone edifice but there were at least two exceptions of these latter one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the wellknown snake tomb in the ancient valley of petraflying inland from the mountains we discovered that the city was not of infinite width even though its length along the foothills seemed endless after about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice the course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad depressed line while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the misthazed westso far we had made no landing yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable accordingly we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our navigable pass there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on foot though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landingplaces selecting that nearest to the pass since our next flight would be across the great range and back to camp we succeeded about 1230 pm in coming down on a smooth hard snowfield wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favourable takeoff later onit did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold for our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass hand camera light provisions voluminous notebooks and paper geologists hammer and chisel specimenbags coil of climbing rope and powerful electric torches with extra batteries this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing take ground pictures make drawings and topographical sketches and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope outcropping or mountain cave fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up place in a spare specimenbag and use on the ancient principle of hareandhounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate this had been brought in case we found some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual rockchipping method of trailblazingwalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously true we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years agobefore any known race of men could have existedwas none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual both danforth and i found ourselves bearing up very well and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot it took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic fivepointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet for this latter we headed and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered cyclopean blocks we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our speciesthis rampart shaped like a star and perhaps 300 feet from point to point was built of jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size averaging 6 8 feet in surface there was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface looking through these we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick that there were no partitions remaining within and that there were traces of banded carvings or basreliefs on the interior walls facts we had indeed guessed before when flying low over this rampart and others like it though lower parts must have originally existed all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this pointwe crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less icechoked and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully and studied its mortarless cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment we wished that pabodie were present for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built upthe halfmile walk downhill to the actual city with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background was something whose smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but danforth and me conceive such optical effects between us and the churning vapours of the west lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers its outr and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision it was a mirage in solid stone and were it not for the photographs i would still doubt that such a thing could be the general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all descriptioneven the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its infinite bizarrerie endless variety preternatural massiveness and utterly alien exoticism there were geometrical forms for which an euclid could scarcely find a namecones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion shafts with odd bulbous enlargements broken columns in curious groups and fivepointed or fiveridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness as we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the icesheet and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures at various heights of orderly streets there seemed to be none the only broad open swath being a mile to the left where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town into the mountainsour fieldglasses shewed the external horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures and dotgroups to be very prevalent and we could half imagine what the city must once have looked likeeven though most of the roofs and towertops had necessarily perished as a whole it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys all of them deep canyons and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges now outspread below us it loomed like a dreamphantasy against a westward mist through whose northern end the low reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was struggling to shine and when for a moment that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow the effect was subtly menacing in a way i can never hope to depict even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful malignity the last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there under the glaciation we believed there must be a flight of steps or its equivalentwhen at last we plunged into the labyrinthine town itself clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls our sensations again became such that i marvel at the amount of selfcontrol we retained danforth was frankly jumpy and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the campwhich i resented all the more because i could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare antiquity the speculations worked on his imagination too for in one placewhere a debrislittered alley turned a sharp cornerhe insisted that he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle imaginary sound from some undefined pointa muffled musical piping he said not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves yet somehow disturbingly different the ceaselessfivepointednessof the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed placenevertheless our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead and we mechanically carried out our programme of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented in the masonry we wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place nothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the jurassic and comanchian periods nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than the pliocene age in stark certainty we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least 500000 years and in all probability even longeras we proceeded through this maze of stoneshadowed twilight we stopped at all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities some were above our reach whilst others led only into icechoked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill one though spacious and inviting opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of descent now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a surviving shutter and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain these things had come from mesozoic gymnosperms and conifersespecially cretaceous cycadsand from fanpalms and early angiosperms of plainly tertiary date nothing definitely later than the pliocene could be discovered in the placing of these shutterswhose edges shewed the former presence of queer and longvanished hingesusage seemed to be varied some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures they seemed to have become wedged in place thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and fasteningsafter a time we came across a row of windowsin the bulges of a colossal fiveridged cone of undamaged apexwhich led into a vast wellpreserved room with stone flooring but these were too high in the room to permit of descent without a rope we had a rope with us but did not wish to bother with this twentyfoot drop unless obliged toespecially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action this enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort and our electric torches shewed bold distinct and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques we took careful note of this spot planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encounteredfinally though we did encounter exactly the opening we wished an archway about six feet wide and ten feet high marking the former end of an arial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation these archways of course were flush with upperstory floors and in this case one of the floors still existed the building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left facing westward that across the alley where the other archway yawned was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture it was totally dark inside and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptinessheaped debris made the entrance to the vast lefthand building doubly easy yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the longwished chance for though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us in the end however we made the plunge and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure the floor beyond was of great slate slabs and seemed to form the outlet of a long high corridor with sculptured wallsobserving the many inner archways which led off from it and realising the probable complexity of the nest of apartments within we decided that we must begin our system of hareandhound trailblazing hitherto our compasses together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountainrange between the towers in our rear had been enough to prevent our losing our way but from now on the artificial substitute would be necessary accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size placed these in a bag to be carried by danforth and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow this method would probably gain us immunity from straying since there did not appear to be any strong aircurrents inside the primordial masonry if such should develop or if our paper supply should give out we could of course fall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method of rockchippingjust how extensive a territory we had opened up it was impossible to guess without a trial the close and frequent connexion of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallise the lower part for all succeeding time indeed one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim bygone aeon rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay had the coming of the ice been foreseen and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode the precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the icesheet at this point would have to wait for later solution it had not very plainly been a grinding drive perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible and perhaps some flood from the river or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range had helped to create the special state now observable imagination could conceive almost anything in connexion with this placeviit would be cumbrous to give a detailed consecutive account of our wanderings inside that cavernous aeondead honeycomb of primal masonry that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time after uncounted epochs to the tread of human feet this is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings our flashlight photographs of those carvings will do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing and it is lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us as it was we made crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used upthe building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past the inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls but on the lower levels were excellently preserved labyrinthine complexity involving curiously irregular differences in floor levels characterised the entire arrangement and we should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us we decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some 100 feet to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky ascent was effected over the steep transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs the rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions ranging from fivepointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes it might be safe to say that their general average was about 30 30 feet in floor area and 20 feet in height though many larger apartments existed after thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level we descended story by story into the submerged part where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building the cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became curiously oppressive and there was something vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours dimensions proportions decorations and constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework we soon realised from what the carvings revealed that this monstrous city was many million years oldwe cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses though the function of the arch was clearly much relied on the rooms we visited were wholly bare of all portable contents a circumstance which sustained our belief in the citys deliberate desertion the prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques there were exceptions to this rule of arrangement but its preponderance was overwhelming often however a series of smooth cartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bandsthe technique we soon saw was mature accomplished and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilised mastery though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race in delicacy of execution no sculpture i have ever seen could approach it the minutest details of elaborate vegetation or of animal life were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skilful intricacy the arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five the pictorial bands followed a highly formalised tradition and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the crosssection with the twodimensional silhouette and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity it is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futuriststhe arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines whose depth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches when cartouches with dotgroups appearedevidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial language and alphabetthe depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half and of the dots perhaps a halfinch more the pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface in some specimens marks of a former colouration could be detected though for the most part the untold aeons had disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied the more one studied the marvellous technique the more one admired the things beneath their strict conventionalisation one could grasp the minute and accurate observation and graphic skill of the artists and indeed the very conventions themselves served to symbolise and accentuate the real essence or vital differentiation of every object delineated we felt too that besides these recognisable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli which another mental and emotional background and a fuller or different sensory equipment might have made of profound and poignant significance to usthe subjectmatter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished epoch of their creation and contained a large proportion of evident history it is this abnormal historicmindedness of the primal racea chance circumstance operating through coincidence miraculously in our favourwhich made the carvings so awesomely informative to us and which caused us to place their photography and transcription above all other considerations in certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps astronomical charts and other scientific designs on an enlarged scalethese things giving a naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes and dadoes in hinting at what the whole revealed i can only hope that my account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those who believe me at all it would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage theminterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelvefoot doorways both now and then retaining the petrified wooden plankselaborately carved and polishedof the actual shutters and doors all metal fixtures had long ago vanished but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room windowframes with odd transparent panesmostly ellipticalsurvived here and there though in no considerable quantity there were also frequent niches of great magnitude generally empty but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilitiesheating lighting and the likeof a sort suggested in many of the carvings ceilings tended to be plain but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles mostly fallen now floors were also paved with such tiles though plain stonework predominatedas i have said all furniture and other moveables were absent but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomblike echoing rooms above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus litter and debris but farther down this condition decreased in some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness of course where rifts or collapses had occurred the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones a central courtas in other structures we had seen from the airsaved the inner regions from total darkness so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details below the icecap however the twilight deepened and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blacknessto form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeonsilent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods memories and impressions the sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us the moment we came upon a perfect section of carving where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist it took only a brief study to give us the hideous trutha truth which it would be naive to claim danforth and i had not independently suspected before though we had carefully refrained from even hinting it to each other there could now be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years ago when mans ancestors were primitive archaic mammals and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of europe and asiawe had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insistedeach to himselfthat the omnipresence of the fivepointed motif meant only some cultural or religious exaltation of the archaean natural object which had so patently embodied the quality of fivepointedness as the decorative motifs of minoan crete exalted the sacred bull those of egypt the scarabaeus those of rome the wolf and the eagle and those of various savage tribes some chosen totemanimal but this lone refuge was now stripped from us and we were forced to face definitely the reasonshaking realisation which the reader of these pages has doubtless long ago anticipated i can scarcely bear to write it down in black and white even now but perhaps that will not be necessarythe things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs but far worse mere dinosaurs were new and almost brainless objectsbut the builders of the city were wise and old and had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down wellnigh a thousand million years rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of cells rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all they were the makers and enslavers of that life and above all doubt the originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the pnakotic manuscripts and thenecronomiconaffrightedly hint about they were the great old ones that had filtered down from the stars when earth was youngthe beings whose substance an alien evolution had shaped and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred and to think that only the day before danforth and i had actually looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilised substance and that poor lake and his party had seen their complete outlines it is of course impossible for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of prehuman life after the first shock of the certain revelation we had to pause a while to recuperate and it was fully three oclock before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research the sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late dateperhaps two million years agoas checked up by geological biological and astronomical features and embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet one edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly even fifty million yearsto the lower eocene or upper cretaceousand contained basreliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else with one tremendous exception that we encountered that was we have since agreed the oldest domestic structure we traversedwere it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public i would refrain from telling what i found and inferred lest i be confined as a madman of course the infinitely early parts of the patchwork talerepresenting the preterrestrial life of the starheaded beings on other planets and in other galaxies and in other universescan readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings themselves yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics that i scarcely know what to think let others judge when they see the photographs i shall publishnaturally no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction of any connected story nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages of that story in their proper order some of the vast rooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned whilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors the best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the ancient ground levela cavern perhaps 200 feet square and sixty feet high which had almost undoubtedly been an educational centre of some sort there were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms and buildings since certain chapters of experience and certain summaries or phases of racial history had evidently been favourites with different decorators or dwellers sometimes though variant versions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points and filling in gapsi still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal of course we even now have only the barest outline and much of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made it may be the effect of this later studythe revived memories and vague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed horrorglimpse whose essence he will not reveal even to mewhich has been the immediate source of danforths present breakdown but it had to be for we could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible information and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity certain lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouragedviithe full story so far as deciphered will shortly appear in an official bulletin of miskatonic university here i shall sketch only the salient high lights in a formless rambling way myth or otherwise the sculptures told of the coming of those starheaded things to the nascent lifeless earth out of cosmic spacetheir coming and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark upon spatial pioneering they seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast membraneous wingsthus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague they had lived under the sea a good deal building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown principles of energy evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed mans today though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate forms only when obliged to some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage of mechanised life on other planets but had receded upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying their preternatural toughness of organisation and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live on a high plane without the more specialised fruits of artificial manufacture and even without garments except for occasional protection against the elementsit was under the sea at first for food and later for other purposes that they first created earthlifeusing available substances according to longknown methods the more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies they had done the same thing on other planets having manufactured not only necessary foods but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of moulding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the community these viscous masses were without doubt what abdul alhazred whispered about as the shoggoths in his frightfulnecronomiconthough even that mad arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb when the starheaded old ones on this planet had synthesised their simple food forms and bred a good supply of shoggoths they allowed other cellgroups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes extirpating any whose presence became troublesomewith the aid of the shoggoths whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights the small low cities under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land indeed the highly adaptable old ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe and probably retained many traditions of land construction as we studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities including that whose aeondead corridors we were even then traversing we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain even to ourselves the tops of the buildings which in the actual city around us had of course been weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago were clearly displayed in the basreliefs and shewed vast clusters of needlelike spires delicate finials on certain cone and pyramid apexes and tiers of thin horizontal scalloped discs capping cylindrical shafts this was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous mirage cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years which loomed on our ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first approached poor lakes illfated campof the life of the old ones both under the sea and after part of them migrated to land volumes could be written those in shallow water had continued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual waythe writing accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces those lower down in the ocean depths though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to furnish light pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their headssenses which rendered all the old ones partly independent of light in emergencies their forms of sculpture and writing had changed curiously during the descent embodying certain apparently chemical coating processesprobably to secure phosphorescencewhich the basreliefs could not make clear to us the beings moved in the sea partly by swimmingusing the lateral crinoid armsand partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudofeet occasionally they accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fanlike folding wings on land they locally used the pseudofeet but now and then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings the many slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate flexible strong and accurate in muscularnervous cordination ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operationsthe toughness of the things was almost incredible even the terrific pressures of the deepest seabottoms appeared powerless to harm them very few seemed to die at all except by violence and their burialplaces were very limited the fact that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with fivepointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it the beings multiplied by means of sporeslike vegetable pteridophytes as lake had suspectedbut owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity and consequent lack of replacement needs they did not encourage the largescale development of new prothalli except when they had new regions to colonise the young matured swiftly and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine the prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved and produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which i shall describe more fully in my coming monograph these varied slightly according to sea or land residence but had the same foundations and essentialsthough able like vegetables to derive nourishment from inorganic substances they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food they ate uncooked marine life under the sea but cooked their viands on land they hunted game and raised meat herdsslaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted they resisted all ordinary temperatures marvellously and in their natural state could live in water down to freezing when the great chill of the pleistocene drew on howevernearly a million years agothe land dwellers had to resort to special measures including artificial heating until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back into the sea for their prehistoric flights through cosmic space legend said they had absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating breathing or heat conditions but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method in any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harmbeing nonpairing and semivegetable in structure the old ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life but seemed to organise large households on the principles of comfortable spaceutility andas we deduced from the pictured occupations and diversions of codwellerscongenial mental association in furnishing their homes they kept everything in the centre of the huge rooms leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment lighting in the case of the land inhabitants was accomplished by a device probably electrochemical in nature both on land and under water they used curious tables chairs and couches like cylindrical framesfor they rested and slept upright with foldeddown tentaclesand racks for the hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their booksgovernment was evidently complex and probably socialistic though no certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw there was extensive commerce both local and between different cities certain small flat counters fivepointed and inscribed serving as money probably the smaller of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency though the culture was mainly urban some agriculture and much stockraising existed mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced travel was very frequent but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonising movements by which the race expanded for personal locomotion no external aid was used since in land air and water movement alike the old ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for speed loads however were drawn by beasts of burdenshoggoths under the sea and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existencethese vertebrates as well as an infinity of other lifeformsanimal and vegetable marine terrestrial and arialwere the products of unguided evolution acting on lifecells made by the old ones but escaping beyond their radius of attention they had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings bothersome forms of course were mechanically exterminated it interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling primitive mammal used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable in the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vastwinged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to palaeontologythe persistence with which the old ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the earths crust was little short of miraculous though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the archaean age there was no interruption in their civilisation or in the transmission of their records their original place of advent to the planet was the antarctic ocean and it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighbouring south pacific according to one of the sculptured maps the whole globe was then under water with stone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed another map shews a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements though their main centres were transferred to the nearest seabottom later maps which display this land mass as cracking and drifting and sending certain detached parts northward uphold in a striking way the theories of continental drift lately advanced by taylor wegener and jolywith the upheaval of new land in the south pacific tremendous events began some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered yet that was not the worst misfortune another racea land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous prehuman spawn of cthulhusoon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the old ones wholly back to the seaa colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements later peace was made and the new lands were given to the cthulhu spawn whilst the old ones held the sea and the older lands new land cities were foundedthe greatest of them in the antarctic for this region of first arrival was sacred from then on as before the antarctic remained the centre of the old ones civilisation and all the discoverable cities built there by the cthulhu spawn were blotted out then suddenly the lands of the pacific sank again taking with them the frightful stone city of rlyeh and all the cosmic octopi so that the old ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak at a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globehence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make systematic borings with pabodies type of apparatus in certain widely separated regionsthe steady trend down the ages was from water to land a movement encouraged by the rise of new land masses though the ocean was never wholly deserted another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the shoggoths upon which successful sealife depended with the march of time as the sculptures sadly confessed the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost so that the old ones had to depend on the moulding of forms already in existence on land the great reptiles proved highly tractable but the shoggoths of the sea reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence presented for a time a formidable problemthey had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestion of the old ones and had modelled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary limbs and organs but now their selfmodelling powers were sometimes exercised independently and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion they had it seems developed a semistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the old ones without always obeying it sculptured images of these shoggoths filled danforth and me with horror and loathing they were normally shapeless entities composed of a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles and each averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere they had however a constantly shifting shape and volume throwing out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight hearing and speech in imitation of their masters either spontaneously or according to suggestionthey seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the permian age perhaps 150 million years ago when a veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine old ones pictures of this war and of the headless slimecoated fashion in which the shoggoths typically left their slain victims held a marvellously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold ages the old ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against the rebel entities and in the end had achieved a complete victory thereafter the sculptures shewed a period in which shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed old ones as the wild horses of the american west were tamed by cowboys though during the rebellion the shoggoths had shewn an ability to live out of water this transition was not encouraged since their usefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble of their managementduring the jurassic age the old ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer spacethis time by halffungous halfcrustacean creatures from a planet identifiable as the remote and recently discovered pluto creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill legends of the north and remembered in the himalayas as the migo or abominable snowmen to fight these beings the old ones attempted for the first time since their terrene advent to sally forth again into the planetary ether but despite all traditional preparations found it no longer possible to leave the earths atmosphere whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been it was now definitely lost to the race in the end the migo drove the old ones out of all the northern lands though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea little by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginningit was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the cthulhu spawn and the migo seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the old ones they were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space the old ones but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties were strictly material and must have had their absolute origin within the known spacetime continuum whereas the first sources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath all this of course assuming that the nonterrestrial linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology conceivably the old ones might have invented a cosmic framework to account for their occasional defeats since historical interest and pride obviously formed their chief psychological element it is significant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure legendsthe changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes in certain cases existing science will require revision while in other cases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed as i have said the hypothesis of taylor wegener and joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower surfacean hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines of africa and south america and the way the great mountain chains are rolled and shoved upreceives striking support from this uncanny sourcemaps evidently shewing the carboniferous world of an hundred million or more years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate africa from the once continuous realms of europe then the valusia of hellish primal legend asia the americas and the antarctic continent other chartsand most significantly one in connexion with the founding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around usshewed all the present continents well differentiated and in the latest discoverable specimendating perhaps from the pliocene agethe approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of alaska with siberia of north america with europe through greenland and of south america with the antarctic continent through graham land in the carboniferous map the whole globeocean floor and rifted land mass alikebore symbols of the old ones vast stone cities but in the later charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very plain the final pliocene specimen shewed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of south america nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of south latitude knowledge and interest in the northern world save for a study of coastlines probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membraneous wings had evidently declined to zero among the old onesdestruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains the centrifugal rending of continents the seismic convulsions of land or seabottom and other natural causes was a matter of common record and it was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on the vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general centre of the race built early in the cretaceous age after a titanic earthbuckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant it appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all where reputedly the first old ones had settled on a primal seabottom in the new citymany of whose features we could recognise in the sculptures but which stretched fully an hundred miles along the mountainrange in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our arial surveythere were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming part of the first seabottom city which were thrust up to light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of strataviiinaturally danforth and i studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which we were of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance and on the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very late date whose walls though somewhat damaged by a neighbouring rift contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region much beyond the period of the pliocene map whence we derived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world this was the last place we examined in detail since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objectivecertainly we were in one of the strangest weirdest and most terrible of all the corners of earths globe of all existing lands it was infinitely the most ancient and the conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of leng which even the mad author of thenecronomiconwas reluctant to discuss the great mountain chain was tremendously longstarting as a low range at luitpold land on the coast of weddell sea and virtually crossing the entire continent the really high part stretched in a mighty arc from about latitude 82 e longitude 60 to latitude 70 e longitude 115 with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long icelocked coast whose hills were glimpsed by wilkes and mawson at the antarctic circleyet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at hand i have said that these peaks are higher than the himalayas but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earths highest that grim honour is beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to record at all whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation it seems that there was one part of the ancient landthe first part that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the old ones had seeped down from the starswhich had come to be shunned as vaguely and namelessly evil cities built there had crumbled before their time and had been found suddenly deserted then when the first great earthbuckling had convulsed the region in the comanchian age a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaosand earth had received her loftiest and most terrible mountainsif the scale of the carvings was correct these abhorred things must have been much over 40000 feet highradically vaster than even the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed they extended it appeared from about latitude 77 e longitude 70 to latitude 70 e longitude 100less than 300 miles away from the dead city so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague opalescent haze their northern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle coastline at queen mary landsome of the old ones in the decadent days had made strange prayers to those mountains but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond no human eye had ever seen them and as i studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings i prayed that none ever might there are protecting hills along the coast beyond themqueen mary and kaiser wilhelm landsand i thank heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills i am not as sceptical about old tales and fears as i used to be and i do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptors notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the brooding crests and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible pinnacles all through the long polar night there may be a very real and very monstrous meaning in the old pnakotic whispers about kadath in the cold wastebut the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange even if less namelessly accursed soon after the founding of the city the great mountainrange became the seat of the principal temples and many carvings shewed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts in the course of ages the caves had appeared and had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples with the advance of still later epochs all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters so that the mountains the foothills and the plains below them were a veritable network of connected caverns and galleries many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep underground and of the final discovery of the stygian sunless sea that lurked at earths bowelsthis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains and which had formerly turned at the base of the old ones range and flowed beside that chain into the indian ocean between budd and totten lands on wilkess coastline little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed the old ones understanding what had happened and exercising their always keen artistic sense had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darknessthis river once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges was plainly the one whose extinct course we had seen in our aroplane survey its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the regions agelong aeondead history so that we were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient featuressquares important buildings and the likefor guidance in further explorations we could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant tertiary vegetation had looked like it must have had a marvellous and mystic beauty and as i thought of it i almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the citys inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit yet according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror for there was a sombre and recurrent type of scene in which the old ones were shewn in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some objectnever allowed to appear in the designfound in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving vinedraped cycadforests from those horrible westward mountainsit was only in the one latebuilt house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the citys desertion undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period indeed very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward but this was the first and only set we directly encountered we meant to look farther later on but as i have said immediate conditions dictated another present objective there would though have been a limitfor after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the old ones there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration the ultimate blow of course was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall and which has never departed from the illfated polesthe great cold that at the worlds other extremity put an end to the fabled lands of lomar and hyperboreajust when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say in terms of exact years nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a distance of about 500000 years from the present but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier all quantitative estimates are partly guesswork but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably less than a million years ago and that the actual desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the pleistocene500000 years agoas reckoned in terms of the earths whole surfacein the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere and of a decreased country life on the part of the old ones heating devices were shewn in the houses and winter travellers were represented as muffled in protective fabrics then we saw a series of cartouches the continuous band arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings depicting a constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmthsome fleeing to cities under the sea off the faraway coast and some clambering down through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighbouring black abyss of subterrene watersin the end it seems to have been the neighbouring abyss which received the greatest colonisation this was partly due no doubt to the traditional sacredness of this especial region but may have been more conclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains and for retaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of communication with various mines the linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes including the chiselling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abysssharply downpointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew according to our most thoughtful estimates on the guide map we were compiling it was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where we were both being on the mountainward edge of the city one less than a quartermile toward the ancient rivercourse and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite directionthe abyss it seems had shelving shores of dry land at certain places but the old ones built their new city under waterno doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth the depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great so that the earths internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite period the beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to parttimeand eventually of course wholetimeresidence under water since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy there were many sculptures which shewed how they had always frequently visited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great river the darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nightsdecadent though their style undoubtedly was these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea the old ones had gone about it scientifically quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains and employing expert workers from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods these workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new ventureshoggothtissue from which to breed stonelifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city and other protoplasmic matter to mould into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposesat last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that stygian sea its architecture much like that of the city above and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent in building operations the newly bred shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular intelligence and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvellous quickness they seemed to converse with the old ones by mimicking their voicesa sort of musical piping over a wide range if poor lakes dissection had indicated arightand to work more from spoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times they were however kept in admirable control the phosphorescent organisms supplied light with vast effectiveness and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outerworld nightart and decoration were pursued though of course with a certain decadence the old ones seemed to realise this falling off themselves and in many cases anticipated the policy of constantine the great by transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city just as the emperor in a similar age of decline stripped greece and asia of their finest art to give his new byzantine capital greater splendours than its own people could create that the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned by the time total abandonment did occurand it surely must have occurred before the polar pleistocene was far advancedthe old ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent artor had ceased to recognise the superior merit of the older carvings at any rate the aeonsilent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation though all the best separate statues like other moveables had been taken awaythe decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were as i have said the latest we could find in our limited search they left us with a picture of the old ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the seacavern city in winter and sometimes trading with the seabottom cities off the antarctic coast by this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised for the sculptures shewed many signs of the colds malign encroachments vegetation was declining and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer the saurian livestock were nearly all dead and the mammals were standing it none too well to keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously coldresistant shoggoths to land life a thing the old ones had formerly been reluctant to do the great river was now lifeless and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales all the birds had flown away save only the great grotesque penguinswhat had happened afterward we could only guess how long had the new seacavern city survived was it still down there a stony corpse in eternal blackness had the subterranean waters frozen at last to what fate had the oceanbottom cities of the outer world been delivered had any of the old ones shifted north ahead of the creeping icecap existing geology shews no trace of their presence had the frightful migo been still a menace in the outer land world of the north could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earths deepest waters those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressureand men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times and has the killerwhale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by borchgrevingkthe specimens found by poor lake did not enter into these guesses for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land citys history they were according to their location certainly not less than thirty million years old and we reflected that in their day the seacavern city and indeed the cavern itself had no existence they would have remembered an older scene with lush tertiary vegetation everywhere a younger land city of flourishing arts around them and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a faraway tropic oceanand yet we could not help thinking about these specimensespecially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from lakes hideously ravaged camp there was something abnormal about that whole businessthe strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebodys madnessthose frightful gravesthe amountand natureof the missing materialgedneythe unearthly toughness of those archaic monstrosities and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now shewed the race to have danforth and i had seen a good deal in the last few hours and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible secrets of primal natureixi have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our immediate objective this of course had to do with the chiselled avenues to the black inner world of whose existence we had not known before but which we were now eager to find and traverse from the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighbouring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy sunless cliffs above the great abyss down whose side adequate paths improved by the old ones led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean to behold this fabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of the thingyet we realised we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include it on our present flightit was now 8 pm and we had not enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever we had done so much of our studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use and despite the special dry cell formula would obviously be good for only about four morethough by keeping one torch unused except for especially interesting or difficult places we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that it would not do to be without a light in these cyclopean catacombs hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photographycuriosity having long ago got the better of horrorbut just now we must hasten our supply of trailblazing paper was far from unlimited and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it but we did let one large notebook go if worst came to worst we could resort to rockchippingand of course it would be possible even in case of really lost direction to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error so at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnelaccording to the carvings from which we had made our map the desired tunnelmouth could not be much more than a quartermile from where we stood the intervening space shewing solidlooking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a subglacial level the opening itself would be in the basementon the angle nearest the foothillsof a vast fivepointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature which we tried to identify from our arial survey of the ruins no such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged or that it had been totally shattered in an icerift we had noticed in the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked so that we would have to try the next nearest onethe one less than a mile to the north the intervening rivercourse prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip and indeed if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly oneabout a mile beyond our second choiceas we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compasstraversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation clambering up ramps crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again encountering choked doorways and piles of debris hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches taking false leads and retracing our way in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled downwe were repeatedly tantalised by the sculptured walls along our route many must have told tales of immense historical importance and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by as it was we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch if we had had more films we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain basreliefs but timeconsuming hand copying was clearly out of the questioni come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate or to hint rather than state is very strong it is necessary however to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration we had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnels mouthhaving crossed a secondstory bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanshipwhen about 830 pm danforths keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual if we had had a dog with us i suppose we would have been warned before at first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystalpure air but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely let me try to state the thing without flinching there was an odourand that odour was vaguely subtly and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the horror poor lake had dissectedof course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now there were several conceivable explanations and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering most important of all we did not retreat without further investigation for having come this far we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster anyway what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe such things did not happen in any normal world it was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torchtempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from the oppressive wallsand which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debrisdanforths eyes as well as nose proved better than mine for it was likewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many halfchoked arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level it did not look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it the irregular nature of the litter precluded any definite marks but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as if of runners this was what made us pause againit was during that pause that we caughtsimultaneously this timethe other odour ahead paradoxically it was both a less frightful and a more frightful odourless frightful intrinsically but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances unless of course gedney for the odour was the plain and familiar one of common petroleveryday gasolineour motivation after that is something i will leave to psychologists we knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this nighted burialplace of the aeons hence could not doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditionspresent or at least recentjust ahead yet in the end we did let sheer burning curiosityor anxietyor autohypnotismor vague thoughts of responsibility toward gedneyor what notdrive us on danforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at the alleyturning in the ruins above and of the faint musical pipingpotentially of tremendous significance in the light of lakes dissection report despite its close resemblance to the cavemouth echoes of the windy peakswhich he thought he had shortly afterward half heard from unknown depths below i in my turn whispered of how the camp was leftof what had disappeared and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have conceived the inconceivablea wild trip across the monstrous mountains and a descent into the unknown primal masonrybut we could not convince each other or even ourselves of anything definite we had turned off all light as we stood still and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute having automatically begun to move ahead we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch the disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off and the smell of gasoline grew stronger more and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease we had been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air our tunnel quest was a blind one and we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture openedthe torch flashing over the grotesquely carven walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood shewed several doorways in various states of obstruction and from one of them the gasoline odourquite submerging that other hint of odourcame with especial distinctness as we looked more steadily we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from that particular opening whatever the lurking horror might be we believed the direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest i do not think anyone will wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motionand yet when we did venture inside that black arch our first impression was one of anticlimax for amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypta perfect cube with sides of about twenty feetthere remained no recent object of instantly discernible size so that we looked instinctively though in vain for a farther doorway in another moment however danforths sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed and we turned on both torches full strength though what we saw in that light was actually simple and trifling i am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied it was a rough levelling of the debris upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odour even at this extreme superplateau altitude in other words it could not be other than a sort of campa camp made by questing beings who like us had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way to the abysslet me be plain the scattered objects were so far as substance was concerned all from lakes camp and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place many spent matches three illustrated books more or less curiously smudged an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional carton a broken fountain pen some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tentcloth a used electric battery with circular of directions a folder that came with our type of tent heater and a sprinkling of crumpled papers it was all bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them we felt we had come to the worst we had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us yet the effect of the sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to beara mad gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones just as the dots on those insane fivepointed gravemounds might have been made and he might conceivably have prepared rough hasty sketchesvarying in their accuracy or lack of itwhich outlined the neighbouring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside our previous routea place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our arial surveyto the present fivepointed structure and the tunnelmouth therein he might i repeat have prepared such sketches for those before us were quite obviously compiled as our own had been from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth though not from the ones which we had seen and used but what this artblind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior despite haste and carelessness to any of the decadent carvings from which they were takenthe characteristic and unmistakable technique of the old ones themselves in the dead citys heydaythere are those who will say danforth and i were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that since our conclusions were nownotwithstanding their wildnesscompletely fixed and of a nature i need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this perhaps we were madfor have i not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness but i think i can detect something of the same spiritalbeit in a less extreme formin the men who stalk deadly beasts through african jungles to photograph them or study their habits halfparalysed with terror though we were there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the endof course we did not mean to face thator thosewhich we knew had been there but we felt that they must be gone by now they would by this time have found the other neighbouring entrance to the abyss and have passed within to whatever nightblack fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulfthe ultimate gulf they had never seen or if that entrance too was blocked they would have gone on to the north seeking another they were we remembered partly independent of lightlooking back to that moment i can scarcely recall just what precise form our new emotions tookjust what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our sense of expectancy we certainly did not mean to face what we fearedyet i will not deny that we may have had a lurking unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantagepoint probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shewn on the crumpled sketches we had found we had at once recognised it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above something about the impressiveness of its rendering even in these hasty diagrams made us think that its subglacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us it was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figuredbeing indeed among the first things built in the city its carvings if preserved could not but be highly significant moreover it might form a good present link with the upper worlda shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing and probably that by which those others had descendedat any rate the thing we did was to study the terrible sketcheswhich quite perfectly confirmed our ownand start back over the indicated course to the circular place the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us the other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that i need not speak of our journeyduring which we continued to leave an economical trail of paperfor it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul de sac except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter under foot and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent we were again faintly consciousspasmodicallyof that more hideous and more persistent scent after the way had branched from our former course we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls noting in almost every case the wellnigh omnipresent sculptures which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the old onesabout 930 pm while traversing a vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch it appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great the corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins but we could see much through it even before we emerged beyond there stretched a prodigious round spacefully 200 feet in diameterstrown with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross the walls werein available spacesboldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions and displayed despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot an artistic splendour far beyond anything we had encountered before the littered floor was quite heavily glaciated and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depthbut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique babylon only the rapidity of our flight and the perspective which confounded the descent with the towers inner wall had prevented our noticing this feature from the air and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place but danforth and i could merely admire and marvel we could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed the thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the towera highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposureand its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the wallsas we stepped out into the awesome halfdaylight of this monstrous cylinderbottomfifty million years old and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyeswe saw that the ramptraversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet this we recalled from our arial survey meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twentyfoot mound of crumbled masonry somewhat sheltered for threefourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins according to the sculptures the original tower had stood in the centre of an immense circular plaza and had been perhaps 500 or 600 feet high with tiers of horizontal discs near the top and a row of needlelike spires along the upper rim most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inwarda fortunate happening since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole interior choked as it was the ramp shewed sad battering whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently halfclearedit took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere the towers mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region oddly we were still thinking about possible later tripseven after all we had seen and guessed then as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor there came a sight which for the time excluded all other mattersit was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramps lower and outwardprojecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view there they werethe three sledges missing from lakes campshaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places they were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped and contained things memorably familiar enoughthe gasoline stove fuel cans instrument cases provision tins tarpaulins obviously bulging with books and some bulging with less obvious contentseverything derived from lakes equipment after what we had found in that other room we were in a measure prepared for this encounter the really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us it seems that others as well as lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens for there were two here both stiffly frozen perfectly preserved patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred and wrapped with patent care to prevent further damage they were the bodies of young gedney and the missing dogxmany people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery and i am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations we had replaced the tarpaulin over poor gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousnessthe first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights well known and mundane though they were their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have beensince they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmonyhad it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which lakes dissection report had led us to expect in those othersand which indeed our overwrought fancies had been reading into every windhowl we had heard since coming on the camp horrorit would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the aeondead region around us a voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs as it was however the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustmentsall our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste as utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life as the sterile disc of the moon what we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an agedenied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response instead it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarised by our sea days off victoria land and our camp days at mcmurdo sound that we shuddered to think of it here where such things ought not to be to be briefit was simply the raucous squawking of a penguinthe muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had comeregions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss the presence of a living waterbird in such a directionin a world whose surface was one of agelong and uniform lifelessnesscould lead to only one conclusion hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound it was indeed repeated and seemed at times to come from more than one throat seeking its source we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared resuming our trailblazingwith an added papersupply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the sledgeswhen we left daylight behindas the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus we plainly discerned some curious dragging tracks and once danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous the course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more northerly tunnelmouth and we were glad to find that a bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open the tunnel according to the chart ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our arial survey as remarkably well preserved along our path the single torch shewed a customary profusion of carvings but we did not pause to examine any of thesesuddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us and we flashed on the second torch it is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near those other ones having left their supplies in the great circular place must have planned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as if they had never existed this white waddling thing was fully six feet high yet we seemed to realise at once that it was not one of those others they were larger and dark and according to the sculptures their motion over land surfaces was a swift assured matter despite the queerness of their seaborn tentacle equipment but to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain we were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones for it was only a penguinalbeit of a huge unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessnesswhen we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the old ones sculptures and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stockundoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits that their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought was not for a moment to be doubted and this evidence of the gulfs continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancieswe wondered too what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain the state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply we doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the old onesan amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the old ones remained regrettingin a flareup of the old spirit of pure sciencethat we could not photograph these anomalous creatures we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clearnot long afterward a steep descent in a long low doorless and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnelmouth at last we had passed two more penguins and heard others immediately ahead then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarilya perfect inverted hemisphere obviously deep underground fully an hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one and that one yawning cavernously with a black arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet it was the entrance to the great abyssin this vast hemisphere whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome a few albino penguins waddledaliens there but indifferent and unseeing the black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep descending grade its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiselled jambs and lintel from that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air and perhaps even a suspicion of vapour proceeded and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains might conceal we wondered too whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected by poor lake as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampartcrowned peak might not be caused by the tortuouschannelled rising of some such vapour from the unfathomed regions of earths coreentering the tunnel we saw that its outline wasat least at the startabout fifteen feet each way sides floor and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry the sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late decadent style and all the construction and carving were marvellously well preserved the floor was quite clear except for a slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of those others the farther one advanced the warmer it became so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments we wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below and whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot after a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved regularity occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut in the floor several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss the nameless scent of such things was very distinct doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspectindeed it was just such a lure which had brought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place we saw several penguins as we passed along and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse the carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss but our previous wanderings had shewn us that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended onafter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed there was no visible vapour as at the mouth but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air the temperature was rapidly ascending and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us it was composed of furs and tentcloth taken from lakes camp and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the sidegalleries and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached the nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odourof what nature we could not guess though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared usa broadening and rising into a lofty naturallooking elliptical cavern with a level floor some 75 feet long and 50 broad and with many immense sidepassages leading away into cryptical darknessthough this cavern was natural in appearance an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings the walls were rough and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off and was free from all debris detritus or even dust to a positively abnormal extent except for the avenue through which we had come this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling the curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other something about this whole place with its polished and almost glistening floor struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encounteredthe regularity of the passage immediately ahead as well as the larger proportion of penguindroppings there prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cavemouths nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop for dust tracks of course could no longer be expected upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel wallsand stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage we realised of course the great decadence of the old ones sculpture at the time of the tunnelling and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us but now in this deeper section beyond the cavern there was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanationa difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect itthis new and degenerate work was coarse bold and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail it was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier sections but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface danforth had the idea that it was a second carvinga sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design in nature it was wholly decorative and conventional and consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of the old ones yet seeming more like a parody than a perpetuation of that tradition we could not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling behind the techniquean alien element danforth guessed that was responsible for the manifestly laborious substitution it was like yet disturbingly unlike what we had come to recognise as the old ones art and i was persistently reminded of such hybrid things as the ungainly palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the roman manner that others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the presence of a used torch battery on the floor in front of one of the most characteristic designssince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study we resumed our advance after a cursory look though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes developed nothing of the sort was perceived though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smoothfloored lateral tunnels we saw and heard fewer penguins but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth the new and inexplicable odour was abominably strong and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent puffs of visible vapour ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature and the relative nearness of the sunless seacliffs of the great abyss then quite unexpectedly we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor aheadobstructions which were quite definitely not penguinsand turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationaryxistill another time have i come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed i ought to be hardened by this stage but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing and leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror we saw as i have said certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead and i may add that our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing foetor now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before us the light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were and we dared approach them only because we could see even from a distance that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous starmounded graves at poor lakes campthey were indeed as lacking in completeness as most of those we had unearthedthough it grew plain from the thick darkgreen pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency there seemed to be only four of them whereas lakes bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us to find them in this state was wholly unexpected and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the darkpenguins attacked in a body retaliate savagely with their beaks and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit the obstructions did not suggest it for penguin beaks against the tough tissues lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make out besides the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peacefulhad there then been a struggle among those others and were the absent four responsible if so where were they were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us we glanced anxiously at some of the smoothfloored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant approach whatever the conflict was it had clearly been that which had frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering it must then have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here perhaps we reflected there had been a hideous running fight with the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them one could picture the daemoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying aheadi say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly would to heaven we had never approached them at all but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had supersededrun back before we had seen what we did see and before our minds were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily againboth of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects so that we soon realised the dominant factor in their incompleteness mauled compressed twisted and ruptured as they were their chief common injury was total decapitation from each one the tentacled starfishhead had been removed and as we drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage their noisome darkgreen ichor formed a large spreading pool but its stench was half overshadowed by that newer and stranger stench here more pungent than at any other point along our route only when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that second unexplainable foetor to any immediate sourceand the instant we did so danforth remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the old ones history in the permian age 150 million years ago gave vent to a nervetortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil palimpsest carvingsi came only just short of echoing his cry myself for i had seen those primal sculptures too and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slimecoating found on certain incomplete and prostrate old onesthose whom the frightful shoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation they were infamous nightmare sculptures even when telling of ageold bygone things for shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any beings the mad author of thenecronomiconhad nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet and that only drugged dreamers had ever conceived them formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processesviscous agglutinations of bubbling cellsrubbery fifteenfoot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductileslaves of suggestion builders of citiesmore and more sullen more and more intelligent more and more amphibious more and more imitativegreat god what madness made even those blasphemous old ones willing to use and to carve such thingsand now when danforth and i saw the freshly glistening and reflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank obscenely with that new unknown odour whose cause only a diseased fancy could envisageclung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wallin a series of grouped dotswe understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths it was not fear of those four missing othersfor all too well did we suspect they would do no harm again poor devils after all they were not evil things of their kind they were the men of another age and another order of being nature had played a hellish jest on themas it will on any others that human madness callousness or cruelty may hereafter drag up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar wasteand this was their tragic homecomingthey had not been even savagesfor what indeed had they done that awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epochperhaps an attack by the furry frantically barking quadrupeds and a dazed defence against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia poor lake poor gedney and poor old ones scientists to the lastwhat had they done that we would not have done in their place god what intelligence and persistence what a facing of the incredible just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less incredible radiates vegetables monstrosities starspawnwhatever they had been they were menthey had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once worshipped and roamed among the treeferns they had found their dead city brooding under its curse and had read its carven latter days as we had done they had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they had never seenand what had they found all this flashed in unison through the thoughts of danforth and me as we looked from those headless slimecoated shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dotgroups of fresh slime on the wall beside themlooked and understood what must have triumphed and survived down there in the cyclopean watercity of that nighted penguinfringed abyss whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to belch pallidly as if in answer to danforths hysterical screamthe shock of recognising that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us into mute motionless statues and it is only through later conversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment it seemed aeons that we stood there but actually it could not have been more than ten or fifteen seconds that hateful pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulkand then came a sound which upset much of what we had just decided and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking confused penguins over our former trail back to the city along icesunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle and up that archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied automatic plunge for the sane outer air and light of daythe new sound as i have intimated upset much that we had decided because it was what poor lakes dissection had led us to attribute to those we had just judged dead it was danforth later told me precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alleycorner above the glacial level and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the windpipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves at the risk of seeming puerile i will add another thing too if only because of the surprising way danforths impression chimed with mine of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the interpretation though danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden sources to which poe may have had access when writing hisarthur gordon pyma century ago it will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally snowy birds of that malign regions coretekelili tekelilithat i may admit is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mistthat insidious musical piping over a singularly wide rangewe were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered though we knew that the swiftness of the old ones would enable any screamroused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished to do so we had a vague hope however that nonaggressive conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture if only from scientific curiosity after all if such an one had nothing to fear for itself it would have no motive in harming us concealment being futile at this juncture we used our torch for a running glance behind and perceived that the mist was thinning would we see at last a complete and living specimen of those others again came that insidious musical pipingtekelili tekelilithen noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer it occurred to us that the entity might be wounded we could take no chances however since it was very obviously approaching in answer to danforths scream rather than in flight from any other entity the timing was too close to admit of doubt of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmarethat foetid unglimpsed mountain of slimespewing protoplasm whose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of the hillswe could form no guess and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled old oneperhaps a lone survivorto the peril of recapture and a nameless fatethank heaven we did not slacken our run the curling mist had thickened again and was driving ahead with increased speed whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them once more came that sinister wideranged pipingtekelili tekeliliwe had been wrong the thing was not wounded but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above them we could never know what that daemon message wasbut those burials at lakes camp had shewn how much importance the beings attached to their dead our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculpturesalmost felt even when scarcely seenbehindanother thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries there were several of the blind albino penguins in the open space and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability if at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of travelling need keeping it strictly in front of us the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our footfalls screen our true course and somehow set up a false lead amidst the churning spiralling fog the littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point as differing from the other morbidly polished burrows could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature even so far as we could conjecture for those indicated special senses which made the old ones partly though imperfectly independent of light in emergencies in fact we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste for we had of course decided to keep straight on toward the dead city since the consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkablethe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one the penguins alone could not have saved us but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so only a benign fate kept the curling vapours thick enough at the right moment for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish indeed they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave so that we actually caught one first and only halfglimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit if the fate which screened us was benign that which gave us the halfglimpse was infinitely the opposite for to that flash of semivision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted usour exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses in the midst of our flight with all our faculties centred on the problem of escape we were in no condition to observe and analyse details yet even so our latent braincells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils afterward we realised what it wasthat our retreat from the foetid slimecoating on those headless obstructions and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for in the neighbourhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable foetor had been wholly dominant but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those others this it had not donefor instead the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted and growing more and more poisonously insistent each secondso we glanced backsimultaneously it would appear though no doubt the incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other as we did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinthcentre ahead unhappy act not orpheus himself or lots wife paid much more dearly for a backward glance and again came that shocking wideranged pipingtekelili tekelilii might as well be frankeven if i cannot bear to be quite directin stating what we saw though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other the words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself it crippled our consciousness so completely that i wonder we had the residual sense to dim our torches as planned and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city instinct alone must have carried us throughperhaps better than reason could have done though if that was what saved us we paid a high price of reason we certainly had little enough left danforth was totally unstrung and the first thing i remember of the rest of the journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which i alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance it reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins reverberated through the vaultings ahead andthank godthrough the now empty vaultings behind he could not have begun it at onceelse we would not have been alive and blindly racing i shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous reactions might have broughtsouth station underwashington underpark street underkendallcentralharvard the poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the bostoncambridge tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in new england yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor homefeeling it had only horror because i knew unerringly the monstrous nefandous analogy that had suggested it we had expected upon looking back to see a terrible and incredibly moving entity if the mists were thin enough but of that entity we had formed a clear idea what we did seefor the mists were indeed all too malignly thinnedwas something altogether different and immeasurably more hideous and detestable it was the utter objective embodiment of the fantastic novelists thing that should not be and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platformthe great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterraneous distance constellated with strangely coloured lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinderbut we were not on a station platform we were on the track ahead as the nightmare plastic column of foetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its fifteenfoot sinus gathering unholy speed and driving before it a spiral rethickening cloud of the pallid abyssvapour it was a terrible indescribable thing vaster than any subway traina shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles faintly selfluminous and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnelfilling front that bore down upon us crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter still came that eldritch mocking crytekelili tekeliliand at last we remembered that the daemoniac shoggothsgiven life thought and plastic organ patterns solely by the old ones and having no language save that which the dotgroups expressedhad likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone mastersxiidanforth and i have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city yet these are purely dreamfragments involving no memory of volition details or physical exertion it was as if we floated in a nebulous world or dimension without time causation or orientation the grey halfdaylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat but we did not go near those cached sledges or look again at poor gedney and the dog they have a strange and titanic mausoleum and i hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbedit was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced but not even the fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky there was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs for as we wound our panting way up the sixtyfoot cylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead races early and undecayed techniquea farewell from the old ones written fifty million years agofinally scrambling out at the top we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward and the brooding peaks of the great mountains shewing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east the low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins and the terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape the sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous icevapours and the cold clutched at our vitals wearily resting the outfitbags to which we had instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the aeonold stone maze to the foothills where our aroplane waited of what had set us fleeing from the darkness of earths secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at allin less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothillsthe probable ancient terraceby which we had descended and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead half way uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathingspell and turned to look again at the fantastic palaeogean tangle of incredible stone shapes below usonce more outlined mystically against an unknown west as we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness the restless icevapours having moved up to the zenith where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusivethere now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needlepointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rosecolour of the western sky up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient tableland the depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow for a second we gasped in admiration of the scenes unearthly cosmic beauty and then vague horror began to creep into our souls for this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden landhighest of earths peaks and focus of earths evil harbourers of nameless horrors and archaean secrets shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning untrodden by any living thing of earth but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar nightbeyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded kadath in the cold waste beyond abhorrent leng whereof unholy primal legends hint evasively we were the first human beings ever to see themand i hope to god we may be the lastif the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than 300 miles away yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence jut above that remote and snowy rim like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens their height then must have been tremendous beyond all known comparisoncarrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls looking at them i thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopesand wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those old ones who carved them so reticently i recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at queen mary land where even at that moment sir douglas mawsons expedition was doubtless working less than a thousand miles away and hoped that no evil fate would give sir douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the timeand danforth seemed to be even worseyet long before we had passed the great starshaped ruin and reached our plane our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast enough range whose recrossing lay ahead of us from these foothills the black ruincrusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east again reminding us of those strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich and when we thought of the damnable honeycombs inside them and of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their foetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles we could not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cavemouths where the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range to make matters worse we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summitsas poor lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanismand thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped of that and of the blasphemous horrorfostering abyss whence all such vapours cameall was well with the plane and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs danforth got the engine started without trouble and we made a very smooth takeoff over the nightmare city below us the primal cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw itso short yet infinitely long a time agoand we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass at a very high level there must have been great disturbance since the icedust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things but at 24000 feet the height we needed for the pass we found navigation quite practicable as we drew close to the jutting peaks the winds strange piping again became manifest and i could see danforths hands trembling at the controls rank amateur though i was i thought at that moment that i might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles and when i made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest i tried to keep all my skill and selfpossession about me and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the passresolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountaintop vapour and wishing that i had waxstopped ears like ulysses men off the sirens coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousnessbut danforth released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch could not keep quiet i felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city ahead at the caveriddled cubebarnacled peaks sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy rampartstrown foothills and upward at the seething grotesquely clouded sky it was then just as i was trying to steer safely through the pass that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment a second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safelyyet i am afraid that danforth will never be the same againi have said that danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanelya horror which i feel sadly sure is mainly responsible for his present breakdown we had snatches of shouted conversation above the winds piping and the engines buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city certain things we had agreed were not for people to know and discuss lightlyand i would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that starkweathermoore expedition and others at any cost it is absolutely necessary for the peace and safety of mankind that some of earths dark dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquestsall that danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage it was not he declares anything connected with the cubes and caves of echoing vaporous wormily honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed but a single fantastic daemoniac glimpse among the churning zenithclouds of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the old ones had shunned and feared it is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed through and of the actual though unrecognised mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near lakes camp the day before but it was so real to danforth that he suffers from it stillhe has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about the black pit the carven rim the protoshoggoths the windowless solids with five dimensions the nameless cylinder the elder pharos yogsothoth the primal white jelly the colour out of space the wings the eyes in darkness the moonladder the original the eternal the undying and other bizarre conceptions but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years danforth indeed is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that wormriddled copy of thenecronomiconkept under lock and key in the college librarythe higher sky as we crossed the range was surely vaporous and disturbed enough and although i did not see the zenith i can well imagine that its swirls of icedust may have taken strange forms imagination knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected refracted and magnified by such layers of restless cloud might easily have supplied the restand of course danforth did not hint any of those specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance to draw on his bygone reading he could never have seen so much in one instantaneous glanceat the time his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single mad word of all too obvious sourcetekelili tekelili,1
when age fell upon the world and wonder went out of the minds of men when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly in whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of springs flowering meads when learning stripped earth of her mantle of beauty and poets sang no more save of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and inwardlooking eyes when these things had come to pass and childish hopes had gone away forever there was a man who travelled out of life on a quest into the spaces whither the worlds dreams had fledof the name and abode of this man but little is written for they were of the waking world only yet it is said that both were obscure it is enough to know that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned and that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not on the fields and groves but on a dim court where other windows stared in dull despair from that casement one might see only walls and windows except sometimes when one leaned far out and peered aloft at the small stars that passed and because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man who dreams and reads much the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the greyness of tall cities after years he began to call the slowsailing stars by name and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existence no common eye suspects and one night a mighty gulf was bridged and the dreamhaunted skies swelled down to the lonely watchers window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonderthere came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold vortices of dust and fire swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds opiate oceans poured there litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and seanymphs of unrememberable deeps noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window and for days not counted in mens calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed the dreams that men have lost and in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore a green shore fragrant with lotusblossoms and starred by red camalotes,1

the horrible conclusion which had been gradually obtruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty i was lost completely hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recesses of the mammoth cave turn as i might in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path that nevermore should i behold the blessed light of day or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world outside my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief hope had departed yet indoctrinated as i was by a life of philosophical study i derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour for although i had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations i experienced none of these but stood quiet as soon as i clearly realised the loss of my bearingsnor did the thought that i had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment if i must die i reflected then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford a conception which carried with it more of tranquility than of despairstarving would prove my ultimate fate of this i was certain some i knew had gone mad under circumstances such as these but i felt that this end would not be mine my disaster was the result of no fault save my own since unbeknown to the guide i had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers and wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which i had pursued since forsaking my companionsalready my torch had begun to expire soon i would be enveloped by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth as i stood in the waning unsteady light i idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my coming end i remembered the accounts which i had heard of the colony of consumptives who taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world with its steady uniform temperature pure air and peaceful quiet had found instead death in strange and ghastly form i had seen the sad remains of their illmade cottages as i passed them by with the party and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and as vigorous as i now i grimly told myself my opportunity for settling this point had arrived provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this lifeas the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity i resolved to leave no stone unturned no possible means of escape neglected so summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs i set up a series of loud shoutings in the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamour yet as i called i believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose and that my voice magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me fell upon no ears save my own all at once however my attention was fixed with a start as i fancied that i heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the cavern was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon had then all my horrible apprehensions been for naught and was the guide having marked my unwarranted absence from the party following my course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain i was on the point of renewing my cries in order that my discovery might come the sooner when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as i listened for my ever acute ear now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence of the cave bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and dreadful knowledge that these footfalls werenot like those of any mortal manin the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region the tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive blows these impacts were soft and stealthy as of the padded paws of some feline besidesat timeswhen i listened carefully i seemed to trace the falls offourinstead oftwofeeti was now convinced that i had by my cries aroused and attracted some wild beast perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the cave perhaps i considered the almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that of hunger yet the instinct of selfpreservation never wholly dormant was stirred in my breast and though escape from the oncoming peril might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end i determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as i could command strange as it may seem my mind conceived of no intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility accordingly i became very quiet in the hope that the unknown beast would in the absence of a guiding sound lose its direction as had i and thus pass me by but this hope was not destined for realisation for the strange footfalls steadily advanced the animal evidently having obtained my scent which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as is that of the cave could doubtless be followed at great distanceseeing therefore that i must be armed for defence against an uncanny and unseen attack in the dark i grouped about me the largest of the fragments of rock which were strown upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the vicinity and grasping one in each hand for immediate use awaited with resignation the inevitable result meanwhile the hideous pattering of the paws drew near certainly the conduct of the creature was exceedingly strange most of the time the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped walking with a singularlack of unisonbetwixt hind and fore feet yet at brief and infrequent intervals i fancied that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion i wondered what species of animal was to confront me it must i thought be some unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a lifelong confinement in its interminable recesses it doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish bats and rats of the cave as well as some of the ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of green river which communicates in some occult manner with the waters of the cave i occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alterations cave life might have wrought in the physical structure of the beast remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cavern then i remembered with a start that even should i succeed in killing my antagonist i shouldnever behold its formas my torch had long since been extinct and i was entirely unprovided with matches the tension on my brain now became frightful my disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me and that actually seemed topressupon my body nearer nearer the dreadful footfalls approached it seemed that i must give vent to a piercing scream yet had i been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing my voice could scarce have responded i was petrified rooted to the spot i doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive now the steadypat patof the steps was close at hand nowveryclose i could hear the laboured breathing of the animal and terrorstruck as i was i realised that it must have come from a considerable distance and was correspondingly fatigued suddenly the spell broke my right hand guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing threw with full force the sharpangled bit of limestone which it contained toward that point in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering and wonderful to relate it nearly reached its goal for i heard the thing jump landing at a distance away where it seemed to pausehaving readjusted my aim i discharged my second missile this time most effectively for with a flood of joy i listened as the creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me i reeled back against the wall the breathing continued in heavy gasping inhalations and expirations whence i realised that i had no more than wounded the creature and now all desire to examine thethingceased at last something allied to groundless superstitious fear had entered my brain and i did not approach the body nor did i continue to cast stones at it in order to complete the extinction of its life instead i ran at full speed in what was as nearly as i could estimate in my frenzied condition the direction from which i had come suddenly i heard a sound or rather a regular succession of sounds in another instant they had resolved themselves into a series of sharp metallic clicks this time there was no doubtit was the guideand then i shouted yelled screamed even shrieked with joy as i beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering effulgence which i knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch i ran to meet the flare and before i could completely understand what had occurred was lying upon the ground at the feet of the guide embracing his boots and gibbering despite my boasted reserve in a most meaningless and idiotic manner pouring out my terrible story and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with protestations of gratitude at length i awoke to something like my normal consciousness the guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party at the entrance of the cave and had from his own intuitive sense of direction proceeded to make a thorough canvass of the bypassages just ahead of where he had last spoken to me locating my whereabouts after a quest of about four hoursby the time he had related this to me i emboldened by his torch and his company began to reflect upon the strange beast which i had wounded but a short distance back in the darkness and suggested that we ascertain by the rushlights aid what manner of creature was my victim accordingly i retraced my steps this time with a courage born of companionship to the scene of my terrible experience soon we descried a white object upon the floor an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself cautiously advancing we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment for of all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld this was in surpassing degree the strangest it appeared to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions escaped perhaps from some itinerant menagerie its hair was snowwhite a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the cave but it was also surprisingly thin being indeed largely absent save on the head where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in considerable profusion the face was turned away from us as the creature lay almost directly upon it the inclination of the limbs was very singular explaining however the alternation in their use which i had before noted whereby the beast used sometimes all four and on other occasions but two for its progress from the tips of the fingers or toes long naillike claws extended the hands or feet were not prehensile a fact that i ascribed to that long residence in the cave which as i before mentioned seemed evident from the allpervading and almost unearthlywhitenessso characteristic of the whole anatomy no tail seemed to be presentthe respiration had now grown very feeble and the guide had drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature when a suddensoundemitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused the sound was of a nature difficult to describe it was not like the normal note of any known species of simian and i wondered if this unnatural quality were not the result of a longcontinued and complete silence broken by the sensations produced by the advent of the light a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first entrance into the cave the sound which i might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of deeptoned chattering was faintly continued all at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of the beast the paws went through a convulsive motion and the limbs contracted with a jerk the white body rolled over so that its face was turned in our direction for a moment i was so struck with horror at the eyes thus revealed that i noted nothing else they were black those eyes deep jetty black in hideous contrast to the snowwhite hair and flesh like those of other cave denizens they were deeply sunken in their orbits and were entirely destitute of iris as i looked more closely i saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the average ape and infinitely more hairy the nose was quite distinctas we gazed upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision the thick lips opened and severalsoundsissued from them after which thethingrelaxed in deaththe guide clutched my coatsleeve and trembled so violently that the light shook fitfully casting weird moving shadows on the walls about usi made no motion but stood rigidly still my horrified eyes fixed upon the floor aheadthen fear left and wonder awe compassion and reverence succeeded in its place for thesoundsuttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth the creature i had killed the strange beast of the unfathomed cave was or had at one time been a man,1
i have an exposition of sleep come upon meshakespearei have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams and of the obscure world to which they belong whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiencesfreud to the contrary with his puerile symbolismthere are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier from my experience i cannot doubt but that man when lost to terrestrial consciousness is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much yet prove little we may guess that in dreams life matter and vitality as the earth knows such things are not necessarily constant and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenonit was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that i arose one afternoon in the winter of 19001901 when to the state psychopathic institution in which i served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly his name as given on the records was joe slater or slaader and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the catskill mountain region one of those strange repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a littletravelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts among these odd folk who correspond exactly to the decadent element of white trash in the south law and morals are nonexistent and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of the native american peoplejoe slater who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state policemen and who was described as a highly dangerous character certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when first i beheld him though well above the middle stature and of somewhat brawny frame he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes the scantiness of his neglected and nevershaven growth of yellow beard and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip his age was unknown since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist but from the baldness of his head in front and from the decayed condition of his teeth the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about fortyfrom the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case this man a vagabond hunter and trapper had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates he had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace not that his form of language was at all unusual for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness that none might listen without apprehension he himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said or at least all that had caused him to say what he did relapsing into a bovine halfamiable normality like that of the other hilldwellersas slater grew older it appeared his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities one day near noon after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon the man had roused himself most suddenly with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabina filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself rushing out into the snow he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air the while shouting his determination to reach some big big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor and the loud queer music far away as two men of moderate size sought to restrain him he had struggled with maniacal force and fury screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain thing that shines and shakes and laughs at length after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness shrieking fiendishly that he would jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him family and neighbours had now fled in a panic and when the more courageous of them returned slater was gone leaving behind an unrecognisable pulplike thing that had been a living man but an hour before none of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ravine they realised that he had somehow managed to survive and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary then had followed an armed searching party whose purpose whatever it may have been originally became that of a sheriffs posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed then questioned and finally joined the seekerson the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree and taken to the nearest gaol where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned to them he told a simple story he had he said gone to sleep one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor he had awaked to find himself standing bloodyhanded in the snow before his cabin the mangled corpse of his neighbour peter slader at his feet horrified he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime beyond these things he seemed to know nothing nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact that night slater slept quietly and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression dr barnard who had been watching the patient thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening as if of intelligent determination but when questioned slater relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer and only reiterated what he had said on the preceding dayon the third morning occurred the first of the mans mental attacks after some show of uneasiness in sleep he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a straitjacket the alienists listened with keen attention to his words since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbours slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes babbling in his backwoods dialect of great edifices of light oceans of space strange music and shadowy mountains and valleys but most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him this vast vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire in order to reach it he said he would soar through abysses of emptinessburningevery obstacle that stood in his way thus ran his discourse until with the greatest suddenness he ceased the fire of madness died from his eyes and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound dr barnard unbuckled the leathern harness and did not restore it till night when he succeeded in persuading slater to don it of his own volition for his own good the man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queerly though he knew not whywithin a week two more attacks appeared but from them the doctors learned little on thesourceof slaters visions they speculated at length for since he could neither read nor write and had apparently never heard a legend or fairy tale his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable that it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner he raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret things which he claimed to have experienced but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration the alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man with due formality slater was tried for murder acquitted on the ground of insanity and committed to the institution wherein i held so humble a posti have said that i am a constant speculator concerning dream life and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which i applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as i had fully ascertained the facts of his case he seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me born no doubt of the interest i could not conceal and the gentle manner in which i questioned him not that he ever recognised me during his attacks when i hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic wordpictures but he knew me in his quiet hours when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never enjoy again his family never called to see him probably it had found another temporary head after the manner of decadent mountain folkby degrees i commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of joe slater the man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike but his glowing titanic visions though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive how i often asked myself could the stolid imagination of a catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius how could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which slater ranted in his furious delirium more and more i inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleaguesand yet i could extract nothing definite from the man the sum of all my investigation was that in a kind of semiuncorporeal dream life slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys meadows gardens cities and palaces of light in a region unbounded and unknown to man that there he was no peasant or degenerate but a creature of importance and vivid life moving proudly and dominantly and checked only by a certain deadly enemy who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure and who did not appear to be of human shape since slater never referred to it as amanor as aught save athingthisthinghad done slater some hideous but unnamed wrong which the maniac if maniac he were yearned to avenge from the manner in which slater alluded to their dealings i judged that he and the luminousthinghad met on equal terms that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminousthingof the same race as his enemy this impression was sustained by his frequent references toflying through spaceandburningall that impeded his progress yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dreamworld indeed existed oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought could it be that the dreamsoul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter could it be that i was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if i could but learn to discover and read them i did not tell the older physicians of these things for middle age is sceptical cynical and disinclined to accept new ideas besides the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that i was overworking that my mind needed a restit had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat light and electricity this belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus and i had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude preradio period these i had tested with a fellowstudent but achieving no result had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use now in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of joe slater i sought these instruments again and spent several days in repairing them for action when they were complete once more i missed no opportunity for their trial at each outburst of slaters violence i would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wavelengths of intellectual energy i had but little notion of how the thoughtimpressions would if successfully conveyed arouse an intelligent response in my brain but i felt certain that i could detect and interpret them accordingly i continued my experiments though informing no one of their natureit was on the twentyfirst of february 1901 that the thing finally occurred as i look back across the years i realise how unreal it seems and sometimes half wonder if old dr fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination i recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when i told him but afterward gave me a nervepowder and arranged for the halfyears vacation on which i departed the next week that fateful night i was wildly agitated and perturbed for despite the excellent care he had received joe slater was unmistakably dying perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body he was drowsy near the end and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep i did not strap on the straitjacket as was customary when he slept since i saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away but i did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic radio hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dreamworld in the brief time remaining in the cell with us was one nurse a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus or think to inquire into my course as the hours wore on i saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep but i did not disturb him i myself lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man must have nodded a little laterthe sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me chords vibrations and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty walls columns and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where i seemed to float in air extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour blending with this display of palatial magnificence or rather supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys high mountains and inviting grottoes covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of yet formed wholly of some glowing ethereal plastic entity which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter as i gazed i perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses for each vista which appeared to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger for each sight and sound was familiar to me just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before and would be for like eternities to comethen the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me soul to soul with silent and perfect interchange of thought the hour was one of approaching triumph for was not my fellowbeing escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage escaping forever and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres we floated thus for a little time when i perceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us as though some force were recalling me to earthwhere i least wished to go the form near me seemed to feel a change also for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion and itself prepared to quit the scene fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects a few more thoughts were exchanged and i knew that the luminous one and i were being recalled to bondage though for my brother of light it would be the last time the sorry planetshell being wellnigh spent in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinitya welldefined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as i saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly joe slater was indeed awaking though probably for the last time as i looked more closely i saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of colour which had never before been present the lips too seemed unusual being tightly compressed as if by the force of a stronger character than had been slaters the whole face finally began to grow tense and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes i did not arouse the sleeping nurse but readjusted the slightly disarranged headbands of my telepathic radio intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld the man who had been joe slater the catskill decadent was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze and i felt beyond a doubt that i was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high orderat this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it i closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly and was rewarded by the positive knowledge thatmy longsought mental message had come at lasteach transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind and though no actual language was employed my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary englishjoe slater is deadcame the soulpetrifying voice or agency from beyond the wall of sleep my opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious horror but the blue eyes were still calmly gazing and the countenance was still intelligently animated he is better dead for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of cosmic entity his gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments between ethereal life and planet life he was too much of an animal too little a man yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me for the cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet he has been my torment and diurnal prison for fortytwo of your terrestrial years i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep i am your brother of light and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys it is not permitted me to tell your waking earthself of your real self but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travellers in many ages next year i may be dwelling in the dark egypt which you call ancient or in the cruel empire of tsanchan which is to come three thousand years hence you and i have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red arcturus and dwelt in the bodies of the insectphilosophers that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of jupiter how little does the earthself know of life and its extent how little indeed ought it to know for its own tranquillity of the oppressor i cannot speak you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presenceyou who without knowing idly gave to its blinking beacon the name ofalgol the daemonstarit is to meet and conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for aeons held back by bodily encumbrances tonight i go as a nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeancewatch me in the sky close by the daemonstari cannot speak longer for the body of joe slater grows cold and rigid and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as i wish you have been my friend in the cosmos you have been my only friend on this planetthe only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form which lies on this couch we shall meet againperhaps in the shining mists of orions sword perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric asia perhaps in unremembered dreams tonight perhaps in some other form an aeon hence when the solar system shall have been swept awayat this point the thoughtwaves abruptly ceased and the pale eyes of the dreameror can i say dead mancommenced to glaze fishily in a halfstupor i crossed over to the couch and felt of his wrist but found it cold stiff and pulseless the sallow cheeks paled again and the thick lips fell open disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate joe slater i shivered pulled a blanket over the hideous face and awakened the nurse then i left the cell and went silently to my room i had an insistent and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams i should not rememberthe climax what plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect i have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts allowing you to construe them as you will as i have already admitted my superior old dr fenton denies the reality of everything i have related he vows that i was broken down with nervous strain and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me he assures me on his professional honour that joe slater was but a lowgrade paranoiac whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folktales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities all this he tells meyet i cannot forget what i saw in the sky on the night after slater died lest you think me a biassed witness anothers pen must add this final testimony which may perhaps supply the climax you expect i will quote the following account of the starnova perseiverbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority prof garrett p servisson february 22 1901 a marvellous new star was discovered by dr anderson of edinburghnot very far from algolno star had been visible at that point before within twentyfour hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella in a week or two it had visibly faded and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye,1
my memories are very confused there is even much doubt as to where they begin for at times i feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me while at other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey formless infinity i am not even certain how i am communicating this message while i know i am speaking i have a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what i say to the points where i wish to be heard my identity too is bewilderingly cloudy i seem to have suffered a great shockperhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique incredible experiencethese cycles of experience of course all stem from that wormriddled book i remember when i found itin a dimly lighted place near the black oily river where the mists always swirl that place was very old and the ceilinghigh shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves there were besides great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins and it was in one of these heaps that i found the thing i never learned its title for the early pages were missing but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reelingthere was a formulaa sort of list of things to say and dowhich i recognised as something black and forbidden something which i had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universes guarded secrets whose decaying texts i loved to absorb it was a keya guideto certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it but this book was very old indeed no printingpress but the hand of some halfcrazed monk had traced these ominous latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquityi remember how the old man leered and tittered and made a curious sign with his hand when i bore it away he had refused to take pay for it and only long afterward did i guess why as i hurried home through those narrow winding mistchoked waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet the centuried tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignityas if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened i felt that those walls and overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungous plaster and timberwith fishy eyelike diamondpaned windows that leeredcould hardly desist from advancing and crushing me yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it awayi remember how i read the book at lastwhitefaced and locked in the attic room that i had long devoted to strange searchings the great house was very still for i had not gone up till after midnight i think i had a family thenthough the details are very uncertainand i know there were many servants just what the year was i cannot say for since then i have known many ages and dimensions and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned it was by the light of candles that i readi recall the relentless dripping of the waxand there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries i seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness as if i feared to hear some very remote intruding note among themthen came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city it came as i droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay and i knew amidst my shudders what it meant for he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow and never again can he be alone i had evokedand the book was indeed all i had suspected that night i passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision and when morning found me in the attic room i saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which i had never seen beforenor could i ever after see the world as i had known it mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future and every oncefamiliar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight from then on i walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and halfknown shapes and with each new gateway crossed the less plainly could i recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which i had so long been bound what i saw about me none else saw and i grew doubly silent and aloof lest i be thought mad dogs had a fear of me for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side but still i read morein hidden forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led meand pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and lifepatterns toward the core of the unknown cosmosi remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought the walls melted away and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needlelike pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me after a while there was utter blackness and then the light of myriad stars forming strange alien constellations finally i saw a greenlitten plain far below me and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion i had ever known or read of or dreamed of as i floated closer to that city i saw a great square building of stone in an open space and felt a hideous fear clutching at me i screamed and struggled and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor in that nights wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former nights wandering but there was more of terror because i knew i was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than i had ever been before thereafter i was more cautious with my incantations for i had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence i could never return,1

mythical beings of all sorts and kinds algernon blackwoodithe horror in claythe most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark agetheosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents they have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism but it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when i think of it and maddens me when i dream of it that glimpse like all dread glimpses of truth flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated thingsin this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor i hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out certainly if i live i shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain i think that the professor too intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized himmy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 192627 with the death of my granduncle george gammell angell professor emeritus of semitic languages in brown university providence rhode island professor angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums so that his passing at the age of ninetytwo may be recalled by many locally interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat falling suddenly as witnesses said after having been jostled by a nauticallooking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceaseds home in williams street physicians were unable to find any visible disorder but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man was responsible for the end at the time i saw no reason to dissent from this dictum but latterly i am inclined to wonderand more than wonderas my granduncles heir and executor for he died a childless widower i was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in boston much of the material which i correlated will be later published by the american archaeological society but there was one box which i found exceedingly puzzling and which i felt much averse from shewing to other eyes it had been locked and i did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket then indeed i succeeded in opening it but when i did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier for what could be the meaning of the queer clay basrelief and the disjointed jottings ramblings and cuttings which i found had my uncle in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures i resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old mans peace of mindthe basrelief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area obviously of modern origin its designs however were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing and writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be though my memory despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle failed in any way to identify this particular species or even to hint at its remotest affiliationsabove these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature it seemed to be a sort of monster or symbol representing a monster of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive if i say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus a dragon and a human caricature i shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing a pulpy tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings but it was thegeneral outlineof the whole which made it most shockingly frightful behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a cyclopean architectural backgroundthe writing accompanying this oddity was aside from a stack of press cuttings in professor angells most recent hand and made no pretence to literary style what seemed to be the main document was headed cthulhu cult in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheardof the manuscript was divided into two sections the first of which was headed 1925dream and dream work of h a wilcox 7 thomas st providence ri and the second narrative of inspector john r legrasse 121 bienville st new orleans la at 1908 a a s mtgnotes on same prof webbs acct the other manuscript papers were all brief notes some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines notably w scottelliotsatlantis and the lost lemuria and the rest comments on longsurviving secret societies and hidden cults with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological sourcebooks as frazersgolden boughand miss murrayswitchcult in western europethe cuttings largely alluded to outr mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925the first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale it appears that on march 1st 1925 a thin dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon professor angell bearing the singular clay basrelief which was then exceedingly damp and fresh his card bore the name of henry anthony wilcox and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him who had latterly been studying sculpture at the rhode island school of design and living alone at the fleurdelys building near that institution wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating he called himself psychically hypersensitive but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely queer never mingling much with his kind he had dropped gradually from social visibility and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns even the providence art club anxious to preserve its conservatism had found him quite hopelesson the occasion of the visit ran the professors manuscript the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his hosts archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the basrelief he spoke in a dreamy stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology young wilcoxs rejoinder which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation and which i have since found highly characteristic of him he said it is new indeed for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities and dreams are older than brooding tyre or the contemplative sphinx or gardengirdled babylonit was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle there had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before the most considerable felt in new england for some years and wilcoxs imagination had been keenly affected upon retiring he had had an unprecedented dream of great cyclopean cities of titan blocks and skyflung monoliths all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters cthulhu fhtagnthis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell he questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness and studied with almost frantic intensity the basrelief on which the youth had found himself working chilled and clad only in his nightclothes when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him my uncle blamed his old age wilcox afterward said for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design many of his questions seemed highly outofplace to his visitor especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body when professor angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams this bore regular fruit for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical senseimpacts uninscribable save as gibberish the two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters cthulhu and rlyehon march 23d the manuscript continued wilcox failed to appear and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in waterman street he had cried out in the night arousing several other artists in the building and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium my uncle at once telephoned the family and from that time forward kept close watch of the case calling often at the thayer street office of dr tobey whom he learned to be in charge the youths febrile mind apparently was dwelling on strange things and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them they included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed but touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered about he at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words as repeated by dr tobey convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dreamsculpture reference to this object the doctor added was invariably a prelude to the young mans subsidence into lethargy his temperature oddly enough was not greatly above normal but his whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorderon april 2nd at about 3 pm every trace of wilcoxs malady suddenly ceased he sat upright in bed astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of march 22nd pronounced well by his physician he returned to his quarters in three days but to professor angell he was of no further assistance all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery and my uncle kept no record of his nightthoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visionshere the first part of the manuscript ended but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thoughtso much in fact that only the ingrained scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist the notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young wilcox had had his strange visitations my uncle it seems had quickly instituted a prodigiously farflung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence asking for nightly reports of their dreams and the dates of any notable visions for some time past the reception of his request seems to have been varied but he must at the very least have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary this original correspondence was not preserved but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest average people in society and businessnew englands traditional salt of the earthgave an almost completely negative result though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there always between march 23d and april 2ndthe period of young wilcoxs delirium scientific men were little more affected though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormalit was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came and i know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes as it was lacking their original letters i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see that is why i continued to feel that wilcox somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed had been imposing on the veteran scientist these responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale from february 28th to april 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptors delirium over a fourth of those who reported anything reported scenes and halfsounds not unlike those which wilcox had described and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last one case which the note describes with emphasis was very sad the subject a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism went violently insane on the date of young wilcoxs seizure and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number i should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation but as it was i succeeded in tracing down only a few all of these however bore out the notes in full i have often wondered if all the objects of the professors questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction it is well that no explanation shall ever reach themthe press cuttings as i have intimated touched on cases of panic mania and eccentricity during the given period professor angell must have employed a cutting bureau for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe here was a nocturnal suicide in london where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in south america where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen a despatch from california describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some glorious fulfilment which never arrives whilst items from india speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of march voodoo orgies multiply in hayti and african outposts report ominous mutterings american officers in the philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time and new york policemen are mobbed by hysterical levantines on the night of march 2223 the west of ireland too is full of wild rumour and legendry and a fantastic painter named ardoisbonnot hangs a blasphemous dream landscape in the paris spring salon of 1926 and so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions a weird bunch of cuttings all told and i can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which i set them aside but i was then convinced that young wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professoriithe tale of inspector legrassethe older matters which had made the sculptors dream and basrelief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript once before it appears professor angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as cthulhu and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young wilcox with queries and demands for datathe earlier experience had come in 1908 seventeen years before when the american archaeological society held its annual meeting in st louis professor angell as befitted one of his authority and attainments had had a prominent part in all the deliberations and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solutionthe chief of these outsiders and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting was a commonplacelooking middleaged man who had travelled all the way from new orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source his name was john raymond legrasse and he was by profession an inspector of police with him he bore the subject of his visit a grotesque repulsive and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine it must not be fancied that inspector legrasse had the least interest in archaeology on the contrary his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations the statuette idol fetish or whatever it was had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of new orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the african voodoo circles of its origin apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members absolutely nothing was to be discovered hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol and through it track down the cult to its fountainheadinspector legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created one sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stonethe figure which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study was between seven and eight inches in height and of exquisitely artistic workmanship it represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline but with an octopuslike head whose face was a mass of feelers a scaly rubberylooking body prodigious claws on hind and fore feet and long narrow wings behind this thing which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy was of a somewhat bloated corpulence and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters the tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block the seat occupied the centre whilst the long curved claws of the doubledup crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal the cephalopod head was bent forward so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the crouchers elevated knees the aspect of the whole was abnormally lifelike and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown its vast awesome and incalculable age was unmistakable yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisations youthor indeed to any other time totally separate and apart its very material was a mystery for the soapy greenishblack stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy the characters along the base were equally baffling and no member present despite a representation of half the worlds expert learning in this field could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship they like the subject and material belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no partand yet as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspectors problem there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew this person was the late william channing webb professor of anthropology in princeton university and an explorer of no slight note professor webb had been engaged fortyeight years before in a tour of greenland and iceland in search of some runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth and whilst high up on the west greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate esquimaux whose religion a curious form of devilworship chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness it was a faith of which other esquimaux knew little and which they mentioned only with shudders saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil ortornasukand of this professor webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an agedangekokor wizardpriest expressing the sounds in roman letters as best he knew how but just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs it was the professor stated a very crude basrelief of stone comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing and so far as he could tell it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meetingthis data received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members proved doubly exciting to inspector legrasse and he began at once to ply his informant with questions having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cultworshippers his men had arrested he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist esquimaux there then followed an exhaustive comparison of details and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart what in substance both the esquimau wizards and the louisiana swamppriests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like thisthe worddivisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloudphnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagnlegrasse had one point in advance of professor webb for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant this text as given ran something like thisin his house at rlyeh dead cthulhu waits dreamingand now in response to a general and urgent demand inspector legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers telling a story to which i could see my uncle attached profound significance it savoured of the wildest dreams of mythmaker and theosophist and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such halfcastes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess iton november 1st 1907 there had come to the new orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south the squatters there mostly primitive but goodnatured descendants of lafittes men were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night it was voodoo apparently but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tomtom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured there were insane shouts and harrowing screams soulchilling chants and dancing devilflames and the frightened messenger added the people could stand it no moreso a body of twenty police filling two carriages and an automobile had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide at the end of the passable road they alighted and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of spanish moss beset them and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create at length the squatter settlement a miserable huddle of huts hove in sight and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns the muffled beat of tomtoms was now faintly audible far far ahead and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted a reddish glare too seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night reluctant even to be left alone again each one of the cowed squatters refused pointblank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship so inspector legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod beforethe region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute substantially unknown and untraversed by white men there were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight in which dwelt a huge formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes and squatters whispered that batwinged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight they said it had been there before diberville before la salle before the indians and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods it was nightmare itself and to see it was to die but it made men dream and so they knew enough to keep away the present voodoo orgy was indeed on the merest fringe of this abhorred area but that location was bad enough hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidentsonly poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by legrasses men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tomtoms there are vocal qualities peculiar to men and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other animal fury and orgiastic licence here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell now and then the less organised ululation would cease and from what seemed a welldrilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in singsong chant that hideous phrase or ritualphnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagnthen the men having reached a spot where the trees were thinner came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself four of them reeled one fainted and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horrorin a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acres extent clear of trees and tolerably dry on this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a sime or an angarola could paint void of clothing this hybrid spawn were braying bellowing and writhing about a monstrous ringshaped bonfire in the centre of which revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height on top of which incongruous with its diminutiveness rested the noxious carven statuette from a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flamegirt monolith as a centre hung head downward the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared it was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fireit may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men an excitable spaniard to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror this man joseph d galvez i later met and questioned and he proved distractingly imaginative he indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest treesbut i suppose he had been hearing too much native superstitionactually the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration duty came first and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout for five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description wild blows were struck shots were fired and escapes were made but in the end legrasse was able to count some fortyseven sullen prisoners whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen five of the worshippers lay dead and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellowprisoners the image on the monolith of course was carefully removed and carried back by legrasseexamined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low mixedblooded and mentally aberrant type most were seamen and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes largely west indians or brava portuguese from the cape verde islands gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult but before many questions were asked it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro fetichism was involved degraded and ignorant as they were the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faiththey worshipped so they said the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men and who came to the young world out of the sky those old ones were gone now inside the earth and under the sea but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men who formed a cult which had never died this was that cult and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu from his dark house in the mighty city of rlyeh under the waters should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway some day he would call when the stars were ready and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate himmeanwhile no more must be told there was a secret which even torture could not extract mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few but these were not the great old ones no man had ever seen the old ones the carven idol was great cthulhu but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him no one could read the old writing now but things were told by word of mouth the chanted ritual was not the secretthat was never spoken aloud only whispered the chant meant only this in his house at rlyeh dead cthulhu waits dreamingonly two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged and the rest were committed to various institutions all denied a part in the ritual murders and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial meetingplace in the haunted wood but of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained what the police did extract came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named castro who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of chinaold castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed there had been aeons when other things ruled on the earth and they had had great cities remains of them he said the deathless chinamen had told him were still to be found as cyclopean stones on islands in the pacific they all died vast epochs of time before men came but there were arts which could revive them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity they had indeed come themselves from the stars and brought their images with themthese great old ones castro continued were not composed altogether of flesh and blood they had shapefor did not this starfashioned image prove itbut that shape was not made of matter when the stars were right they could plunge from world to world through the sky but when the stars were wrong they could not live but although they no longer lived they would never really die they all lay in stone houses in their great city of rlyeh preserved by the spells of mighty cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for them but at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate their bodies the spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented them from making an initial move and they could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by they knew all that was occurring in the universe but their mode of speech was transmitted thought even now they talked in their tombs when after infinities of chaos the first men came the great old ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams for only thus could their language reach the fleshly minds of mammalsthen whispered castro those first men formed the cult around small idols which the great ones shewed them idols brought in dim aeras from dark stars that cult would never die till the stars came right again and the secret priests would take great cthulhu from his tomb to revive his subjects and resume his rule of earth the time would be easy to know for then mankind would have become as the great old ones free and wild and beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy then the liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom meanwhile the cult by appropriate rites must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their returnin the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed old ones in dreams but then something had happened the great stone city rlyeh with its monoliths and sepulchres had sunk beneath the waves and the deep waters full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass had cut off the spectral intercourse but memory never died and highpriests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth mouldy and shadowy and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten seabottoms but of them old castro dared not speak much he cut himself off hurriedly and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction thesizeof the old ones too he curiously declined to mention of the cult he said that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless deserts of arabia where irem the city of pillars dreams hidden and untouched it was not allied to the european witchcult and was virtually unknown beyond its members no book had ever really hinted of it though the deathless chinamen said that there were double meanings in thenecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose especially the muchdiscussed coupletthat is not dead which can eternal lieand with strange aeons even death may dielegrasse deeply impressed and not a little bewildered had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult castro apparently had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret the authorities at tulane university could shed no light upon either cult or image and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the greenland tale of professor webbthe feverish interest aroused at the meeting by legrasses tale corroborated as it was by the statuette is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture legrasse for some time lent the image to professor webb but at the latters death it was returned to him and remains in his possession where i viewed it not long ago it is truly a terrible thing and unmistakably akin to the dreamsculpture of young wilcoxthat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor i did not wonder for what thoughts must arise upon hearing after a knowledge of what legrasse had learned of the cult of a sensitive young man who haddreamednot only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swampfound image and the greenland devil tablet but had comein his dreamsupon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by esquimau diabolists and mongrel louisianans professor angells instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural though privately i suspected young wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncles expense the dreamnarratives and cuttings collected by the professor were of course strong corroboration but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what i thought the most sensible conclusions so after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of legrasse i made a trip to providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke i thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged manwilcox still lived alone in the fleurdelys building in thomas street a hideous victorian imitation of seventeenthcentury breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill and under the very shadow of the finest georgian steeple in america i found him at work in his rooms and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic he will i believe some time be heard from as one of the great decadents for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in paintingdark frail and somewhat unkempt in aspect he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising when i told him who i was he displayed some interest for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams yet had never explained the reason for the study i did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard but sought with some subtlety to draw him out in a short time i became convinced of his absolute sincerity for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake they and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion he could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream basrelief but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands it was no doubt the giant shape he had raved of in delirium that he really knew nothing of the hidden cult save from what my uncles relentless catechism had let fall he soon made clear and again i strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressionshe talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion making me see with terrible vividness the damp cyclopean city of slimy green stonewhosegeometryhe oddly said wasall wrongand hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless halfmental calling from underground cthulhu fhtagn cthulhu fhtagn these words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead cthulhus dreamvigil in his stone vault at rlyeh and i felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs wilcox i was sure had heard of the cult in some casual way and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining later by virtue of its sheer impressiveness it had found subconscious expression in dreams in the basrelief and in the terrible statue i now beheld so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one the youth was of a type at once slightly affected and slightly illmannered which i could never like but i was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty i took leave of him amicably and wish him all the success his talent promisesthe matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions i visited new orleans talked with legrasse and others of that oldtime raidingparty saw the frightful image and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived old castro unfortunately had been dead for some years what i now heard so graphically at firsthand though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written excited me afresh for i felt sure that i was on the track of a very real very secret and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note my attitude was still one of absolute materialismas i wish it still wereand i discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by professor angellone thing i began to suspect and which i now fear iknowis that my uncles death was far from natural he fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels after a careless push from a negro sailor i did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cultmembers in louisiana and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and poison needles as ruthless and as anciently known as the cryptic rites and beliefs legrasse and his men it is true have been let alone but in norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptors data have come to sinister ears i think professor angell died because he knew too much or because he was likely to learn too much whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen for i have learned much nowiiithe madness from the seaif heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelfpaper it was nothing on which i would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round for it was an old number of an australian journal thesydney bulletinfor april 18 1925 it had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncles researchi had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the cthulhu cult and was visiting a learned friend in paterson new jersey the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones it was thesydney bulletini have mentioned for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts and the picture was a halftone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which legrasse had found in the swampeagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents i scanned the item in detail and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length what it suggested however was of portentous significance to my flagging quest and i carefully tore it out for immediate action it read as followsmystery derelict found at seavigilant arrives with helpless armed new zealand yacht in towone survivor and dead man found aboard tale ofdesperate

complete bafflement and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht in a small carved shrine of common patternthis man after recovering his senses told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter he is gustaf johansen a norwegian of some intelligence and had been second mate of the twomasted schooneremmaof auckland which sailed for callao february 20th with a complement of eleven men theemmahe says was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of march 1st and on march 22nd in s latitude 49 51 w longitude 128 34 encountered thealertmanned by a queer and evillooking crew of kanakas and halfcastes being ordered peremptorily to turn back capt collins refused whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yachts equipment theemmasmen shewed fight says the survivor and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her grappling with the savage crew on the yachts deck and being forced to kill them all the number being slightly superior because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fightingthree of theemmasmen including capt collins and first mate green were killed and the remaining eight under second mate johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed the next day it appears they raised and landed on a small island although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean and six of the men somehow died ashore though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm later it seems he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her but were beaten about by the storm of april 2nd from that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little and he does not even recall when william briden his companion died bridens death reveals no apparent cause and was probably due to excitement or exposure cable advices from dunedin report that thealertwas well known there as an island trader and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront it was owned by a curious group of halfcastes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of march 1st our auckland correspondent gives theemmaand her crew an excellent reputation and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man the admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow at which every effort will be made to induce johansen to speak more freely than he has done hithertothis was all together with the picture of the hellish image but what a train of ideas it started in my mind here were new treasuries of data on the cthulhu cult and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land what motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back theemmaas they sailed about with their hideous idol what was the unknown island on which six of theemmascrew had died and about which the mate johansen was so secretive what had the viceadmiraltys investigation brought out and what was known of the noxious cult in dunedin and most marvellous of all what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my unclemarch 1stour february 28th according to the international date linethe earthquake and storm had come from dunedin thealertand her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange dank cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded cthulhu march 23d the crew of theemmalanded on an unknown island and left six men dead and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monsters malign pursuit whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium and what of this storm of april 2ndthe date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased and wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever what of all thisand of those hints of old castro about the sunken starborn old ones and their coming reign their faithful cultand their mastery of dreamswas i tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond mans power to bear if so they must be horrors of the mind alone for in some way the second of april had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankinds soulthat evening after a day of hurried cabling and arranging i bade my host adieu and took a train for san francisco in less than a month i was in dunedin where however i found that little was known of the strange cultmembers who had lingered in the old seataverns waterfront scum was far too common for special mention though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills in auckland i learned that johansen had returnedwith yellow hair turned whiteafter a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials and all they could do was to give me his oslo addressafter that i went to sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the viceadmiralty court i saw thealertnow sold and in commercial use at circular quay in sydney cove but gained nothing from its noncommittal bulk the crouching image with its cuttlefish head dragon body scaly wings and hieroglyphed pedestal was preserved in the museum at hyde park and i studied it long and well finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship and with the same utter mystery terrible antiquity and unearthly strangeness of material which i had noted in legrasses smaller specimen geologists the curator told me had found it a monstrous puzzle for they vowed that the world held no rock like it then i thought with a shudder of what old castro had told legrasse about the primal great ones they had come from the stars and had brought their images with themshaken with such a mental revolution as i had never before known i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo sailing for london i rembarked at once for the norwegian capital and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the egeberg johansens address i discovered lay in the old town of king harold haardrada which kept alive the name of oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as christiana i made the brief trip by taxicab and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front a sadfaced woman in black answered my summons and i was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting english that gustaf johansen was no morehe had not survived his return said his wife for the doings at sea in 1925 had broken him he had told her no more than he had told the public but had left a long manuscriptof technical matters as he saidwritten in english evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal during a walk through a narrow lane near the gothenburg dock a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down two lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead physicians found no adequate cause for the end and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitutioni now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till i too am at rest accidentally or otherwise persuading the widow that my connexion with her husbands technical matters was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript i bore the document away and began to read it on the london boat it was a simple rambling thinga naive sailors effort at a postfacto diaryand strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage i cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance but i will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessels sides became so unendurable to me that i stopped my ears with cottonjohansen thank god did not know quite all even though he saw the city and the thing but i shall never sleep calmly again when i think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and airjohansens voyage had begun just as he told it to the viceadmiralty theemmain ballast had cleared auckland on february 20th and had felt the full force of that earthquakeborn tempest which must have heaved up from the seabottom the horrors that filled mens dreams once more under control the ship was making good progress when held up by thealerton march 22nd and i could feel the mates regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking of the swarthy cultfiends on thealerthe speaks with significant horror there was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty and johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry then driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under johansens command the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea and in s latitude 47 9 w longitude 126 43 come upon a coastline of mingled mud ooze and weedy cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earths supreme terrorthe nightmare corpsecity of rlyeh that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars there lay great cthulhu and his hordes hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last after cycles incalculable the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration all this johansen did not suspect but god knows he soon saw enoughi suppose that only a single mountaintop the hideous monolithcrowned citadel whereon great cthulhu was buried actually emerged from the waters when i think of theextentof all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping babylon of elder daemons and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and basreliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on thealertis poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened descriptionwithout knowing what futurism is like johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city for instead of describing any definite structure or building he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfacessurfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs i mention his talk aboutanglesbecause it suggests something wilcox had told me of his awful dreams he had said that thegeometryof the dreamplace he saw was abnormal noneuclidean and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible realityjohansen and his men landed at a sloping mudbank on this monstrous acropolis and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase the very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this seasoaked perversion and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed convexitysomething very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others and it was only halfheartedly that they searchedvainly as it provedfor some portable souvenir to bear awayit was rodriguez the portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found the rest followed him and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squiddragon basrelief it was johansen said like a great barndoor and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel threshold and jambs around it though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trapdoor or slantwise like an outside cellardoor as wilcox would have said the geometry of the place was all wrong one could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variablebriden pushed at the stone in several places without result then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge pressing each point separately as he went he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone mouldingthat is one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontaland the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast then very softly and slowly the acregreat panel began to give inward at the top and they saw that it was balanced donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal in this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upsetthe aperture was black with a darkness almost material that tenebrousness was indeed apositive qualityfor it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeonlong imprisonment visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings the odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable and at length the quickeared hawkins thought he heard a nasty slopping sound down there everyone listened and everyone was listening still when it lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madnesspoor johansens handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this of the six men who never reached the ship he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant the thing cannot be describedthere is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy such eldritch contradictions of all matter force and cosmic order a mountain walked or stumbled god what wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad and poor wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant the thing of the idols the green sticky spawn of the stars had awaked to claim his own the stars were right again and what an ageold cult had failed to do by design a band of innocent sailors had done by accident after vigintillions of years great cthulhu was loose again and ravening for delightthree men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned god rest them if there be any rest in the universe they were donovan guerrera and ngstrom parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of greencrusted rock to the boat and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldnt have been there an angle which was acute but behaved as if it were obtuse so only briden and johansen reached the boat and pulled desperately for thealertas the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the watersteam had not been suffered to go down entirely despite the departure of all hands for the shore and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get thealertunder way slowly amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene she began to churn the lethal waters whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus then bolder than the storied cyclops great cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast waveraising strokes of cosmic potency briden looked back and went mad laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriouslybut johansen had not given out yet knowing that the thing could surely overtake thealertuntil steam was fully up he resolved on a desperate chance and setting the engine for full speed ran lightninglike on deck and reversed the wheel there was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon the awful squidhead with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht but johansen drove on relentlessly there was a bursting as of an exploding bladder a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish a stench as of a thousand opened graves and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper for an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud and then there was only a venomous seething astern wheregod in heaventhe scattered plasticity of that nameless skyspawn was nebulouslyrecombiningin its hateful original form whilst its distance widened every second as thealertgained impetus from its mounting steamthat was all after that johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side he did not try to navigate after the first bold flight for the reaction had taken something out of his soul then came the storm of april 2nd and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness there is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted hilarious elder gods and the green batwinged mocking imps of tartarusout of that dream came rescuethevigilantthe viceadmiralty court the streets of dunedin and the long voyage back home to the old house by the egeberg he could not tellthey would think him mad he would write of what he knew before death came but his wife must not guess death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memoriesthat was the document i read and now i have placed it in the tin box beside the basrelief and the papers of professor angell with it shall go this record of minethis test of my own sanity wherein is pieced together that which i hope may never be pieced together again i have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me but i do not think my life will be long as my uncle went as poor johansen went so i shall go i know too much and the cult still livescthulhu still lives too i suppose again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young his accursed city is sunken once more for thevigilantsailed over the spot after the april storm but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idolcapped monoliths in lonely places he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy who knows the end what has risen may sink and what has sunk may rise loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men a time will comebut i must not and cannot think let me pray that if i do not survive this manuscript my executors may put caution before

been incineratedborellusi a result and a prologue1from a private hospital for the insane near providence rhode island there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person he bore the name of charles dexter ward and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological characterin the first place the patient seemed oddly older than his twentysix years would warrant mental disturbance it is true will age one rapidly but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire in the second place his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry the voice was lost so that no sounds above a whisper were possible digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded either normal or pathological the skin had a morbid chill and dryness and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before in general all physicians agree that in ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedentpsychologically too charles ward was unique his madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms dr willett who was wards family physician affirms that the patients gross mental capacity as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity had actually increased since the seizure ward it is true was always a scholar and an antiquarian but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists it was indeed a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem and only on the evidence of others and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence was he finally placed in confinement to the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted and shrewd observers failing to foresee his escape freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custodyonly dr willett who brought charles ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom he had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues willett indeed presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case he was the last to see the patient before his flight and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when wards escape became known three hours later that escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of dr waites hospital a window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it yet after that talk with willett the youth was undeniably gone willett himself has no public explanations to offer though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape many indeed feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him he had found ward in his room but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain when they opened the door the patient was not there and all they found was the open window with a chill april breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluishgrey dust that almost choked them true the dogs howled some time before but that was while willett was still present and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on wards father was told at once over the telephone but he seemed more saddened than surprised by the time dr waite called in person dr willett had been talking with him and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape only from certain closely confidential friends of willett and the senior ward have any clues been gained and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence the one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthedcharles ward was an antiquarian from infancy no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in prospect street on the crest of the hill with the years his devotion to ancient things increased so that history genealogy and the study of colonial architecture furniture and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests these tastes are important to remember in considering his madness for although they do not form its absolute nucleus they play a prominent part in its superficial form the gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of autohypnosis the odd thing was that ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well he had it appears lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain that this wholesale deletion had occurred he did his best to hide but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time alienists are now wondering how in view of his vitally impaired range of data the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normalthe beginning of wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists dr lyman the eminent boston authority places it in 1919 or 1920 during the boys last year at the moses brown school when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make this is certainly borne out by wards altered habits at the time especially by his continual search through town records and among old buryinggrounds for a certain grave dug in 1771 the grave of an ancestor named joseph curwen some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in olney court on stampers hill which curwen was known to have built and occupied it is broadly speaking undeniable that the winter of 191920 saw a great change in ward whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers gravefrom this opinion however dr willett substantially dissents basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him so that his voice trembles when he tells them and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them willett admits that the change of 191920 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928 but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made granting freely that the boy was always illbalanced temperamentally and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness crediting instead wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound the true madness he is certain came with a later change after the curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed after a trip to strange foreign places had been made and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances after certainanswersto these invocations had been plainly indicated and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions after the wave of vampirism and the ominous pawtuxet gossip and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticedit was only about this time willett points out with much acuteness that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with ward and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery in the first place two workmen of high intelligence saw joseph curwens ancient papers found secondly the boy once shewed dr willett those papers and a page of the curwen diary and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness the hole where ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality and willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the orne and hutchinson letters and the problem of the curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about dr allen these things and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experienceand most conclusive of all there are the two hideousresultswhich the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge2one must look back at charles wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly in the autumn of 1918 and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period he had begun his junior year at the moses brown school which lies very near his home the old main building erected in 1819 had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape his social activities were few and his hours were spent mainly at home in rambling walks in his classes and drills and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the city hall the state house the public library the athenaeum the historical society the john carter brown and john hay libraries of brown university and the newly opened shepley library in benefit street one may picture him yet as he was in those days tall slim and blond with studious eyes and a slight stoop dressed somewhat carelessly and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractivenesshis walks were always adventures in antiquity during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before his home was a great georgian mansion atop the wellnigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires domes roofs and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond here he was born and from the lovely classic porch of the doublebayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken and on toward the stately colleges along the shady sumptuous street whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow heavycolumned doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardenshe had been wheeled too along sleepy congdon street one tier lower down on the steep hill and with all its eastern homes on high terraces the small wooden houses averaged a greater age here for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village the nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of prospect terrace to chat with policemen and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment all violet and mystic against a fevered apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens the vast marble dome of the state house stood out in massive silhouette its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming skywhen he was larger his famous walks began first with his impatiently dragged nurse and then alone in dreamy meditation farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city he would hesitate gingerly down vertical jenckes street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady benefit street corner where before him was a wooden antique with an ionicpilastered pair of doorways and beside him a prehistoric gambrelroofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining and the great judge durfee house with its fallen vestiges of georgian grandeur it was getting to be a slum here but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the prerevolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals on the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps and the young charles could picture them as they were when the street was new and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visiblewestward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above down to the old town street that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636 here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning huddled houses of immense antiquity and fascinated though he was it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors he found it much less formidable to continue along benefit street past the iron fence of st johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 colony house and the mouldering bulk of the golden ball inn where washington stopped at meeting streetthe successive gaol lane and king street of other periodshe would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope and downward to the west glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient sign of shakespears head where theprovidence gazette and countryjournalwas printed before the revolution then came the exquisite first baptist church of 1775 luxurious with its matchless gibbs steeple and the georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west spectral in their manygabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud east india days amidst polyglot vice and squalor rotting wharves and bleareyed shipchandleries with such surviving alley names as packet bullion gold silver coin doubloon sovereign guilder dollar dime and centsometimes as he grew taller and more adventurous young ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses broken transoms tumbling steps twisted balustrades swarthy faces and nameless odours winding from south main to south water searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched and returning northward at this lower level past the steeproofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the great bridge where the 1773 market house still stands firm on its ancient arches in that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff decked with its two georgian spires and crowned by the vast new christian science dome as london is crowned by st pauls he liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon when the slanting sunlight touches the market house and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where providence indiamen used to ride at anchor after a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in smallpaned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wroughtiron railingsat other times and in later years he would seek for vivid contrasts spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home where the hill drops to the lower eminence of stampers hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the boston stage coach used to start before the revolution and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about george benevolent power and williams streets where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger these rambles together with the diligent studies which accompanied them certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from charles wards mind and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell in that fateful winter of 191920 the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruitiondr willett is certain that up to this illomened winter of first change charles wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid then by insidious degrees there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very longlived man named joseph curwen who had come from salem in march of 1692 and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clusteredwards greatgreatgrandfather welcome potter had in 1785 married a certain ann tillinghast daughter of mrs eliza daughter to capt james tillinghast of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace late in 1918 whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name by which in 1772 a mrs eliza curwen widow of joseph curwen resumed along with her sevenyearold daughter ann her maiden name of tillinghast on the ground that her husbands name was become a publick reproach by reason of what was knowne after his decease the which confirming an antient common rumour tho not to be credited by a loyall wife till so proven as to be wholely past doubting this entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbersit was at once clear to charles ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown greatgreatgreatgrandfather the discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person about whom there remained so few publicly available records aside from those becoming public only in modern times that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory what did appear moreover was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too validbefore this ward had been content to let his romancing about old joseph curwen remain in the idle stage but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently hushedup character he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him in this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations for old letters diaries and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy one important sidelight came from a point as remote as new york where some rhode island colonial correspondence was stored in the museum at fraunces tavern the really crucial thing though and what in dr willetts opinion formed the definite source of wards undoing was the matter found in august 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in olney court it was that beyond a doubt which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pitii an antecedent and a horror1joseph curwen as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what ward heard and unearthed was a very astonishing enigmatic and obscurely horrible individual he had fled from salem to providencethat universal haven of the odd the free and the dissentingat the beginning of the great witchcraft panic being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments he was a colourlesslooking man of about thirty and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of providence thereafter buying a home lot just north of gregory dexters at about the foot of olney street his house was built on stampers hill west of the town street in what later became olney court and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one on the same site which is still standingnow the first odd thing about joseph curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival he engaged in shipping enterprises purchased wharfage near mileend cove helped rebuild the great bridge in 1713 and in 1723 was one of the founders of the congregational church on the hill but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirtyfive as decades mounted up this singular quality began to excite wide notice but curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out how such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night was not very clear to the townsfolk and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity it was held for the most part that curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from london and the indies on his ships or purchased in newport boston and new york and when old dr jabez bowen came from rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the great bridge at the sign of the unicorn and mortar there was ceaseless talk of the drugs acids and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him acting on the assumption that curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a noncommittal way and always gave them oddcoloured potions in response to their requests it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit at length when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique the people began to whisper more darkly and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewnprivate letters and diaries of the period reveal too a multitude of other reasons why joseph curwen was marvelled at feared and finally shunned like a plague his passion for graveyards in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions was notorious though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish on the pawtuxet road he had a farm at which he generally lived during the summer and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night here his only visible servants farmers and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged narragansett indians the husband dumb and curiously scarred and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance probably due to a mixture of negro blood in the leanto of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles bags or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks crucibles alembics and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room and prophesied in whispers that the closemouthed chymistby which they meantalchemistwould not be long in finding the philosophers stone the nearest neighbours to this farmthe fenners a quarter of a mile awayhad still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the curwen place in the night there were cries they said and sustained howlings and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat milk and wool the identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the kingstown farmers then too there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windowsgreat bridge idlers likewise had much to say of curwens town house in olney court not so much the fine new one built in 1761 when the man must have been nearly a century old but the first low gambrelroofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition here there was less mystery it is true but the hours at which lights were seen the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged french housekeeper the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived and thequalityof certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times all combined with what was known of the pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad namein choicer circles too the curwen home was by no means undiscussed for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy his birth was known to be good since the curwens or corwins of salem needed no introduction in new england it developed that joseph curwen had travelled much in very early life living for a time in england and making at least two voyages to the orient and his speech when he deigned to use it was that of a learned and cultivated englishman but for some reason or other curwen did not care for society whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inanethere seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic sardonic arrogance as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities when dr checkley the famous wit came from boston in 1738 to be rector of kings church he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse charles ward told his father when they discussed curwen one winter evening that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric but that all diarists agree concerning dr checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard the good man had been hideously shocked and could never recall joseph curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famedmore definite however was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit in 1746 mr john merritt an elderly english gentleman of literary and scientific leanings came from newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing and built a fine country seat on the neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section he lived in considerable style and comfort keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town and taking great pride in his telescope his microscope and his wellchosen library of english and latin books hearing of curwen as the owner of the best library in providence mr merritt early paid him a call and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been his admiration for his hosts ample shelves which besides the greek latin and english classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical mathematical and scientific works including paracelsus agricola van helmont sylvius glauber boyle boerhaave becher and stahl led curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before and the two drove out at once in mr merritts coachmr merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical alchemical and theological subjects which curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing perhaps however the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice the bizarre collection besides a host of standard works which mr merritt was not too alarmed to envy embraced nearly all the cabbalists daemonologists and magicians known to man and was a treasurehouse of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology hermes trismegistus in mesnards

turned pale when upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as theqanooneislamhe found it was in truth the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of kingsport in the province of the massachusettsbaybut oddly enough the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail on the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of borellus bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in curwens hand the book was open at about its middle and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous penstrokes beneath the lines of mystic blackletter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through whether it was the nature of the passage underscored or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring he could not tell but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly he recalled it to the end of his days writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend dr checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector it readthe essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust a philosopher may without any criminal necromancy call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incineratedit was near the docks along the southerly part of the town street however that the worst things were muttered about joseph curwen sailors are superstitious folk and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum slave and molasses sloops the rakish privateers and the great brigs of the browns crawfords and tillinghasts all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim deceptively younglooking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the curwen warehouse in doubloon street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the curwen ships rode restlessly curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him and all his sailors were mongrel riffraff from martinique st eustatius havana or port royal it was in a way the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held a crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men that many of the errands had concerned the farm on the pawtuxet road and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place was not forgotten so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the providence wharves and their replacement in the west indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchantin 1760 joseph curwen was virtually an outcast suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named understood or even proved to exist the last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758 for in march and april of that year two royal regiments on their way to new france were quartered in providence and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion rumour dwelt on the frequency with which curwen was wont to be seen talking with the redcoated strangers and as several of them began to be missed people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen what would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on no one can tellmeanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering he had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre black pepper and cinnamon and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the browns in his importation of brassware indigo cotton woollens salt rigging iron paper and english goods of every kind such shopkeepers as james green at the sign of the elephant in cheapside the russells at the sign of the golden eagle across the bridge or clark and nightingale at the fryingpan and fish near the new coffeehouse depended almost wholly upon him for their stock and his arrangements with the local distillers the narragansett dairymen and horsebreeders and the newport candlemakers made him one of the prime exporters of the colonyostracised though he was he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort when the colony house burned down he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick onestill standing at the head of its parade in the old main streetwas built in 1761 in that same year too he helped rebuild the great bridge after the october gale he replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the colony house fire and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy market parade and deeprutted town street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or causey in the middle about this time also he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving when the whitefield adherents broke off from dr cottons hill church in 1743 and founded deacon snows church across the bridge curwen had gone with them though his zeal and attendance soon abated now however he cultivated piety once more as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked2the sight of this strange pallid man hardly middleaged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse was at once a pathetic a dramatic and a contemptible thing such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures however that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased he must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions for he was never again caught at such wanderings whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion his rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high but not until modern times when charles ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the shepley library did it occur to any personsave one embittered youth perhapsto make dark comparisons between the large number of guinea blacks he imported until 1766 and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slavedealers at the great bridge or to the planters of the narragansett country certainly the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon himbut of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer his elaborate studies and experiments whatever they may have been apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of providence so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation transparent excuses of errands elsewhere and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness his clerks being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ were giving him much worry and he held to his seacaptains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over thema mortgage a promissory note or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare in many cases diarists have recorded with some awe curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use during the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the longdead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues endabout this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community hitherto a complete hermit he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible it may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them but of this nothing certain can ever be learned naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure such candidates he found were not at all easy to discover since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty accomplishments and social security at length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest shipcaptains a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named dutee tillinghast whose only daughter eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress capt tillinghast was completely under the domination of curwen and consented after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on powers lane hill to sanction the blasphemous allianceeliza tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted she had attended stephen jacksons school opposite the courthouse parade and had been diligently instructed by her mother before the latters death of smallpox in 1757 in all the arts and refinements of domestic life a sampler of hers worked in 1753 at the age of nine may still be found in the rooms of the rhode island historical society after her mothers death she had kept the house aided only by one old black woman her arguments with her father concerning the proposed curwen marriage must have been painful indeed but of these we have no record certain it is that her engagement to young ezra weeden second mate of the crawford packetenterprisewas dutifully broken off and that her union with joseph curwen took place on the seventh of march 1763 in the baptist church in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast the ceremony being performed by the younger samuel winsor thegazettementioned the event very briefly and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the languagemonday evening last mr joseph curwen of this town merchant was married to miss eliza tillinghast daughter of capt dutee tillinghast a young lady who has real merit added to a beautiful person to grace the connubial state and perpetuate its felicitythe collection of durfeearnold letters discovered by charles ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of melville f peters esq of george st and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this illassorted match the social influence of the tillinghasts however was not to be denied and once more joseph curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold his acceptance was by no means complete and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down in his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration the new house in olney court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations and although curwen was much absent at the pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence only one person remained in open enmity with him this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to eliza tillinghast had been so abruptly broken ezra weeden had frankly vowed vengeance and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition was now gaining a hatebred dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husbandon the seventh of may 1765 curwens only child ann was born and was christened by the rev john graves of kings church of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage in order to compromise between their respective congregational and baptist affiliations the record of this birth as well as that of the marriage two years before was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear and charles ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness the birth entry indeed was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist dr graves who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the revolution ward had tried this source because he knew that his greatgreatgrandmother ann tillinghast potter had been an episcopalianshortly after the birth of his daughter an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness curwen resolved to sit for a portrait this he had painted by a very gifted scotsman named cosmo alexander then a resident of newport and since famous as the early teacher of gilbert stuart the likeness was said to have been executed on a wallpanel of the library of the house in olney court but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition at this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the pawtuxet road he seemed it was stated in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subjecthis affectation of civic interest did not diminish and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as stephen hopkins joseph brown and benjamin west in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town which was then much below the level of newport in its patronage of the liberal arts he had helped daniel jenckes found his bookshop in 1763 and was thereafter his best customer extending aid likewise to the strugglinggazettethat appeared each wednesday at the sign of shakespears head in politics he ardently supported governor hopkins against the ward party whose prime strength was in newport and his really eloquent speech at hackers hall in 1765 against the setting off of north providence as a separate town with a proward vote in the general assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him but ezra weeden who watched him closely sneered cynically at all this outward activity and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of tartarus the revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the curwen warehouses and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay he also kept as close a watch as possible on the pawtuxet farm and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old indian couple loosed upon him3in 1766 came the final change in joseph curwen it was very sudden and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak giving instant place to an illconcealed exaltation of perfect triumph curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing for no explanation was ever offered by him it was after this transition which appears to have come early in july that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their longdead ancestors would seem to be able to impartbut curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change on the contrary they tended rather to increase so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been he altogether abandoned the slave trade alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing every possible moment was spent at the pawtuxet farm though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which though not actually near graveyards were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was ezra weeden though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked and subjected curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had beforemany of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the sugar act which hampered a prominent traffick smuggling and evasion were the rule in narragansett bay and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces but weeden night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the curwen warehouses at the town street docks soon felt assured that it was not merely his majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of pawtuxet being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the curwen farm where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows after that change however the whole programme was altered importation of slaves ceased at once and for a time curwen abandoned his midnight sailings then about the spring of 1767 a new policy appeared once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black silent docks and this time they would go down the bay some distance perhaps as far as namquit point where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore and transport it overland to the farm locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes the cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffinsweeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity visiting it each night for long periods and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprintrevealing snow even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties he hired a tavern companion named eleazar smith to continue the survey during his absences and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours that they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible instead they wished to learn something definite before taking any action what they did learn must have been startling indeed and charles ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at weedens later burning of his notebooks all that can be told of their discoveries is what eleazar smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary and what other diarists and letterwriters have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally madeand according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehensionit is gathered that weeden and smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old indian and his wife underlay the farm the house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamondpaned lattice windows the laboratory being in a leanto toward the north where the roof came nearly to the ground this building stood clear of any other yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath these voices before 1766 were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams coupled with curious chants or invocations after that date however they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest they appeared to be in different languages all known to curwen whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply reproof or threatening sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house curwen certain captives and the guards of those captives there were voices of a sort that neither weeden nor smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality the nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism as if curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisonersweeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook for english french and spanish which he knew were frequently used but of these nothing has survived he did however say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of providence families were concerned most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages once for example an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in french about the black princes massacre at limoges in 1370 as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know curwen asked the prisonerif prisoner it werewhether the order to slay was given because of the sign of the goat found on the altar in the ancient roman crypt beneath the cathedral or whether the dark man of the haute vienne coven had spoken the three words failing to obtain replies the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping soundnone of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed since the windows were always heavily draped once though during a discourse in an unknown tongue a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled weeden exceedingly reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in hackers hall when a man from germantown pennsylvania had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a view of the famous city of jerusalem in which are represented jerusalem the temple of solomon his royal throne the noted towers and hills likewise the sufferings of our saviour from the garden of gethsemane to the cross on the hill of golgotha an artful piece of statuary worthy to be seen by the curious it was on this occasion that the listener who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded gave a start which roused the old indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him after that no more conversations were ever heard in the house and weeden and smith concluded that curwen had transferred his field of action to regions belowthat such regions in truth existed seemed amply clear from many things faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure whilst hidden in the bushes along the riverbank in the rear where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the pawtuxet there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill when or how these catacombs could have been constructed weeden was unable to say but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river joseph curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed during the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep riverbank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm and in a locality where old indian buryinggrounds were common but weeden and smith drew their own inferencesit was in january 1770 whilst weeden and smith were still debating vainly on what if anything to think or do about the whole bewildering business that the incident of thefortalezaoccurred exasperated by the burning of the revenue slooplibertyat newport during the previous summer the customs fleet under admiral wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels and on this occasion his majestys armed schoonercygnetunder capt charles leslie captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snowfortalezaof barcelona spain under capt manuel arruda bound according to its log from grand cairo egypt to providence when searched for contraband material this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of egyptian mummies consigned to sailor a b c who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off namquit point and whose identity capt arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal the viceadmiralty court at newport at a loss what to do in view of the noncontraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand compromised on collector robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in rhode island waters there were later rumours of its having been seen in boston harbour though it never openly entered the port of bostonthis extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in providence and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister joseph curwen his exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town as if conscious of this natural belief curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural yet stopping just short of admitting his participation weeden and smith of course felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing and indulged in the wildest theories concerning curwen and his monstrous laboursthe following spring like that of the year before had heavy rains and the watchers kept careful track of the riverbank behind the curwen farm large sections were washed away and a certain number of bones discovered but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows something was rumoured however at the village of pawtuxet about a mile below where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove there where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge and fishingsmacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls of course the pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards and of course the spring rains had been very heavy but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out that rumour sent smithfor weeden was just then at seain haste to the riverbank behind the farm where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cavein there was however no trace of a passage into the steep bank for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft smith went to the extent of some experimental digging but was deterred by lack of successor perhaps by fear of possible success it is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time4by the autumn of 1770 weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries for he had a large number of facts to link together and a second eyewitness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy as his first confidant he selected capt james mathewson of theenterprisewho on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect the colloquy took place in an upper room of sabins tavern near the docks with smith present to corroborate virtually every statement and it could be seen that capt mathewson was tremendously impressed like nearly everyone else in the town he had had black suspicions of his own anent joseph curwen hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely at the end of the conference he was very grave and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men he would he said transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of providence ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer secrecy would probably be essential in any case for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought curwen hitherthe right persons to tell he believed would be dr benjamin west whose pamphlet on the late transit of venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker rev james manning president of the college which had just moved up from warren and was temporarily housed in the new king street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above presbyterianlane exgovernor stephen hopkins who had been a member of the philosophical society at newport and was a man of very broad perceptions john carter publisher of thegazetteall four of the brown brothers john joseph nicholas and moses who formed the recognised local magnates and of whom joseph was an amateur scientist of parts old dr jabez bowen whose erudition was considerable and who had much firsthand knowledge of curwens odd purchases and capt abraham whipple a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed these men if favourable might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the governor of the colony joseph wanton of newport before taking actionthe mission of capt mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of weedens tale there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action curwen it was clear formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and colony and must be eliminated at any cost late in december 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of stephen hopkins and debated tentative measures weedens notes which he had given to capt mathewson were carefully read and he and smith were summoned to give testimony anent details something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over though there ran through that fear a grim determination which capt whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed they would not notify the governor because a more than legal course seemed necessary with hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town nameless reprisals might ensue and even if the sinister creature complied the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place the times were lawless and men who had flouted the kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled curwen must be surprised at his pawtuxet farm by a large raidingparty of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself if he proved a madman amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices he would be properly confined if something graver appeared and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real he and all with him must die it could be done quietly and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came aboutwhile these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around in the middle of a moonlight january night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window and people around weybosset point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the turks head there was a baying of dogs in the distance but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening but nothing rewarded their search the next morning however a giant muscular body stark naked was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the great bridge where the long dock stretched out beside abbotts distilhouse and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering it was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horrorbulging eyes strike any chord of memory they shaking as they did so exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear for in those stiff hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identityand that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years beforeezra weeden was present at the finding and remembering the baying of the night before set out along weybosset street and across muddy dock bridge whence the sound had come he had a curious expectancy and was not surprised when reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the pawtuxet road he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow the naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced they had given up the chase upon coming too near the town weeden smiled grimly and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source it was the pawtuxet farm of joseph curwen as he well knew it would be and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled as it was he dared not seem too interested in full daylight dr bowen to whom weeden went at once with his report performed an autopsy on the strange corpse and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly the digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use whilst the whole skin had a coarse loosely knit texture impossible to account for impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the longdead blacksmith daniel green whose greatgrandson aaron hoppin was a supercargo in curwens employ weeden asked casual questions till he found where green was buried that night a party of ten visited the old north burying ground opposite herrendens lane and opened a grave they found it vacant precisely as they had expectedmeanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept joseph curwens mail and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one jedediah orne of salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply parts of it copied and preserved in the private archives of the smith family where charles ward found it ran as followsi delight that you continue

unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet in the smith diary found by charles ward a single oftrepeated combination of characters is clumsily copied and authorities at brown university have pronounced the alphabet amharic or abyssinian although they do not recognise the word none of these epistles was ever delivered to curwen though the disappearance of jedediah orne from salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the providence men took certain quiet steps the pennsylvania historical society also has some curious letters received by dr shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in philadelphia but more decisive steps were in the air and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of weedens disclosures slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of joseph curwens noxious mysteriescurwen despite all precautions apparently felt that something was in the wind for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look his coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the pawtuxet road and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice the nearest neighbours to his farm the fenners one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high excessively narrow windows an event which they quickly communicated to john brown in providence mr brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on curwens extirpation and had informed the fenners that some action was about to be taken this he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid and he explained his course by saying that curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at newport against whom the hand of every providence shipper merchant and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain but at any rate the fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways to them mr brown had entrusted the duty of watching the curwen farmhouse and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there5the probability that curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things as suggested by the odd shaft of light precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens according to the smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 pm on friday april 12th 1771 in the great room of thurstons tavern at the sign of the golden lion on weybosset point across the bridge of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader john brown there were present dr bowen with his case of surgical instruments president manning without the great periwig the largest in the colonies for which he was noted governor hopkins wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother esek whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest john carter capt mathewson and capt whipple who was to lead the actual raiding party these chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber after which capt whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions eleazar smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of ezra weeden whose duty was to keep track of curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farmabout 1030 a heavy rumble was heard on the great bridge followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside and at that hour there was no need of waiting for weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry a moment later as the receding coach clattered faintly over the muddy dock bridge weeden appeared and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street shouldering the firelocks fowlingpieces or whaling harpoons which they had with them weeden and smith were with the party and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service capt whipple the leader capt esek hopkins john carter president manning capt mathewson and dr bowen together with moses brown who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern all these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the muddy dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of broad street toward the pawtuxet road just beyond elder snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at providence lying outspread under the early spring stars steeples and gables rose dark and shapely and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the bridge vega was climbing above the great hill across the water whose crest of trees was broken by the roofline of the unfinished college edifice at the foot of that hill and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side the old town dreamed old providence for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped outan hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived as previously agreed at the fenner farmhouse where they heard a final report on their intended victim he had reached his farm over half an hour before and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky but there were no lights in any visible windows this was always the case of late even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders capt whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions one of twenty men under eleazar smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landingplace against possible reinforcements for curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service a second of twenty men under capt esek hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high steep bank and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves of this division one third was to be led by capt mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows another third to follow capt whipple himself to the main farmhouse and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signalthe river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistleblast then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within at the sound of two whistleblasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent the party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner forcing an entrance at the first and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns a third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building capt whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans he had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals the final reserve at the landing of course was nearly out of the whistles range hence would require a special messenger if needed for help moses brown and john carter went with capt hopkins to the riverbank while president manning was detailed with capt mathewson to the stone building dr bowen with ezra weeden remained in capt whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself the attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from capt hopkins had joined capt whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness the leader would then deliver the loud single blast and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points shortly before 1 am the three divisions left the fenner farmhouse one to guard the landing another to seek the river valley and the hillside door and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the curwen farmeleazar smith who accompanied the shoreguarding party records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots and still later smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air it was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been joseph curwen something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed for though he was a seaman well known to many of them there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart it was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable they had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures and could not forget it from them there was never any gossip for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries and from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them and eleazar smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the sign of the golden lion under the starscharles ward however discovered another vague sidelight in some fenner correspondence which he found in new london where he knew another branch of the family had lived it seems that the fenners from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible had watched the departing columns of raiders and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the curwen dogs followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack this blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building and in another moment after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent luke fenner had represented in his epistle by the characterswaaaahrrrrrrwaaahrrrthis cry however had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound it was later repeated less loudly and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river about an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece a strong smell of sulphur was noted and luke fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal though the others failed to detect it muffled musketry sounded again followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it a kind of throaty nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic valuethen the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the curwen farm ought to lie and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard muskets flashed and cracked and the flaming thing fell to the ground a second flaming thing appeared and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy almighty protect thy lamb then there were more shots and the second flaming thing fell after that came silence for about threequarters of an hour at the end of which time little arthur fenner lukes brother exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance no one but the child can testify to this but luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the roomfive minutes later a chill wind blew up and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in pawtuxet village this stench was nothing which any of the fenners had ever encountered before and produced a kind of clutching amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnelhouse close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget it thundered out of the sky like a doom and windows rattled as its echoes died away it was deep and musical powerful as a bass organ but evil as the forbidden books of the arabs what it said no man can tell for it spoke in an unknown tongue but this is the writing luke fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations deesmeesjeshetbone dosefe duvemaenitemoss not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge but charles ward paled as he recognised what mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantationsan unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the curwen farm after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable a wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms at times it became almost articulate though no auditor could trace any definite words and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter then a yell of utter ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throatsa yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst after which darkness and silence ruled all things spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following daytoward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the fenner door and requested a keg of rum for which they paid very well indeed one of them told the family that the affair of joseph curwen was over and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again arrogant as the order seemed the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority so that only these furtive letters of luke fenner which he urged his connecticut relative to destroy remain to tell what was seen and heard the noncompliance of that relative whereby the letters were saved after all has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion charles ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions old charles slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of joseph curwen was announced what kept the talk alive was the notion that this body so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about6not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party there is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter eight sailors had been killed but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred the same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by dr jabez bowen who had accompanied the party hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders a thing which was discussed for weeks of the citizen leaders capt whipple and moses brown were most severely hurt and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced psychologically every participant was aged sobered and shaken it is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple orthodox religionists for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed president manning was the most disturbed but even he outgrew the darkest shadow and smothered memories in prayers every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so little more than a twelvemonth afterward capt whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue shipgaspeeand in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome imagesthere was delivered to the widow of joseph curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design obviously found ready on the spot when needed in which she was told her husbands body lay he had it was explained been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details more than this no tongue ever uttered of joseph curwens end and charles ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory this hint was the merest threada shaky underscoring of a passage in jedediah ornes confiscated letter to curwen as partly copied in ezra weedens handwriting the copy was found in the possession of smiths descendants and we are left to decide whether weeden gave it to his companion after the end as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred or whether as is more probable smith had it before and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit crossquestioning the underlined passage is merely thisi say to you againe doe not call up any that you can not put downe by the which i meane any that can in turne call up somewhat against you whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use ask of the lesser lest the greater shall not wish to answer and shall commande more than youin the light of this passage and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity charles ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of providence killed joseph curwenthe deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders they had not at first meant to be so thorough and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions but capt tillinghast was an astute man and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name burn the library and all remaining papers and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above joseph curwens grave he knew capt whipple well and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcererfrom that time on the obliteration of curwens memory became increasingly rigid extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of thegazetteit can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on oscar wildes name for a decade after his disgrace and in extent only to the fate of that sinful king of runazar in lord dunsanys tale whom the gods decided must not only cease to be but must cease ever to have beenmrs tillinghast as the widow became known after 1772 sold the house in olney court and resided with her father in powers lane till her death in 1817 the farm at pawtuxet shunned by every living soul remained to moulder through the years and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity by 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps none ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the riverbank behind which the hillside door may have lain nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which joseph curwen departed from the horrors he had wroughtonly robust old capt whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself pox on that but he had no business to laugh while he screamed twas as though the damnd had someat up his sleeve for half a crown id burn his houseiii a search and an evocation1charles ward as we have seen first learned in 1918 of his descent from joseph curwen that he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at for every vague rumour that he had heard of curwen now became something vital to himself in whom flowed curwens blood no spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of curwen datain his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy so that even dr lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919 he talked freely with his familythough his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like curwenand with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited in applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letterwriters were regarded he often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find and what joseph curwen really had beenwhen he came across the smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from jedediah orne he decided to visit salem and look up curwens early activities and connexions there which he did during the easter vacation of 1919 at the essex institute which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs he was very kindly received and unearthed there a considerable amount of curwen data he found that his ancestor was born in salemvillage now danvers seven miles from town on the eighteenth of february os 16623 and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen not appearing again for nine years when he returned with the speech dress and manners of a native englishman and settled in salem proper at that time he had little to do with his family but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from europe and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from england france and holland certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at nightcurwens only close friends had been one edward hutchinson of salemvillage and one simon orne of salem with these men he was often seen in conference about the common and visits among them were by no means infrequent hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night he was said to entertain strange visitors and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour the knowledge he displayed concerning longdead persons and longforgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began never to be heard from again at that time joseph curwen also departed but his settlement in providence was soon learned of simon orne lived in salem until 1720 when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention he thereafter disappeared though thirty years later his precise counterpart and selfstyled son turned up to claim his property the claim was allowed on the strength of documents in simon ornes known hand and jedediah orne continued to dwell in salem till 1771 when certain letters from providence citizens to the rev thomas barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknowncertain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the essex institute the court house and the registry of deeds and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature there were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records as when one hepzibah lawson swore on july 10 1692 at the court of oyer and terminer under judge hathorne that fortie witches and the blacke man were wont to meete in the woodes behind mr hutchinsons house and one amity how declared at a session of august 8th before judge gedney that mr g b rev george burroughs on that nighte putt yedivell his marke upon bridget s jonathan asimon odeliverance wjoseph csusan p mehitable c and deborah b then there was a catalogue of hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting couched in a cipher none could read ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him after the following august his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before october or november he never stated though whether or not he had succeededbut of the greatest immediate interest was the orne material it took ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to curwen namely that simon orne and his supposed son were one and the same person as orne had said to his correspondent it was hardly safe to live too long in salem hence he resorted to a thirtyyear sojourn abroad and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder there were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which ward now either copied with care or had photographed and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the registry of deeds as positively joseph curwensthis curwen letter though undated as to the year was evidently not the one in answer to which orne had written the confiscated missive and from internal evidence ward placed it not much later than 1750 it may not be amiss to give the text in full as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible the recipient is addressed as simon but a line whether drawn by curwen or orne ward could not tell is run through the wordprouidence i may ut vulgobrothermy honourd antient

letter oddly enough was what first gave ward the exact location of curwens providence home for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific the discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old a dilapidated building still standing in olney court and well known to ward in his antiquarian rambles over stampers hill the place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing housecleaning and furnacetending services to find in distant salem such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history was a highly impressive thing to ward and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return the more mystical phases of the letter which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism frankly baffled him though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the biblical passage referred tojob 14 14was the familiar verse if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come2young ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement and spent the following saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in olney court the place now crumbling with age had never been a mansion but was a modest twoandahalf story wooden town house of the familiar providence colonial type with plain peaked roof large central chimney and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight triangular pediment and trim doric pilasters it had suffered but little alteration externally and ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his questthe present negro inhabitants were known to him and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old asa and his stout wife hannah here there was more change than the outside indicated and ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scrollandurn overmantels and shellcarved cupboard linings were gone whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked hacked and gouged or covered up altogether with cheap wallpaper in general the survey did not yield as much as ward had somehow expected but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as joseph curwen he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knockerfrom then until after the close of school ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local curwen data the former still proved unyielding but of the latter he obtained so much and so many clues to similar data elsewhere that he was ready by july to make a trip to new london and new york to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated this trip was very fruitful for it brought him the fenner letters with their terrible description of the pawtuxet farmhouse raid and the nightingaletalbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the curwen library this matter of the portrait interested him particularly since he would have given much to know just what joseph curwen looked like and he decided to make a second search of the house in olney court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wallpaperearly in august that search took place and ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder he paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained and was keenly excited after about an hour when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious groundfloor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been a few more careful tests with a thin knife and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent with truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help in three days he returned with an artist of long experience mr walter c dwight whose studio is near the foot of college hill and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances old asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearthas day by day the work of restoration progressed charles ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion dwight had begun at the bottom hence since the picture was a threequarterlength one the face did not come out for some time it was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare wellshaped man with darkblue coat embroidered waistcoat black satin smallclothes and white silk stockings seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond when the head came out it was observed to bear a neat albemarle wig and to possess a thin calm undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both ward and the artist only at the very last though did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean pallid visage and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played for it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden and to confront the bewildered charles dexter ward dweller in the past with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible greatgreatgreatgrandfatherward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling the resemblance to the boy despite an appearance of rather greater age was marvellous and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of joseph curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half mrs wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone curwen she did not relish the discovery and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home there was she averred something unwholesome about it not only intrinsically but in its very resemblance to charles mr ward however was a practical man of power and affairsa cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at riverpoint in the pawtuxet valleyand not one to listen to feminine scruples the picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son and he believed the boy deserved it as a present in this opinion it is needless to say charles most heartily concurred and a few days later mr ward located the owner of the housea small rodentfeatured person with a guttural accentand obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous hagglingit now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the ward home where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mockfireplace in charless thirdfloor study or library to charles was left the task of superintending this removal and on the twentyeighth of august he accompanied two expert workmen from the crooker decorating firm to the house in olney court where the mantel and portraitbearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck there was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course and in this young ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait curious as to what such a space might mean or contain the youth approached and looked within finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers a crude thick copybook and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover it was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the essex institute and proclaimed the volume as thejournall and notes of jos curwen gent of providenceplantations late of salemexcited beyond measure by his discovery ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding and dr willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities all the other papers were likewise in curwens handwriting and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscriptionto him who shal come after how he may gett beyonde time yespheresanother was in a cipher the same ward hoped as the hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him a third and here the searcher rejoiced seemed to be a key to the cipher whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to edw hutchinson armiger and jedediah orne esq or their heir or heirs or those representg them the sixth and last was inscribedjoseph curwen his life and travells betn yeyeares 1678 and 1687 of whither he voyagd where he stayd whom he sawe and what he learnt3we have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date charles wards madness upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously indeed in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself he did not even shew the titles to his parents but simply told them that he had found some documents in joseph curwens handwriting mostly in cipher which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning it is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity as it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matterthat night charles ward sat up in his room reading the newfound book and papers and when day came he did not desist his meals on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss were sent up to him and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study the next night he slept in snatches in his clothes meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript in the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher which he had frequently shewn her before but in response to her query he said that the curwen key could not be applied to it that afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log setting the mockfireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms the front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it after the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a yearadding and centuryrecalling mirrorhis parents subsequently recalling his conduct at this period give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying since he rightly assumed that curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them with his parents however he was more circumspect and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs as that entitledto him who shal come afteretc seemed to be he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed at night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his where he also placed them whenever he left the room he soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease the opening of school where he now began his senior year seemed a great bore to him and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college he had he said important special investigations to make which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boastnaturally only one who had always been more or less studious eccentric and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice ward however was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted at the same time both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasuretrove nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered this reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all curwen delvingsduring october ward began visiting the libraries again but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days witchcraft and magic occultism and daemonology were what he sought now and when providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for boston and tap the wealth of the great library in copley square the widener library at harvard or the zion research library in brookline where certain rare works on biblical subjects are available he bought extensively and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects while during the christmas holidays he made a round of outoftown trips including one to salem to consult certain records at the essex instituteabout the middle of january 1920 there entered wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain and he was no more found at work upon the hutchinson cipher instead he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and recordscanning fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in providence local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies later questioned gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased but clerks at the state house the city hall and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest he was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of joseph curwen from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the namelittle by little there grew upon the ward family the conviction that something was wrong charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him his school work was the merest pretence and although he failed in no test it could be seen that the old application had all vanished he had other concernments now and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study where the startlinglyone almost fancied increasinglysimilar features of joseph curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north walllate in march ward added to his archivesearching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city the cause appeared later when it was learned from city hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue his quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of joseph curwen to that of one naphthali field and this shift was explained when upon going over the files that he had been over the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred 10 ft s and 5 ft w of naphthali fields grave in ye the lack of a specified buryingground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search and naphthali fields grave seemed as elusive as that of curwen but here no systematic effacement had existed and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished hence the ramblesfrom which st johns the former kings churchyard and the ancient congregational buryingground in the midst of swan point cemetery were excluded since other statistics had shewn that the only naphthali field obiit 1729 whose grave could have been meant had been a baptist4it was toward may when dr willett at the request of the senior ward and fortified with all the curwen data which the family had gleaned from charles in his nonsecretive days talked with the young man the interview was of little value or conclusiveness for willett felt at every moment that charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour of a pallid impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits though not to reveal their object he stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge for the most part in cipher of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of friar bacon and perhaps surpassing even those they were however meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance to take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved and to this task of correlation ward was now devoting himself he was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the curwen data must possess and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought not even einstein he declared could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of thingsas to his graveyard search whose object he freely admitted but the details of whose progress he did not relate he said he had reason to think that joseph curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbolscarved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the namewhich were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system curwen he believed had wished to guard his secret with care and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion when dr willett asked to see the mystic documents ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the hutchinson cipher and orne formulae and diagrams but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real curwen findsthejournall and notesthe cipher title in cipher also and the formulafilled messageto him who shal come afterand let him glance inside such as were in obscure charactershe also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave willett a glimpse of curwens connected handwriting in english the doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century and became quickly certain that the document was genuine the text itself was relatively trivial and

reaching this point dr willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by ward who almost snatched the book from his grasp all that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief

entertained the odd fancywhich his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancythat the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish if not an actual tendency to follow young charles ward as he moved about the room he stopped before leaving to study the picture closely marvelling at its resemblance to charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical colourless face even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye cosmo alexander he decided was a painter worthy of the scotland that produced raeburn and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil gilbert stuartassured by the doctor that charless mental health was in no danger but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance the wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following june the youth made positive his refusal to attend college he had he declared studies of much more vital importance to pursue and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in america the senior ward while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen acquiesced regarding the university so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the moses brown school there ensued for charles a threeyear period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching he became recognised as an eccentric and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article again he sought a small village in the adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come but still his parents forbade him the trip to the old world which he desiredcoming of age in april 1923 and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather ward determined at last to take the european trip hitherto denied him of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully when they saw he could not be dissuaded they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could so that in june the young man sailed for liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother who accompanied him to boston and waved him out of sight from the white star pier in charlestown letters soon told of his safe arrival and of his securing good quarters in great russell street london where he proposed to stay shunning all family friends till he had exhausted the resources of the british museum in a certain direction of his daily life he wrote but little for there was little to write study and experiment consumed all his time and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms that he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mindin june 1924 a brief note told of his departure for paris to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the bibliothque nationale for three months thereafter he sent only postal cards giving an address in the rue st jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector he avoided acquaintances and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him then came a silence and in october the wards received a picture card from prague czechoslovakia stating that charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information he gave an address in the neustadt and announced no move till the following january when he dropped several cards from vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellowdelvers into the occult had invited himthe next card was from klausenburg in transylvania and told of wards progress toward his destination he was going to visit a baron ferenczy whose estate lay in the mountains east of rakus and was to be addressed at rakus in the care of that nobleman another card from rakus a week later saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains was his last message for a considerable time indeed he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until may when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in london paris or rome during the summer when the elder wards were planning to travel in europe his researches he said were such that he could not leave his present quarters while the situation of baron ferenczys castle did not favour visits it was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease moreover the baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative new england gentlefolk his aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies and his age was so great as to be disquieting it would be better charles said if his parents would wait for his return to providence which could scarcely be far distantthat return did not however take place until may 1926 when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into new york on thehomericand traversed the long miles to providence by motorcoach eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills the fragrant blossoming orchards and the white steepled towns of vernal connecticut his first taste of ancient new england in nearly four years when the coach crossed the pawcatuck and entered rhode island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force and the entry to providence along reservoir and elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved at the high square where broad weybosset and empire streets join he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind the biltmore bringing into view the great dome and soft roofpierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river and the tall colonial spire of the first baptist church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous backgroundold providence it was this place and the mysterious forces of its long continuous history which had brought him into being and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix here lay the arcana wondrous or dreadful as the case might be for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him a taxicab whirled him through post office square with its glimpse of the river the old market house and the head of the bay and up the steep curved slope of waterman street to prospect where the vast gleaming dome and sunsetflushed ionic columns of the christian science church beckoned northward then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet and at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right on the left the classic adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born it was twilight and charles dexter ward had come home5a school of alienists slightly less academic than dr lymans assign to wards european trip the beginning of his true madness admitting that he was sane when he started they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change but even to this claim dr willett refuses to accede there was he insists something later and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroadodd enough things to be sure but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant ward himself though visibly aged and hardened was still normal in his general reactions and in several talks with willett displayed a balance which no madmaneven an incipient onecould feign continuously for long what elicited the notion of insanity at this period were thesoundsheard at all hours from wards attic laboratory in which he kept himself most of the time there were chantings and repetitions and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms and although these sounds were always in wards own voice there was something in the quality of that voice and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced which could not but chill the blood of every hearer it was noticed that nig the venerable and beloved black cat of the household bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heardthe odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange sometimes they were very noxious but more often they were aromatic with a haunting elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images people who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance ward did not resume his oldtime rambles but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home and to equally strange delvings within his quarters explaining that european sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work and promising great revelations in the years to come his older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the curwen portrait in his library and dr willett would often pause by the latter after a call marvelling at the virtual identity and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the longdead wizard from the living youth these calls of willetts undertaken at the request of the senior wards were curious affairs ward at no time repulsed the doctor but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology frequently he noted peculiar things about little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables and the halferased remnants of circles triangles and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room and always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of charless madnessin january 1927 a peculiar incident occurred one night about midnight as charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay and a faint obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted at the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around this was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm anomalous for the season which brought with it such a crash that mr and mrs ward believed the house had been struck they rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done but charles met them at the door to the attic pale resolute and portentous with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face he assured them that the house had not really been struck and that the storm would soon be over they paused and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right for the lightning flashed farther and farther off whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water the thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away stars came out and the stamp of triumph on charles wards face crystallised into a very singular expressionfor two months or more after this incident ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory he exhibited a curious interest in the weather and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground one night late in march he left the house after midnight and did not return till almost morning when his mother being wakeful heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance muffled oaths could be distinguished and mrs ward rising and going to the window saw four dark figures removing a long heavy box from a truck at charless direction and carrying it within by the side door she heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs and finally a dull thumping in the attic after which the footfalls descended again and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truckthe next day charles resumed his strict attic seclusion drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance he would open the door to no one and steadfastly refused all proffered food about noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard but when mrs ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly and told her that nothing had gone amiss the hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary solitude was the one prime essential and he would appear later for dinner that afternoon after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal he did finally appear wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext this indeed proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out furnished roughly and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment here he lived with books brought up from his library beneath till the time he purchased the pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effectsin the evening charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident later on dr willett having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household looked up an intact copy at thejournaloffice and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurrednocturnal diggers surprised innorth burial groundrobert hart night watchman at the north burial ground this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have beenthe discovery took place at about four oclock when harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter investigating he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach the men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken and since no known grave was disturbed hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to burythe diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection for hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of amasa field where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared the hole a place as large and deep as a grave was empty and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery recordssergt riley of the second station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed in reply to questions hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up rochambeau avenue though he could not be sureduring the next few days ward was seldom seen by his family having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm he kept closely to himself there ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away the droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass hissing chemicals running water or roaring gas flames odours of the most unplaceable quality wholly unlike any before noted hung at times around the door and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation once he made a hasty trip to the athenaeum for a book he required and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from boston suspense was written portentously over the whole situation and both the family and dr willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it6then on the fifteenth of april a strange development occurred while nothing appeared to grow different in kind there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree and dr willett somehow attaches great significance to the change the day was good friday a circumstance of which the servants made much but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence late in the afternoon young ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house the formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that mrs ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously and later on she was able to write it down at dr willetts request it ran as follows and experts have told dr willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of eliphas levi that cryptic

the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in the extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day but to those in the ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it a hideous allpervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since in the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around and then was heardthe voicethat no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness its incredible depth and its eldritch dissimilarity to charles wards voice it shook the house and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs mrs ward who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory shivered as she recognised its hellish import for charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books and of the manner in which it had thundered according to the fenner letters above the doomed pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of joseph curwens annihilation there was no mistaking that nightmare phrase for charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his curwen investigations and yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language dies mies jeschet boene doesef douvema enitemausclose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight though sunset was still an hour distant and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like yinashyogsothothhelgebfithrodogending in a yah whose maniacal force mounted in an earsplitting crescendo a second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter mrs ward with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels but obtained no sign of recognition she knocked again but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her sonand sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voicepresently she fainted although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause memory sometimes makes merciful deletionsmr ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six and not finding his wife downstairs was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at charless door from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before mounting the stairs at once he saw mrs ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory and realising that she had fainted hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove dashing the cold fluid in her face he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging for the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be but held the murmurs of a tense muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soulit was not of course new for charles to mutter formulae but this muttering was definitely different it was so palpably a dialogue or imitation of a dialogue with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer statement and response one voice was undisguisedly that of charles but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before there was something hideous blasphemous and abnormal about it and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that theodore howland ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted as it was he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him even so however he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden for mrs wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded they were merely an excited caution in charless own voice but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them the phrase was just thissshhwritemr and mrs ward conferred at some length after dinner and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with charles that very night no matter how important the object such conduct could no longer be permitted for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous wellbeing of the entire household the youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth all this must be stopped or mrs ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibilitymr ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for charless laboratory on the third floor however he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled and upon stepping to the door mr ward beheld the youth within excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape charless aspect was very drawn and haggard and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice at the elder mans command he sat down and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved there was no scene at the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right and that his noises mutterings incantations and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances he agreed to a policy of greater quiet though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy much of his future work he said was in any case purely book research and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage for the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere his use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered mr ward but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity the interview was really quite inconclusive and as charles picked up his armful and left the room mr ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business it was as mysterious as the death of poor old nig whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement with staring eyes and feardistorted mouthdriven by some vague detective instinct the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic the youths library was plainly and rigidly classified so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn on this occasion mr ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian beyond what had been previously removed was missing these new withdrawals were all modern items histories scientific treatises geographies manuals of literature philosophic works and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines it was a very curious shift from charles wards recent run of reading and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness the strangeness was a very poignant sensation and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him something was indeed wrong and tangibly as well as spiritually so ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss and at last it dawned upon him what it wason the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in olney court but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large curwen portrait disaster had come time and unequal heating had done their work at last and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened peeling clear of the wood curling tighter and tighter and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness the portrait of joseph curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluishgrey dustiv a mutation and a madness1in the week following that memorable good friday charles ward was seen more often than usual and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory his actions were quiet and rational but he had a furtive hunted look which his mother did not like and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook dr willett had been told of those friday noises and happenings and on the following tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more the interview was as always inconclusive but willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time he held out promises of an early revelation and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere at the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumblingabout the second week charles began to be absent from the house for long periods and one day when good old black hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in olney court where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar he was always very liberal to her and to old asa but seemed more worried than he used to be which grieved her very much since she had watched him grow up from birth another report of his doings came from pawtuxet where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times he seemed to haunt the resort and canoehouse of rhodesonthepawtuxet and subsequent inquiries by dr willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedgedin riverbank along which he would walk toward the north usually not reappearing for a very long whilelate in may came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from mr ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from charles it occurred one morning and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent good friday the youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused mrs ward to run upstairs and listen at the door she could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were must have it red for three months and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once when charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid but which he would try to transfer to other realmsabout the middle of june a queer nocturnal incident occurred in the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs and mr ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down that midnight after the family had retired the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress the youth spoke no word but the worthy yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly he opened the door and young ward went out but in the morning he presented his resignation to mrs ward there was he said something unholy in the glance charles had fixed on him it was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person and he could not possibly stay another night mrs ward allowed the man to depart but she did not value his statement highly to fancy charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above sounds as if of sobbing and pacing and of a sighing which told only of despairs profoundest depths mrs ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mindthe next evening much as on another evening nearly three months before charles ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section the matter was not recalled till later when dr willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there in thejournaloffice he found the section which charles had lost and marked two items as of possible significance they were as followsmore cemetery delvingit was this morning discovered by robert hart night watchman at the north burial ground that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery the grave of ezra weeden who was born in 1740 and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone was found excavated and rifled the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent toolshedwhatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood there were no wheel tracks but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity and which indicate the boots of a man of refinementhart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last march when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation but sergt riley of the second station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases in march the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known but this time a wellmarked and caredfor grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day beforemembers of the weeden family notified of the happening expressed their astonishment and regret and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor hazard weeden of 598 angell street recalls a family legend according to which ezra weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances not dishonourable to himself shortly before the revolution but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant inspector cunningham has been assigned to the case and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near futuredogs noisy in pawtuxetresidents of pawtuxet were aroused about 3 am today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of rhodesonthepawtuxet the volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd according to most who heard it and fred lemdin night watchman at rhodes declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony a sharp and very brief thunderstorm which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river put an end to the disturbance strange and unpleasant odours probably from the oil tanks along the bay are popularly linked with this incident and may have had their share in exciting the dogsthe aspect of charles now became very haggard and hunted and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him the morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator these cases too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities the residential hill and the north end near the ward home and the suburban districts across the cranston line near pawtuxet both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean lithe leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenouslydr willett who refuses to date the madness of charles ward as far back as even this is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors he has he declares certain theories of his own and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation i will not he says state who or what i believe perpetrated these attacks and murders but i will declare that charles ward was innocent of them i have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument ward meddled with terrible things but he has paid for it and he was never a monster or a villain as for nowi dont like to think a change came and im content to believe that the old charles ward died with it his soul did anyhow for that mad flesh that vanished from waites hospital had anotherwillett speaks with authority for he was often at the ward home attending mrs ward whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy and which he ridiculed in talking to her although they made him ponder deeply when alone these delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times early in july willett ordered mrs ward to atlantic city for an indefinite recuperative sojourn and cautioned both mr ward and the haggard and elusive charles to write her only cheering letters it is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity2not long after his mothers departure charles ward began negotiating for the pawtuxet bungalow it was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above rhodes but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else he gave the realestate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study he had this van loaded in the black small hours and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away after that charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor and never haunted the attic againto the pawtuxet bungalow charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries a villainouslooking portuguese halfcaste from the south main st waterfront who acted as a servant and a thin scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation the mulatto gomes spoke very little english and the bearded man who gave his name as dr allen voluntarily followed his example ward himself tried to be more affable but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the allnight burning of lights and somewhat later after this burning had suddenly ceased there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butchers and of the muffled shouting declamation rhythmic chanting and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of edgewoodward spent most of his time at the bungalow but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his fathers roof twice he was absent from the city on weeklong trips whose destinations have not yet been discovered he grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to dr willett his old old story of vital research and future revelations willett often waylaid him at his fathers house for the elder ward was deeply worried and perplexed and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult the doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this and adduces many a conversation to prove his pointabout september the vampirism declined but in the following january ward almost became involved in serious trouble for some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents in a lonely spot near hope valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by hijackers in quest of liquor shipments but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock for the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things so gruesome in fact that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld the thieves had hastily buried what they discovered but when the state police got wind of the matter a careful search was made a recently arrested vagrant under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing it would not be well for the nationalor even the internationalsense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party there was no mistaking it even by these far from studious officers and telegrams to washington ensued with feverish rapiditythe cases were addressed to charles ward at his pawtuxet bungalow and state and federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call they found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence he had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be of theidentityof the specimens he had known absolutely nothing and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce in this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague dr allen whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones so that in the end the officials took no action but carefully set down the new york name and address which ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing it is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbanceon february 9 1928 dr willett received a letter from charles ward which he considers of extraordinary importance and about which he has frequently quarrelled with dr lyman lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a welldeveloped case ofdementia praecoxbut willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth he calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship which though shewing traces of shattered nerves is nevertheless distinctly wards own the text in full is as follows100 prospect stprovidence rifebruary 8 1928dear dr willetti feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which i have so long promised you and for which you have pressed me so often the patience you have shewn in waiting and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity are things i shall never cease to appreciateand now that i am ready to speak i must own with humiliation that no triumph such as i dreamed of can ever be mine instead of triumph i have found terror and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation you recall what those fenner letters said of the old raiding party at pawtuxet that must all be done again and quickly upon us depends more than can be put into wordsall civilisation all natural law perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe i have brought to light a monstrous abnormality but i did it for the sake of knowledge now for the sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark againi have left that pawtuxet place forever and we must extirpate everything existing there alive or dead i shall not go there again and you must not believe it if you ever hear that i am there i will tell you why i say this when i see you i have come home for good and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what i have to say it will take that longand believe me when i tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this my life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balancei dare not tell my father for he could not grasp the whole thing but i have told him of my danger and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house i dont know how much good they can do for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge so come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hellany time will doi shall not be out of the house dont telephone ahead for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you and let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meetingin utmost gravity and desperationcharles dexter wardps shoot dr allen on sightand dissolve his body in aciddont burn itdr willett received this note about 1030 am and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary he planned to arrive about four oclock and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger willett had seen too much of charles wards oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving that something very subtle ancient and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure and the reference to dr allen could almost be comprehended in view of what pawtuxet gossip said of wards enigmatical colleague willett had never seen the man but had heard much of his aspect and bearing and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those muchdiscussed dark glasses might concealpromptly at four dr willett presented himself at the ward residence but found to his annoyance that charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors the guards were there but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity he had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone one of the detectives said replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as i am very tired and must rest a while i cant receive anyone for some time youll have to excuse me please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise or i am very sorry but i must take a complete vacation from everything ill talk with you later then apparently gaining boldness through meditation he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one oclock and entered the house without a word he had gone upstairs where a bit of his fear must have surged back for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp when however the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued after which he had reappeared and left at once willett inquired whether or not any message had been left but was told that there was none the butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in charless appearance and manner and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nervesfor almost two hours dr willett waited vainly in charles wards library watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall whence a year before the suave features of old joseph curwen had looked mildly down after a time the shadows began to gather and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadowlike before the night mr ward finally arrived and shewed much surprise and anger at his sons absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him he had not known of charless appointment and promised to notify willett when the youth returned in bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his sons condition and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise willett was glad to escape from that library for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil he had never liked that picture and even now strongnerved though he was there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible3the next morning willett received a message from the senior ward saying that charles was still absent mr ward mentioned that dr allen had telephoned him to say that charles would remain at pawtuxet for some time and that he must not be disturbed this was necessary because allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period leaving the researches in need of charless constant oversight charles sent his best wishes and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused in listening to this message mr ward heard dr allens voice for the first time and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulnessfaced by these baffling and contradictory reports dr willett was frankly at a loss what to do the frantic earnestness of charless note was not to be denied yet what could one think of its writers immediate violation of his own expressed policy young ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost and that he himself would never return to their final scene yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside willett read it over again and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply its terror was too profound and real and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation there were nameless horrors abroad and no matter how little one might be able to get at them one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any timefor over a week dr willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him and became more and more inclined to pay charles a call at the pawtuxet bungalow no friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give but willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary mr ward had been receiving brief and noncommittal typed notes from his son and said that mrs ward in her atlantic city retirement had had no better word so at length the doctor resolved to act and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of joseph curwen and by more recent revelations and warnings from charles ward set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the riverwillett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence hence knew exactly the route to take driving out broad street one early afternoon toward the end of february in his small motor he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fiftyseven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehendthe ride through the citys decaying fringe was short and trim edgewood and sleepy pawtuxet presently spread out ahead willett turned to the right down lockwood street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond houses were still few here and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand and spoke without a tremor to the evil portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crackhe must he said see charles ward at once on vitally important business no excuse would be accepted and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder ward the mulatto still hesitated and pushed against the door when willett attempted to open it but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it let him in tony it said we may as well talk now as ever but disturbing as was the whisper the greater fear was that which immediately followed the floor creaked and the speaker hove in sightand the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than charles dexter wardthe minuteness with which dr willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period for at last he concedes a vital change in charles dexter wards mentality and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years controversy with dr lyman has compelled him to be very specific and he definitely dates the madness of charles ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents those notes are not in wards normal style not even in the style of that last frantic letter to willett instead they are strange and archaic as if the snapping of the writers mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism there is an obvious effort to be modern but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the pastthe past too was evident in wards every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow he bowed motioned willett to a seat and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outseti am grown phthisical he began from this cursed river air you must excuse my speech i suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me and i hope you will say nothing to alarm himwillett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care but studying even more closely the face of the speaker something he felt was wrong and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that yorkshire butler one night he wished it were not so dark but did not request that any blind be opened instead he merely asked ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week beforei was coming to that the host replied you must know i am in a very bad state of nerves and do and say queer things i cannot account for as i have told you often i am on the edge of great matters and the bigness of them has a way of making me lightheaded any man might well be frighted of what i have found but i am not to be put off for long i was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home for having gone this far my place is here i am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours and perhaps i was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me there is no evil to any in what i do so long as i do it rightly have the goodness to wait six months and ill shew you what will pay your patience wellyou may as well know i have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books and ill leave you to judge the importance of what i can give to history philosophy and the arts by reason of the doors i have access to my ancestor had all this when those witless peeping toms came and murdered him i now have it again or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it this time nothing must happen and least of all through any idiot fears of my own pray forget all i writ you sir and have no fear of this place or any in it dr allen is a man of fine parts and i owe him an apology for anything ill i have said of him i wish i had no need to spare him but there were things he had to do elsewhere his zeal is equal to mine in all those matters and i suppose that when i feared the work i feared him too as my greatest helper in itward paused and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think he felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the charles ward he knew willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results it was the same with all the alienists later on important sections of charles wards store of mental images mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life had been unaccountably expunged whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual the youths intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy and he tried his best to hide it when willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided byit was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriffs wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in mr douglass histrionick academy in king street on the eleventh of february 1762 which fell on a thursday or about how the actors cut the text of steelesconscious loversso badly that one was almost glad the baptistridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later that thomas sabins boston coach was damnd uncomfortable old letters may well have told but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of epenetus olneys new signboard the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the crown coffee house was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in pawtuxet were playingward however would not be quizzed long in this vein modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom what he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning to this end he offered to shew willett the entire house and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic willett looked sharply but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the wide gaps on wards shelves at home and that the meagre socalled laboratory was the flimsiest sort of a blind clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere but just where it was impossible to say essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name willett returned to town before evening and told the senior ward everything which had occurred they agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then above all mrs ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her sons own strange typed notes would permitmr ward now determined to call in person upon his son making it wholly a surprise visit dr willett took him in his car one evening guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return the session was a long one and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state his reception had developed much like willetts save that charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the portuguese away with an imperative demand and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection the lights had been dim yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously he had not spoken out loud at all averring that his throat was in very poor condition but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that mr ward could not banish it from his mindnow definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youths mental salvation mr ward and dr willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region dr willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure and from all he heard he could tell that young wards life had become indeed a strange one common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evillooking mulatto and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood for a household of only three these quantities were quite absurdthen there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth reports of these things were harder to pin down but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials noises of a ritual nature positively existed and at times when the bungalow was dark they might of course have come from the known cellar but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts recalling the ancient tales of joseph curwens catacombs and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture willett and mr ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention and searched many times without success for the door in the riverbank which old manuscripts mentioned as to popular opinions of the bungalows various inhabitants it was soon plain that the brava portuguese was loathed the bearded and spectacled dr allen feared and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent during the last week or two ward had obviously changed much abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forthsuch were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there and over these mr ward and dr willett held many long and serious conferences they strove to exercise deduction induction and constructive imagination to their utmost extent and to correlate every known fact of charless later life including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old joseph curwen they would have given much for a glimpse of the papers charles had found for very clearly the key to the youths madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings4and yet after all it was from no step of mr wards or dr willetts that the next move in this singular case proceeded the father and the physician rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other officials who knew charles ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible he could he said form no written characters at all except with great difficulty and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters even those to his father and mother who would bear out the assertionwhat made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious nor even the pawtuxet gossip of which one or two of them had caught echoes it was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before something was wrong for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech there could be no normal reason for this illconcealed blankness on vital points moreover although none of these men knew ward well they could not help observing the change in his language and manner they had heard he was an antiquarian but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures altogether this combination of hoarseness palsied hands bad memory and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior ward was imperativeso on the sixth of march 1928 there was a long and serious conference in mr wards office after which the utterly bewildered father summoned dr willett in a kind of helpless resignation willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note certainly the change was radical and profound and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing it had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used it was strangebut where had he seen it before on the whole it was obvious that charles was insane of that there could be no doubt and since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure it was then that the alienists were called in drs peck and waite of providence and dr lyman of boston to whom mr ward and dr willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast after scanning this material and examining the ominous note to willett they all agreed that charles wards studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents but this latter they knew they could do if at all only after a scene at the bungalow itself willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen charles find the curwen documents and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items looking up the latter at thejournalofficeon thursday the eighth of march drs willett peck lyman and waite accompanied by mr ward paid the youth their momentous call making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness charles though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance proved a far from recalcitrant subject and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies he offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon and seemed indeed to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory his conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to dr willett and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria he insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity of the whereabouts of dr allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed in paying off the stolid brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint he was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all it was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory his lost voice and handwriting and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him his mother it was agreed was not to be told of the change his father supplying typed notes in his name ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by dr waite on conanicut island in the bay and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case it was then that the physical oddities were noticed the slackened metabolism the altered skin and the disproportionate neural reactions dr willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners for he had attended ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before and which made willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places the doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witchtrial record from salem which charles had shewn him in the old nonsecretive days and which read mr

curwen and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careerswhile ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to dr allen which mr ward had ordered delivered at the family home willett had predicted that very little would be found since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger but in the latter part of march there did come a letter from prague for dr allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought it was in a very crabbed and archaic hand and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner shewed almost as singular a departure from modern english as the speech of young ward

degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply so the absent dr allen and not charles ward had come to be the leading spirit at pawtuxet that must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youths last frantic letter and what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as mr j c there was no escaping the inference but there are limits to possible monstrosity who was simon o the old man ward had visited in prague four years previously perhaps but in the centuries behind there had been another simon osimon orne alias jedediah of salem who vanished in 1771and whose peculiar handwriting dr willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the orne formulae which charles had once shewn himwhat horrors and mysteries what contradictions and contraventions of nature had come back after a century and a half to harass old providence with her clustered spires and domesthe father and the old physician virtually at a loss what to do or think went to see charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about dr allen about the prague visit and about what he had learned of simon or jedediah orne of salem to all these inquiries the youth was politely noncommittal merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found dr allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in prague would probably be similarly gifted when they left mr ward and dr willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism and that without imparting anything vital himself the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the prague letter had containeddrs peck waite and lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young wards companion for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together and believed that charles or allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpartperhaps one who had seen ornes handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone characters reincarnation allen himself was perhaps a similar case and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the longdead curwen such things had been known before and on the same basis the hardheaded doctors disposed of willetts growing disquiet about charles wards present handwriting as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old joseph curwen himself but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues willett advised mr ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for dr allen on the second of april from rakus transylvania in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal this read as followscastle

consulte these matters innephrenka nai hadothedw hfor j curwen esqprovidencebut if willett and mr ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves no amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled dr allen of whom charless frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of curwens old salem colleagues that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of joseph curwen and that he entertainedor was at least advised to entertainmurderous designs against a boy who could scarcely be other than charles ward there was organised horror afoot and no matter who had started it the missing allen was by this time at the bottom of it therefore thanking heaven that charles was now safe in the hospital mr ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor finding whence he had come and what pawtuxet knew of him and if possible discovering his current whereabouts supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which charles yielded up he urged them to explore allens vacant room which had been identified when the patients belongings had been packed obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about mr ward talked with the detectives in his sons old library and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanationv a nightmare and a cataclysm1and now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of marinus bicknell willett and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind dr willett had conferred at length with mr ward and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule there was they conceded a terrible movement alive in the world whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the salem witchcraft could not be doubted that at least two living menand one other of whom they dared not thinkwere in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws what these horrible creaturesand charles ward as wellwere doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case they were robbing the tombs of all the ages including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed thema hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group they had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive either in the same body or different bodies and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together there had it seems been some truth in chimerical old borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain essential saltes from which the shade of a longdead living thing might be raised up there was a formula for evoking such a shade and another for putting it down and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully one must be careful about evocations for the markers of old graves are not always accuratewillett and mr ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion thingspresences or voices of some sortcould be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave and in this process also one must be careful joseph curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things and as for charleswhat might one think of him what forces outside the spheres had reached him from joseph curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things he had been led to find certain directions and he had used them he had talked with the man of horror in prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of transylvania and he must have found the grave of joseph curwen at last that newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook then he had summoned something and it must have come that mighty voice aloft on good friday and thosedifferenttones in the locked attic laboratory what were they like with their depth and hollowness was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger dr allen with his spectral bass yesthatwas what mr ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the manif man it wereover the telephonewhat hellish consciousness or voice what morbid shade or presence had come to answer charles wards secret rites behind that locked door those voices heard in argumentmust have it red for three monthsgood god was not that just before the vampirism broke out the rifling of ezra weedens ancient grave and the cries later at pawtuxetwhose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies and then the bungalow and the bearded stranger and the gossip and the fear the final madness of charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain but they did feel sure that the mind of joseph curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility allen had something to do with it and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life in the meantime since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute some effort must be made to find it willett and mr ward conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground explorationthe morning of april 6th dawned clear and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock mr ward had the key and an entry and cursory survey were made from the disordered condition of dr allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value of course the main business lay in the cellar so thither they descended without much delay again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner for a time everything seemed baffling each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young ward and his associates where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome meansthe doctor tried to put himself in charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start but could not gain much inspiration from this method then he decided on elimination as a policy and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal trying to account for every inch separately he was soon substantially narrowed down and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs which he had tried once before in vain now experimenting in every possible way and exerting a double strength he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole to which mr ward at once rushed with excited zeal the cover was not hard to lift and the father had quite removed it when willett noticed the queerness of his aspect he was swaying and nodding dizzily and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample causein a moment dr willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water mr ward responded feebly but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him wishing to take no chances willett hastened out to broad street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weakvoiced protests after which he produced an electric torch covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze and descended once more to peer into the newfound depths the foul air had now slightly abated and willett was able to send a beam of light down the stygian hole for about ten feet he saw it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building2willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf he could not help thinking of what luke fenner had reported on that last monstrous night then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance slowly as befitted one of his years he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below this was ancient masonry his torch told him and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries down down ran the steps not spirally but in three abrupt turns and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty he had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly and after that he did not feel disposed to count any moreit was a godless sound one of those lowkeyed insidious outrages of nature which are not meant to be to call it a dull wail a doomdragged whine or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soulsickening overtones was it for this that ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed it was the most shocking thing that willett had ever heard and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways the hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad its pavement was of large chipped flagstones and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry its length he could not imagine for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness of the archways some had doors of the old sixpanelled colonial type whilst others had noneovercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling willett began to explore these archways one by one finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses most of them had fireplaces the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders for many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of joseph curwens experimentation finally there came a room of obvious modernity or at least of recent occupancy there were oil heaters bookshelves and tables chairs and cabinets and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places and finding a matchsafe handy willett lighted such as were ready for usein the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of charles ward of the books the doctor had seen many before and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the prospect street mansion here and there was a piece well known to willett and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps his first duty as planned long ahead was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance especially those portentous documents found by charles so long ago behind the picture in olney court as he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing once he found large packets of letters with prague and rakus postmarks and in writing clearly recognisable as ornes and hutchinsons all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valiseat last in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the ward home willett found the batch of old curwen papers recognising them from the reluctant glimpse charles had granted him so many years ago the youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to orne and hutchinson and the cipher with its key willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files since young wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted the oddity was the slight amount in charless normal writing which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before on the other hand there were literally reams of symbols and formulae historical notes and philosophical comment in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of joseph curwen though of undeniably modern dating plainly a part of the latterday programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing which charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection of any third hand which might have been allens there was not a trace if he had indeed come to be the leader he must have forced young ward to act as his amanuensisin this new material one mystic formula or rather pair of formulae recurred so often that willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest it consisted of two parallel columns the lefthand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called dragons head and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node and the righthand one headed by a corresponding sign of dragons tail or descending node the appearance of the whole was something like this and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd nameyogsothothwhich he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter the formulae were as followsexactlyso as willett is abundantly able to testifyand the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible good friday of the previous yearyai ngngahyogsothothheelgebfai throdoguaaahogthrod aifgebleehyogsothothngahng aiyzhroso haunting were these formulae and so frequently did he come upon them that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath eventually however he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid he had still to find the hidden laboratory so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whinethe next few rooms he tried were all abandoned or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominouslooking leaden coffins but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of joseph curwens original operations he thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world and of what that final raiding party must have seen and then he decided it was better not to think any more once a great stone staircase mounted at his right and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the curwen outbuildingsperhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slitlike windowsprovided the steps he had descended had led from the steeproofed farmhouse suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead and the stench and the wailing grew stronger willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space so great that his torchlight would not carry across it and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roofafter a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of stonehenge with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light but when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines instead he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry these cells were empty but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued more insistent now than ever and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping3from that frightful smell and that uncanny noise willetts attention could no longer be diverted both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else and carried a vague impression of being far below even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down the doctor cast his beam of light about the stoneflagged floor it was very loosely paved and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down to this ladder singularly enough appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything as he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs as if they might be crude trapdoors leading down to some still deeper region of horror kneeling by one he worked at it with his hands and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it at his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone a stench unnamable now rose up from below and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blacknessif he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination willett was destined to be disappointed for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brickfaced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent as the light shone down the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind futile scrambling and slippery thumping the explorer trembled unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the roughhewn brink lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below for a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy mossgrown brick walls sinking illimitably into that halftangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft which must have been from twenty to twentyfive feet below the stone floor where he lay the torch shook in his hand but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well left starving by young ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern whatever the things were they could not lie down in their cramped spaces but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheededbut marinus bicknell willett was sorry that he looked again for surgeon and veteran of the dissectingroom though he was he has not been the same since it is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision in that second look willett saw such an outline or entity for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of dr waites private hospital he dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit he screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries he tore his hands on the rough loose stones and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars but still he kept on then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided he was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror and crushed with a memory he never could efface beneath him dozens of those things still lived and from one of the shafts the cover was removed he knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foothold might existwhat the thing was he would never tell it was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar but it was alive nature had never made it in this form for it was too palpablyunfinishedthe deficiencies were of the most surprising sort and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which ward called up fromimperfect saltsand which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes if it had not had a certain significance its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone it was not the worst thing depicted on that stonebut willett never opened the other pits at the time the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old curwen data he had digested long before a phrase used by simon or jedediah orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer certainely there was nothg butt yeliveliest awfulness in that which h raisd upp from what he coud gather onlie a part ofthen horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned twisted thing found in the fields a week after the curwen raid charles ward had once told the doctor what old slocum said of that object that it was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read aboutthese words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro squatting on the nitrous stone floor he tried to drive them out and repeated the lords prayer to himself eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodgepodge like the modernisticwaste landof mr t s eliot and finally reverting to the oftrepeated dual formula he had lately found in wards underground libraryyai ngngah yogsothothand so on till the final underlinedzhroit seemed to soothe him and he staggered to his feet after a time lamenting bitterly his frightlost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air think he would not but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library after a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncoveredonce his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar and from this spot he recoiled in loathing at another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed and here his caution became almost pitiful but he did not come upon the dread aperture after all nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him what had been down there made no sound nor stir evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it each time willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled his passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below but generally it would produce no effect at all since he moved very noiselessly several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one the thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit for he knew that once the light failed his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party mr ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period presently however he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right in a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young wards secret library trembling with relief and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety4in another moment he was hastily filling the burnedout lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration for racked though he was with horror his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind charles wards bizarre madness failing to find a lantern he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry also filling his pockets with candles and matches and taking with him a gallon can of oil which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells to traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude but he knew it must be done fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cellindented wall which bounded the cavern area and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical searchso willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects one was packed with rotting and dustdraped bales of spare clothing and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before in another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men but what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared these and the sinister incrustations upon them he liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt when he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come and out of which many doors opened this he proceeded to investigate and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose businesslike tanks and tables furnaces and modern instruments occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the longsought laboratory of charles wardand no doubt of old joseph curwen before himafter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready dr willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry on the whole little could be learned from the scientific ensemble which included a gruesomelooking dissecting table so that the room was really rather a disappointment among the books was a tattered old copy of borellus in blackletter and it was weirdly interesting to note that ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good mr merritt at curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before that older copy of course must have perished along with the rest of curwens occult library in the final raid three archways opened off the laboratory and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn from his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms but these he canvassed with care remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffinplates he could decipher there was much clothing also stored in these rooms and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate most interesting of all perhaps were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old joseph curwens laboratory appliances these had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the georgian periodthe third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps these lamps willett lighted and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him some of the upper levels were wholly vacant but most of the space was filled with small oddlooking leaden jars of two general types one tall and without handles like a grecian lekythos or oiljug and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a phaleron jug all had metal stoppers and were covered with peculiarlooking symbols moulded in low relief in a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading custodes above them and all the phalerons on the other correspondingly labelled with a sign reading materia each of the jars or jugs except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue and willett resolved to look for the latter presently for the moment however he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation the result was invariable both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull neutral colour to the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the phalerons a bluishgrey powder might be by the side of a pinkishwhite one and any one in a phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos the most individual feature about the powders was their nonadhesiveness willett would pour one into his hand and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palmthe meaning of the two signs puzzled him and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper custodes materia that was the latin for guards and materials respectivelyand then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word guards before in connexion with this dreadful mystery it was of course in the recent letter to dr allen purporting to be from old edward hutchinson and the phrase had read there was no neede to keep the guards in shape and eatg off their heads and it made much to be founde in case of trouble as you too welle knowe what did this signify but waitwas there not stillanotherreference to guards in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the hutchinson letter back in the old nonsecretive days ward had told him of the eleazar smith diary recording the spying of smith and weeden on the curwen farm and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth there had been smith and weeden insisted terrible colloquies wherein figured curwen certain captives of hisand the guards of those captivesthose guards according to hutchinson or his avatar had eaten their heads off so that now dr allen did not keep themin shapeand if notin shapehow save as the salts to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they couldsothatwas what these lekythoi contained the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help when called up by some hellish incantation in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels then he thought of the materiain the myriad phaleron jugs on the other side of the room salts tooand if not the salts of guards then the salts of what god could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern as poor charles had hinted in his frantic note all civilisation all natural law perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe and marinus bicknell willett had sifted their dust through his handsthen he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above it was only a symbol but it filled him with vague spiritual dread for a morbid dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep it was the sign of koth that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilightand willett did not like what his friend randolph carter had said of its powers but a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stenchfilled air this was a chemical rather than animal smell and came clearly from the room beyond the door and it was unmistakably the same odour which had saturated charles wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away so it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons he was wiser than old joseph curwen for he had not resisted willett boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold a wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition there was nothing alive here to harm him and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patientthe room beyond the door was of medium size and had no furniture save a table a single chair and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels which willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture on one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like grecian kylikes on the other side was the table with a powerful argand lamp a pad and pencil and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad to see what notes young ward might have been jotting down when interrupted but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed curwen chirography which shed no light on the case as a wholeb dyd not escapd into walls and founde place belowsaw olde v saye yesabaoth and learnt yewayraisdyogsothoththrice and was yenexte day deliverdf soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise those from outsideas the strong argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapelesslooking robes of a rather dismal yellowishwhite but far more interesting were the two vacant walls both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone the damp floor also bore marks of carving and with but little difficulty willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner in one of these four circles near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whiprack and just outside the periphery was one of the phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room its tag numbered 118 this was unstoppered and proved upon inspection to be empty but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not within its shallow area and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern lay a small amount of a dry dullgreenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug and willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene the whips and the instruments of torture the dust or salts from the jug of materia the two lekythoi from the custodes shelf the robes the formulae on the walls the notes on the pad the hints from letters and legends and the thousand glimpses doubts and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of charles wardall these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floorwith an effort however willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls from the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in joseph curwens time and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic one the doctor clearly recognised as what mrs ward heard her son chanting on that ominous good friday a year before and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres it was not spelled here exactly as mrs ward had set it down from memory nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of eliphas levi but its identity was unmistakable and such words assabaoth metraton almousinandzariatnatmiksent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the cornerthis was on the lefthand wall as one entered the room the righthand wall was no less thickly inscribed and willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library they were roughly speaking the same with the ancient symbols of dragons head and dragons tail heading them as in wards scribblings but the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions as if old curwen had had a different way of recording sound or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question the doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head and found it hard to do where the script he had memorised beganyai ngngah yogsothoththis epigraph started out asaye engengah yoggesothothawhich to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second wordground as the later text was into his consciousness the discrepancy disturbed him and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice its accents keyed to a droning singsong either through the spell of the past and the unknown or through the hellish example of that dull godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darknessyai ngngahyogsothothheelgebfai throdoguaaahbut what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant the lamps were sputtering woefully and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight there was smoke too and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the faraway wells an odour like that he had smelt before yet infinitely stronger and more pungent he turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents and saw that the kylix on the floor in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain was giving forth a cloud of thick greenishblack vapour of surprising volume and opacity that powdergreat god it had come from the shelf of materiawhat was it doing now and what had started it the formula he had been chantingthe first of the pairdragons headascending nodeblessed saviour could it be the doctor reeled and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen heard and read of the frightful case of joseph curwen and charles dexter ward i say to you againe doe not call up any that you can not put downe have yewordes for laying at all times readie and stopp not to be sure when there is any doubte ofwhomyou have three talkes withwhat was therein inhumd mercy of heaven what is that shape behind the parting smoke5marinus bicknell willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old he has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance but mr ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar did not willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening and again the next day and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs willett had been breathing stertorously and opened his eyes slowly when mr ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car then he shuddered and screamed crying outthat beard those eyes god who are youa very strange thing to say to a trim blueeyed cleanshaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhoodin the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees and only a faint acrid odour reminded mr ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital the doctors flashlight was missing but his valise was safely there as empty as when he had brought it before indulging in any explanations and obviously with great moral effort willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs it was unyielding crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one underneath the smooth concrete was still visible but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs only the smooth concrete underneath the planksno noisome well no world of subterrene horrors no secret library no curwen papers no nightmare pits of stench and howling no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae no dr willett turned pale and clutched at the younger man yesterday he asked softly did you see it here and smell it and when mr ward himself transfixed with dread and wonder found strength to nod an affirmative the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp and nodded in turn then i will tell you he saidso for an hour in the sunniest room they could find upstairs the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father there was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenishblack vapour from the kylix parted and willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred there were futile bewildered headshakings from both men and once mr ward ventured a hushed suggestion do you suppose it would be of any use to dig the doctor was silent for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the great abyss again mr ward asked but where did it go it brought you here you know and it sealed up the hole somehow and willett again let silence answer for himbut after all this was not the final phase of the matter reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave dr willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault it was a common sheet torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencildoubtless the one which had lain beside the pad it was folded very carelessly and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this but in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder for here was no script of any wholesome age but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar the briefly scrawled message was this and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair who forthwith walked steadily out to the ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the john hay library on the hillat the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier in the end they found what was needed the letters were indeed no fantastic invention but the normal script of a very dark period they were the pointed saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century ad and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily and the pale moon of britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the roman ruins of caerleon and hexham and by the towers along hadrians crumbling wall the words were in such latin as a barbarous age might remembercorvinus necandus est cadaver aqua forti dissolvendum nec aliquid retinendum tace ut poteswhich may roughly be translated curwen must be killed the body must be dissolved in aqua fortis nor must anything be retained keep silence as best you are ablewillett and mr ward were mute and baffled they had met the unknown and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought with willett especially the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was wellnigh exhausted and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave then they drove listlessly to the ward mansion in prospect street and talked to no purpose into the night the doctor rested toward morning but did not go home and he was still there sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up dr allenmr ward who was pacing nervously about in a dressinggown answered the call in person and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready both willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message it seemed certain that the curwen who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger charles had feared this man and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid allen moreover had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in europe under the name of curwen and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer and now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that curwen must be killed and dissolved in acid the linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious and besides was not allen planning to murder young ward upon the advice of the creature called hutchinson of course the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger but from its text they could see that allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish without doubt allen must be apprehended and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon charles wardthat afternoon hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young charles at the hospital simply and gravely willett told him all he had found and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery the physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could and watched for a wincing on charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within but ward did not wince willett paused and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving he taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply for charles having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him then he whispered in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used damn em theydoeat but theydont need tothats the rare part a month you say without food lud sir you be modest dye know that was the joke on poor old whipple with his virtuous bluster kill everything off would he why damme he was halfdeaf with the noise from outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells he never dreamed they were there at all devil take yethose cursed things have been howling down there ever since curwen was done for a hundred and fiftyseven years gonebut no more than this could willett get from the youth horrified yet almost convinced against his will he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained looking at the youths face the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought truly the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies when the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned charles shewed his first sign of animation a quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what willett had read on the pad and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic but he added had you but known the words to bring up that which i had out in the cup you had not been here to tell me this twas number 118 and i conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room twas never raised by me but i meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hitherthen willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenishblack smoke which had arisen and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on charles wards face itcameand you be here alive as ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance willett gifted with a flash of inspiration believed he saw the situation and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered no 118 you say but dont forget thatstones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten you are never sure till you questionand then without warning he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes he could have wished no stronger result for charles ward fainted forthwithall this conversation of course had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions unaided too dr willett and mr ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch in reviving the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to orne and hutchinson at once so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy and had given dr allen advice for his assassination this revelation produced no visible effect and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man after that he would converse no more so willett and the father departed presently leaving behind a caution against the bearded allen to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of and could do no one any harm even if he wished this was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear they did not worry about any communications charles might indite to that monstrous pair in europe since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outrlooking missivethere is however a curious sequel to the matter of orne and hutchinson if such indeed the exiled wizards were moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period willett arranged with an international presscutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in prague and in eastern transylvania and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated one was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of prague and the disappearance of the evil old man called josef nadek who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember the other was a titan explosion in the transylvanian mountains east of rakus and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the illregarded castle ferenczy whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well and that while curwen was left to him to dispose of the writer felt able to find and deal with orne and hutchinson itself of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think6the following morning dr willett hastened to the ward home to be present when the detectives arrived allens destruction or imprisonmentor curwens if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as validhe felt must be accomplished at any cost and he communicated this conviction to mr ward as they sat waiting for the men to come they were downstairs this time for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished curwen portraitat nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say they had not regrettably enough located the brava tony gomes as they had wished nor had they found the least trace of dr allens source or present whereabouts but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger allen had struck pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being and there was an universal belief that his thick vandyke beard was either dyed or falsea belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard together with a pair of dark glasses in his room at the fateful bungalow his voice mr ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and hornrimmed glasses one shopkeeper in the course of negotiations had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant in connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer a majority of the gossips believed that allen rather than ward was the actual vampire statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery they had felt less of the sinister in dr allen but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage the place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly but they would know him again if they saw him his beard had looked odd and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye as for the detectives search of allens room it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young ward found in the vanished catacombs of horrordr willett and mr ward caught something of a profound subtle and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded and almost trembled in following up the vague mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds the false beard and glassesthe crabbed curwen penmanshipthe old portrait and its tiny scarand the altered youth in the hospital with such a scarthat deep hollow voice on the telephonewas it not of this that mr ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced who had ever seen charles and allen together yes the officials had once but who later on was it not when allen left that charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow curwenallenwardin what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved that damnable resemblance of the picture to charleshad it not used to stare and stare and follow the boy around the room with its eyes why too did both allen and charles copy joseph curwens handwriting even when alone and off guard and then the frightful work of those peoplethe lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight the starved monsters in the noisome pits the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results the message in minuscules found in willetts pocket the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and salts and discoverieswhither did everything lead in the end mr ward did the most sensible thing steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous dr allen that article was a photograph of his luckless son on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from allens roomfor two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered then the men returned yesthe altered photograph was a very passable likeness of dr allenmr ward turned pale and willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief allenwardcurwenit was becoming too hideous for coherent thought what had the boy called out of the void and what had it done to him what really had happened from first to last who was this allen who sought to kill charles as too squeamish and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid why too had the minuscule message of whose origin no one dared think said that curwen must be likewise obliterated what was thechangeand when had the final stage occurred that day when his frantic note was receivedhe had been nervous all the morning then there was an alteration he had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him that was the time when he was out but nohad he not cried out in terror as he entered his studythis very room what had he found there or waitwhat had found himthat simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to gowas that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all had not the butler spoken of queer noiseswillett rang for the man and asked him some lowtoned questions it had surely enough been a bad business there had been noisesa cry a gasp a choking and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping or all of these and mr charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word the butler shivered as he spoke and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs terror had settled definitely upon the house and only the businesslike detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it even they were restless for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all dr willett was thinking deeply and rapidly and his thoughts were terrible ones now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new appalling and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happeningsthen mr ward made a sign that the conference was over and everyone save him and the doctor left the room it was noon now but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantomhaunted mansion willett began talking very seriously to his host and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him there would be he predicted certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative as family physician he must have a free hand and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when joseph curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panelmr ward dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side could only acquiesce and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from olney court the father listening outside heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed and finally a wrench and a creak as if a tight cupboard door were being opened then there was a muffled cry a kind of snorting choke and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened almost at once the key rattled and willett appeared in the hall haggard and ghastly and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room the furnace was not enough he said and the electric log had little practical use longing yet not daring to ask questions mr ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the july before they were in a covered basket and mr ward never saw what they werethen the doctor locked himself in the library once more and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire later after a great rustling of newspapers that odd wrench and creaking were heard again followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked thereafter two suppressed cries of willetts were heard and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes mr wards head reeled and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down after an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten and halfformless sounds of scraping sweeping and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door and at last after the slamming of some cupboard within willett made his appearancesad pale and haggard and bearing the clothdraped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory he had left the window open and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants the ancient overmantel still lingered but it seemed robbed of malignity now and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of joseph curwen night was coming on yet this time its shadows held no latent fright but only a gentle melancholy of what he had done the doctor would never speak to mr ward he said i can answer no questions but i will say that there are different kinds of magic i have made a great purgation and those in this house will sleep the better for it7that dr willetts purgation had been an ordeal almost as nerveracking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening for three days he rested constantly in his room though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on wednesday when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness servants imaginations fortunately are limited else comment might have been excited by an item in thursdaysevening bulletinwhich ran as followsnorth end ghoulsactive againafter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the weeden lot at the north burial ground a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by robert hart the night watchman happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 am hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light at once starting in pursuit he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possiblelike the first of the ghouls active during the past year this intruder had done no real damage before detection a vacant part of the ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted and no previous grave had been disturbedhart who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source but police from the second station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shatteredthe first of the incidents in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated occurred a year ago last march and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache it is possible says sergt riley that this third affair is of similar nature officers at the second station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outragesall day thursday dr willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come in the evening he wrote a note to mr ward which was delivered the next morning and which caused the halfdazed parent to ponder long and deeply mr ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of monday with its baffling reports and its sinister purgation but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke10 barnes stprovidence riapril 12 1928dear theodorei feel that i must say a word to you before doing what i am going to do tomorrow it will conclude the terrible business we have been going through for i feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of but im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless i expressly assure you how very conclusive it isyou have known me ever since you were a small boy so i think you will not distrust me when i hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored it is better that you attempt no further speculation as to charless case and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects when i call on you tomorrow charles will have escaped that is all which need remain in anyones mind he was mad and he escaped you can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name id advise you to join her in atlantic city and take a rest yourself god knows you need one after this shock as i do myself i am going south for a while to calm down and brace upso dont ask me any questions when i call it may be that something will go wrong but ill tell you if it does i dont think it will there will be nothing more to worry about for charles will be very very safe he is nowsafer than you dream you need hold no fears about allen and who or what he is he forms as much a part of the past as joseph curwens picture and when i ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person and what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yoursbut you must steel yourself to melancholy and prepare your wife to do the same i must tell you frankly that charless escape will not mean his restoration to you he has been afflicted with a peculiar disease as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him and you must not hope to see him again have only this consolationthat he was never a fiend or even truly a madman but only an eager studious and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing he stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach and something came out of those years to engulf himand now comes the matter in which i must ask you to trust me most of all for there will be indeed no uncertainty about charless fate in about a year say you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end for the boy will be no more you can put up a stone in your lot at the north burial ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way and that will mark the true restingplace of your son nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling the ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinewof the real charles dexter ward whose mind you watched from infancythe real charles with the olivemark on his hip and without the black witchmark on his chest or the pit on his forehead the charles who never did actual evil and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishnessthat is all charles will have escaped and a year from now you can put up his stone do not question me tomorrow and believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now as it has been at all times in the pastwith profoundest sympathy and exhortations to fortitude calmness and resignation i am eversincerely your friendmarinus b willettso on the morning of friday april 13 1928 marinus bicknell willett visited the room of charles dexter ward at dr waites private hospital on conanicut island the youth though making no attempt to evade his caller was in a sullen mood and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which willett obviously desired the doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities then a new element of constraint crept in as ward seemed to read behind the doctors masklike face a terrible purpose which had never been there before the patient quailed conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avengerward actually turned pale and the doctor was the first to speak more he said has been found out and i must warn you fairly that a reckoning is duedigging again and coming upon more poor starving pets was the ironic reply it was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the lastno willett slowly rejoined this time i did not have to dig we have had men looking up dr allen and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalowexcellent commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting and i trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have onthey would become you very well came the even and studied responseas indeed they seem to have doneas willett said this it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun though there was no change in the shadows on the floor then ward venturedand is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofoldno said willett gravely again you are wrong it is no business of mine if any man seeks dualityprovided he has any right to exist at all and provided he does not destroy what called him out of spaceward now started violently well sir whathaveye found and what dye want with methe doctor let a little time elapse before replying as if choosing his words for an effective answeri have found he finally intoned something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was and i have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of charles dexter ward ought to bethe madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sittingdamn ye who did ye telland wholl believe it was he after these full two months with me alive what dye mean to dowillett though a small man actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesturei have told no one this is no common caseit is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with thank god some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination that i might not go astray in thinking out this thingyou cannot deceive me joseph curwen for i know that your accursed magic is truei know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant i know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave i know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him i know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombsand at what you planned afterwardand i know how you did ityou left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house they thought it was he who went in and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him but you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds you were a fool curwen to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting it hasnt worked you see after all you know better than i who or what wrote that message in minuscules but i will warn you it was not written in vain there are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out and i believe that the writer of those words will attend to orne and hutchinson one of those creatures wrote you once do not call up any that you can not put down you were undone once before perhaps in that very way and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again curwen a man cant tamper with nature beyond certain limits and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you outbut here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him hopelessly at bay weaponless and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue joseph curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep hollow voice now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formulaper adonai eloim adonai jehova adonai sabaoth metraton but willett was too quick for him even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite an eye for an eyemagic for magiclet the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned so in a clear voice marinus bicknell willett began thesecondof that pair of formulae whose

could be pronouncedbut he did not faint and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again the madness out of time had subsided and the case of charles dexter ward was closed opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror dr willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss there had as he had predicted been no need for acids for like his accursed picture a year before joseph curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluishgrey dust,1
it is said that in ulthar which lies beyond the river skai no man may kill a cat and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire for the cat is cryptic and close to strange things which men cannot see he is the soul of antique aegyptus and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in mero and ophir he is the kin of the jungles lords and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa the sphinx is his cousin and he speaks her language but he is more ancient than the sphinx and remembers that which she hath forgottenin ulthar before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours why they did this i know not save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight but whatever the reason this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel and from some of the sounds heard after dark many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard in truth much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk they feared them more and instead of berating them as brutal assassins merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed and sounds heard after dark the loser would lament impotently or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished for the people of ulthar were simple and knew not whence it is all cats first cameone day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar dark wanderers they were and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year in the marketplace they told fortunes for silver and bought gay beads from the merchants what was the land of these wanderers none could tell but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats hawks rams and lions and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the hornsthere was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother but only a tiny black kitten to cherish the plague had not been kind to him yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow and when one is very young one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sate playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagonon the third morning of the wanderers stay in ulthar menes could not find his kitten and as he sobbed aloud in the marketplace certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife and of sounds heard in the night and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation and finally to prayer he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming it was very peculiar but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy nebulous figures of exotic things of hybrid creatures crowned with hornflanked discs nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginativethat night the wanderers left ulthar and were never seen again and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished cats large and small black grey striped yellow and white old kranon the burgomaster swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes kitten and cursed the caravan and the little boy but nith the lean notary declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold still no one durst complain to the sinister couple even when little atal the innkeepers son vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage two abreast as if in performance of some unheardof rite of beasts the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yardso ulthar went to sleep in vain anger and when the people awaked at dawnbehold every cat was back at his accustomed hearth large and small black grey striped yellow and white none was missing very sleek and fat did the cats appear and sonorous with purring content the citizens talked with one another of the affair and marvelled not a little old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious and for two whole days the sleek lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food but only doze by the fire or in the sunit was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy cornersthere was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar zath the coroner disputed at length with nith the lean notary and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions even little atal the innkeepers son was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward they talked of the old cotter and his wife of the caravan of dark wanderers of small menes and his black kitten of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yardand in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travellers in nir namely that in ulthar no man may kill a cat,1
in a dream kuranes saw the city in the valley and the seacoast beyond and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward the distant regions where the sea meets the sky in a dream it was also that he came by his name of kuranes for when awake he was called by another name perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name for he was the last of his family and alone among the indifferent millions of london so there were not many to speak to him and remind him who he had been his money and lands were gone and he did not care for the ways of people about him but preferred to dream and write of his dreams what he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he shewed it so that after a time he kept his writings to himself and finally ceased to write the more he withdrew from the world about him the more wonderful became his dreams and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper kuranes was not modern and did not think like others who wrote whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality kuranes sought for beauty alone when truth and experience failed to reveal it he sought it in fancy and illusion and found it on his very doorstep amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and dreamsthere are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth for when as children we listen and dream we think but halfformed thoughts and when as men we try to remember we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life but some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens of fountains that sing in the sun of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas of plains that stretch down to sleeping cities of bronze and stone and of shadowy companies of heroes that ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests and then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappykuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood he had been dreaming of the house where he was born the great stone house covered with ivy where thirteen generations of his ancestors had lived and where he had hoped to die it was moonlight and he had stolen out into the fragrant summer night through the gardens down the terraces past the great oaks of the park and along the long white road to the village the village seemed very old eaten away at the edge like the moon which had commenced to wane and kuranes wondered whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death in the streets were spears of long grass and the windowpanes on either side were either broken or filmily staring kuranes had not lingered but had plodded on as though summoned toward some goal he dared not disobey the summons for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life which do not lead to any goal then he had been drawn down a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs and had come to the end of thingsto the precipice and the abyss where all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing emptiness of infinity and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit by the crumbling moon and the peering stars faith had urged him on over the precipice and into the gulf where he had floated down down down past dark shapeless undreamed dreams faintly glowing spheres that may have been partly dreamed dreams and laughing winged things that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds then a rift seemed to open in the darkness before him and he saw the city of the valley glistening radiantly far far below with a background of sea and sky and a snowcapped mountain near the shorekuranes had awaked the very moment he beheld the city yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephas in the valley of oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm seabreeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village he had protested then when they had found him waked him and carried him home for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky and now he was equally resentful of awaking for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary yearsbut three nights afterward kuranes came again to celephas as before he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead and of the abyss down which one must float silently then the rift appeared again and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour and watched the gingko trees of mount aran swaying in the seabreeze but this time he was not snatched away and like a winged being settled gradually over a grassy hillside till finally his feet rested gently on the turf he had indeed come back to the valley of oothnargai and the splendid city of celephasdown the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked kuranes over the bubbling naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he had carved his name so many years ago and through the whispering grove to the great stone bridge by the city gate all was as of old nor were the marble walls discoloured nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished and kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he knew be vanished for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same and still as young as he remembered them when he entered the city past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements the merchants and cameldrivers greeted him as if he had never been away and it was the same at the turquoise temple of nathhorthath where the orchidwreathed priests told him that there is no time in oothnargai but only perpetual youth then kuranes walked through the street of pillars to the seaward wall where gathered the traders and sailors and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky there he stayed long gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun and where rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the skymore than ever kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he had heard so many strange tales and he sought again the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago he found the man athib sitting on the same chest of spices he had sat upon before and athib seemed not to realise that any time had passed then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour and giving orders to the oarsmen commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenerian sea that leads to the sky for several days they glided undulatingly over the water till finally they came to the horizon where the sea meets the sky here the galley paused not at all but floated easily in the blue of the sky among fleecy clouds tinted with rose and far beneath the keel kuranes could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or disappear at length athib told him that their journey was near its end and that they would soon enter the harbour of serannian the pink marble city of the clouds which is built on that ethereal coast where the west wind flows into the sky but as the highest of the citys carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space and kuranes awaked in his london garretfor many months after that kuranes sought the marvellous city of celephas and its skybound galleys in vain and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and unheardof places no one whom he met could tell him how to find oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills one night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint lone campfires at great distances apart and strange shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders and in the wildest part of this hilly country so remote that few men could ever have seen it he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers green foliage and lawns white paths diamond brooks blue lakelets carven bridges and redroofed pagodas that he for a moment forgot celephas in sheer delight but he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a redroofed pagoda and would have questioned the people of that land about it had he not found that there were no people there but only birds and bees and butterflies on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon and in the silent city that spread away from the riverbank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before he would have descended and asked the way to oothnargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city and the stagnation of the reedy river and the death lying upon that land as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the godsso kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of celephas and its galleys that sail to serannian in the sky meanwhile seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery on the cold desert plateau of leng in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep hasheesh helped a great deal and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence and a violetcoloured gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had called infinity the gas had not heard of planets and organisms before but identified kuranes merely as one from the infinity where matter energy and gravitation exist kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaretstudded celephas and increased his doses of drugs but eventually he had no more money left and could buy no drugs then one summer day he was turned out of his garret and wandered aimlessly through the streets drifting over a bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner and it was there that fulfilment came and he met the cortege of knights come from celephas to bear him thither foreverhandsome knights they were astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of clothofgold curiously emblazoned so numerous were they that kuranes almost mistook them for an army but their leader told him they were sent in his honour since it was he who had created oothnargai in his dreams on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore then they gave kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade and all rode majestically through the downs of surrey and onward toward the region where kuranes and his ancestors were born it was very strange but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through time for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villages as chaucer or men before him might have seen and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers when it grew dark they travelled more swiftly till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air in the dim dawn they came upon the village which kuranes had seen alive in his childhood and asleep or dead in his dreams it was alive now and early villagers courtesied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dream kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night and wondered what it would look like by day so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies the abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations endlessly down the horsemen floated their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness the brightness of the city celephas and the seacoast beyond and the snowy peak overlooking the sea and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the skyand kuranes reigned thereafter over oothnargai and all the neighbouring regions of dream and held his court alternately in celephas and in the cloudfashioned serannian he reigns there still and will reign happily forever though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the halfdeserted village at dawn played mockingly and cast it upon the rocks by ivycovered trevor towers where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility,1
cl mooregeorge campbell opened sleepfogged eyes upon darkness and lay gazing out of the tent flap upon the pale august night for some minutes before he roused enough even to wonder what had wakened him there was in the keen clear air of these canadian woods a soporific as potent as any drug campbell lay quiet for a moment sinking slowly back into the delicious borderlands of sleep conscious of an exquisite weariness an unaccustomed sense of muscles well used and relaxed now into perfect ease these were vacations most delightful moments after allrest after toil in the clear sweet forest nightluxuriously as his mind sank backward into oblivion he assured himself once more that three long months of freedom lay before himfreedom from cities and monotony freedom from pedagogy and the university and students with no rudiments of interest in the geology he earned his daily bread by dinning into their obdurate ears freedom fromabruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him somewhere outside the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed into his peace george campbell sat up jerkily and reached for his flashlight then he laughed and put it down again straining his eyes through the midnight gloom outside where among the tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous little night beast was prowling he stretched out a long arm and groped about among the rocks at the tent door for a missile his fingers closed on a large stone and he drew back his hand to throwbut he never threw it it was such a queer thing he had come upon in the dark square crystal smooth obviously artificial with dull rounded corners the strangeness of its rock surfaces to his fingers was so remarkable that he reached again for his flashlight and turned its rays upon the thing he heldall sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up in his idle groping it was clear as rock crystal this queer smooth cube quartz unquestionably but not in its usual hexagonal crystallized form somehowhe could not guess the methodit had been wrought into a perfect cube about four inches in measurement over each worn face for it was incredibly worn the hard hard crystal was rounded now until its corners were almost gone and the thing was beginning to assume the outlines of a sphere ages and ages of wearing years almost beyond counting must have passed over this strange clear thingbut the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make out dimly in the heart of the crystal for imbedded in its center lay a little disc of a pale and nameless substance with characters incised deep upon its quartzenclosed surface wedgeshaped characters faintly reminiscent of cuneiform writinggeorge campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the little enigma in his hands puzzling helplessly how could such a thing as this have imbedded in pure rock crystal remotely a memory floated through his mind of ancient legends that called quartz crystals ice which had frozen too hard to melt again iceand wedgeshaped cuneiformsyes didnt that sort of writing originate among the sumerians who came down from the north in historys remotest beginnings to settle in the primitive mesopotamian valley then hard sense regained control and he laughed quartz of course was formed in the earliest of earths geological periods when there was nothing anywhere but heat and heaving rock ice had not come for tens of millions of years after this thing must have been formedand yetthat writing manmade surely although its characters were unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at cuneiform shapes or could there in a paleozoic world have been things with a written language who might have graven these cryptic wedges upon the quartzenveloped disc he held ormight a thing like this have fallen meteorlike out of space into the unformed rock of a still molten world could itthen he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot at the luridness of his own imagination the silence and the solitude and the queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play tricks with his common sense he shrugged and laid the crystal down at the edge of his pallet switching off the light perhaps morning and a clear head would bring him an answer to the questions that seemed so insoluble nowbut sleep did not come easily for one thing it seemed to him as he flashed off the light that the little cube had shone for a moment as if with sustained light before it faded into the surrounding dark or perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had been only his dazzled eyes that seemed to see the light forsake it reluctantly glowing in the enigmatic deeps of the thing with queer persistencehe lay there unquietly for a long while turning the unanswered questions over and over in his mind there was something about this crystal cube out of the unmeasured past perhaps from the dawn of all history that constituted a challenge that would not let him sleepa merritthe lay there it seemed to him for hours it had been the lingering light the luminescence that seemed so reluctant to die which held his mind it was as though something in the heart of the cube had awakened stirred drowsily become suddenly alert and intent upon himsheer fantasy this he stirred impatiently and flashed his light upon his watch close to one oclock three hours more before the dawn the beam fell and was focused upon the warm crystal cube he held it there closely for minutes he snapped it out then watchedthere was no doubt about it now as his eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness he saw that the strange crystal was glimmering with tiny fugitive lights deep within it like threads of sapphire lightnings they were at its center and they seemed to him to come from the pale disk with its disturbing markings and the disc itself was becoming larger the markings shifting shapes the cube was growing was it illusion brought about by the tiny lightnings he heard a sound it was the very ghost of a sound like the ghosts of harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers he bent closer it came from the cube there was squeaking in the underbrush a flurry of bodies and an agonized wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly stilled some small tragedy of the wilderness killer and prey he stepped over to where it had been enacted but could see nothing he again snapped off the flash and looked toward his tent upon the ground was a pale blue glimmering it was the cube he stooped to pick it up then obeying some obscure warning drew back his handand again he saw its glow was dying the tiny sapphire lightnings flashing fitfully withdrawing to the disc from which they had come there was no sound from ithe sat watching the luminescence glow and fade glow and fade but steadily becoming dimmer it came to him that two elements were necessary to produce the phenomenon the electric ray itself and his own fixed attention his mind must travel along the ray fix itself upon the cubes heart if its beat were to wax until whathe felt a chill of spirit as though from contact with some alien thing it was alien he knew it not of this earth not of earths life he conquered his shrinking picked up the cube and took it into the tent it was neither warm nor cold except for its weight he would not have known he held it he put it upon the table keeping the torch turned from it then stepped to the flap of the tent and closed ithe went back to the table drew up the camp chair and turned the flash directly upon the cube focusing it so far as he could upon its heart he sent all his will all his concentration along it focusing will and sight upon the disc as he had the lightas though at command the sapphire lightnings burned forth they burst from the disc into the body of the crystal cube then beat back bathing the disc and the markings again these began to change shifting moving advancing and retreating in the blue gleaming they were no longer cuneiform they were things objectshe heard the murmuring music the plucked harp strings louder grew the sound and louder and now all the body of the cube vibrated to their rhythm the crystal walls were melting growing misty as though formed of the mist of diamonds and the disc itself was growing the shapes shifting dividing and multiplying as though some door had been opened and into it companies of phantasms were pouring while brighter more bright grew the pulsing lighthe felt swift panic tried to withdraw sight and will dropped the flash the cube had no need now of the ray and he could not withdraw could not withdraw why he himself was being sucked into that disc which was now a globe within which unnameable shapes danced to a music that bathed the globe with steady radiancethere was no tent there was only a vast curtain of sparkling mist behind which shone the globe he felt himself drawn through that mist sucked through it as if by a mighty wind straight for the globeh p lovecraftas the mistblurred light of the sapphire suns grew more and more intense the outlines of the globe ahead wavered and dissolved to a churning chaos its pallor and its motion and its music all blended themselves with the engulfing mistbleaching it to a pale steelcolour and setting it undulantly in motion and the sapphire suns too melted imperceptibly into the greying infinity of shapeless pulsationmeanwhile the sense of forward outward motion grew intolerably incredibly cosmically swift every standard of speed known to earth seemed dwarfed and campbell knew that any such flight in physical reality would mean instant death to a human being even as it wasin this strange hellish hypnosis or nightmarethe quasivisual impression of meteorlike hurtling almost paralyzed his mind though there were no real points of reference in the grey pulsing void he felt that he was approaching and passing the speed of light itself finally his consciousness did go underand merciful blackness swallowed everythingit was very suddenly and amidst the most impenetrable darkness that thoughts and ideas again came to george campbell of how many momentsor yearsor eternitieshad elapsed since his flight through the grey void he could form no estimate he knew only that he seemed to be at rest and without pain indeed the absence of all physical sensation was the salient quality of his condition it made even the blackness seem less solidly blacksuggesting as it did that he was rather a disembodied intelligence in a state beyond physical senses than a corporeal being with senses deprived of their accustomed objects of perception he could think sharply and quicklyalmost preternaturally soyet could form no idea whatsoever of his situationhalf by instinct he realised that he was not in his own tent true he might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world equally black yet he knew this was not so there was no camp cot beneath himhe had no hands to feel the blankets and canvas surface and flashlight that ought to be around himthere was no sensation of cold in the airno flap through which he could glimpse the pale night outside something was wrong dreadfully wronghe cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube which had hypnotised himof that and all which had followed he had known that his mind was going yet had been unable to draw back at the last moment there had been a shocking panic feara subconscious fear beyond even that caused by the sensation of daemonic flight it had come from some vague flash or remote recollectionjust what he could not at once tell some cellgroup in the back of his head had seemed to find a cloudily familiar quality in the cubeand that familiarity was fraught with dim terror now he tried to remember what the familiarity and the terror werelittle by little it came to him oncelong ago in connection with his geological lifeworkhe had read of something like that cube it had to do with those debatable and disquieting clay fragments called the eltdown shards dug up from precarboniferous strata in southern england thirty years before their shape and markings were so queer that a few scholars hinted at artificiality and made wild conjectures about them and their origin they came clearly from a time when no human beings could exist on the globebut their contours and figurings were damnably puzzling that was how they got their nameit was not however in the writings of any sober scientist that campbell had seen that reference to a crystal discholding globe the source was far less reputable and infinitely more vivid about 1912 a deeply learned sussex clergyman of occultist leaningsthe reverend arthur brooke wintershallhad professed to identify the markings on the eltdown shards with some of the socalled prehuman hieroglyphs persistently cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical circles and had published at his own expense what purported to be a translation of the primal and baffling inscriptionsa translation still quoted frequently and seriously by occult writers in this translationa surprisingly long brochure in view of the limited number of shards existinghad occurred the narrative supposedly of prehuman authorship containing the now frightening referenceas the story went there dwelt on a worldand eventually on countless other worldsof outer space a mighty order of wormlike beings whose attainments and whose control of nature surpassed anything within the range of terrestrial imagination they had mastered the art of interstellar travel early in their career and had peopled every habitable planet in their own galaxykilling off the races they foundbeyond the limits of their own galaxywhich was not oursthey could not navigate in person but in their quest for knowledge of all space and time they discovered a means of spanning certain transgalactic gulfs with their minds they devised peculiar objectsstrangely energized cubes of a curious crystal containing hypnotic talismen and enclosed in spaceresisting spherical envelopes of an unknown substancewhich could be forcibly expelled beyond the limits of their universe and which would respond to the attraction of cool solid matter onlythese of which a few would necessarily land on various inhabited worlds in outside universes formed the etherbridges needed for mental communication atmospheric friction burned away the protecting envelope leaving the cube exposed and subject to discovery by the intelligent minds of the world where it fell by its very nature the cube would attract and rivet attention this when coupled with the action of light was sufficient to set its special properties workingthe mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the power of the disc and would be

cube was attuned the captured mind would remain suspended without body or senses until examined by one of the dominant race then it would by an obscure process of interchange be pumped of all its contents the investigators mind would now occupy the strange machine while the captive mind occupied the interrogators wormlike body then in another interchange the interrogators mind would leap across boundless space to the captives vacant and unconscious body on the transgalactic worldanimating the alien tenement as best it might and exploring the alien world in the guise of one of its denizenswhen done with exploration the adventurer would use the cube and its disc in accomplishing his returnand sometimes the captured mind would be restored safely to its own remote world not always however was the dominant race so kind sometimes when a potentially important race capable of space travel was found the wormlike folk would employ the cube to capture and annihilate minds by the thousands and would extirpate the race for diplomatic reasonsusing the exploring minds as agents of destructionin other cases sections of the wormfolk would permanently occupy a transgalactic planetdestroying the captured minds and wiping out the remaining inhabitants preparatory to settling down in unfamiliar bodies never however could the parent civilization be quite duplicated in such a case since the new planet would not contain all the materials necessary for the wormraces arts the cubes for example could be made only on the home planetonly a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a landing and response on an inhabited worldsince there was no such thing asaimingthem at goals beyond sight or knowledge only three ran the story had ever landed on peopled worlds in our own particular universe one of these had struck a planet near the galactic rim two thousand billion years ago while another had lodged three billion years ago on a world near the centre of the galaxy the thirdand the only one ever known to have invaded the solar systemhad reached our own earth 150000000 years agoit was with this latter that dr wintershalls translation chiefly dealt when the cube struck the earth he wrote the ruling terrestrial species was a huge coneshaped race surpassing all others before or since in mentality and achievements this race was so advanced that it had actually sent minds abroad in both space and time to explore the cosmos hence recognised something of what had happened when the cube fell from the sky and certain individuals had suffered mental change after gazing at itrealising that the changed individuals represented invading minds the races leaders had them destroyedeven at the cost of leaving the displaced minds exiled in alien space they had had experience with even stranger transitions when through a mental exploration of space and time they formed a rough idea of what the cube was they carefully hid the thing from light and sight and guarded it as a menace they did not wish to destroy a thing so rich in later experimental possibilities now and then some rash unscrupulous adventurer would furtively gain access to it and sample its perilous powers despite the consequencesbut all such cases were discovered and safely and drastically dealt withof this evil meddling the only bad result was that the wormlike outside race learned from the new exiles what had happened to their explorers on earth and conceived a violent hatred of the planet and all its lifeforms they would have depopulated it if they could and indeed sent additional cubes into space in the wild hope of striking it by accident in unguarded placesbut that accident never came to passthe coneshaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube in a special shrine as a relique and basis for experiments till after aeons it was lost amidst the chaos of war and the destruction of the great polar city where it was guarded when fifty million years ago the beings sent their minds ahead into the infinite future to avoid a nameless peril of inner earth the whereabouts of the sinister cube from space were unknownthis much according to the learned occultist the eltdown shards had said what now made the account so obscurely frightful to campbell was the minute accuracy with which the alien cube had been described every detail tallieddimensions consistency hieroglyphed central disc hypnotic effects as he thought the matter over and over amidst the darkness of his strange situation he began to wonder whether his whole experience with the crystal cubeindeed its very existencewere not a nightmare brought on by some freakish subconscious memory of this old bit of extravagant charlatanic reading if so though the nightmare must still be in force since his present apparently bodiless state had nothing of normality in itof the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection campbell could form no estimate everything about his state was so unreal that ordinary dimensions and measurements became meaningless it seemed an eternity but perhaps it was not really long before the sudden interruption came what happened was as strange and inexplicable as the blackness it succeeded there was a sensationof the mind rather than of the bodyand all at once campbell felt his thoughts swept or sucked beyond his control in tumultuous and chaotic fashionmemories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly all that he knewall his personal background traditions experiences scholarship dreams ideas and inspirationswelled up abruptly and simultaneously with a dizzying speed and abundance which soon made him unable to keep track of any separate concept the parade of all his mental contents became an avalanche a cascade a vortex it was as horrible and vertiginous as his hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him finally it sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh oblivionanother measureless blankand then a slow trickle of sensation this time it was physical not mental sapphire light and a low rumble of distant sound there were tactile impressionshe could realise that he was lying at full length on something though there was a baffling strangeness about the feel of his posture he could not reconcile the pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlinesor with the outlines of the human form at all he tried to move his arms but found no definite response to the attempt instead there were little ineffectual nervous twitches all over the area which seemed to mark his bodyhe tried to open his eyes more widely but found himself unable to control their mechanism the sapphire light came in a diffused nebulous manner and could nowhere be voluntarily focussed into definiteness gradually though visual images began to trickle in curiously and indecisively the limits and qualities of vision were not those which he was used to but he could roughly correlate the sensation with what he had known as sight as this sensation gained some degree of stability campbell realised that he must still be in the throes of nightmarehe seemed to be in a room of considerable extentof medium height but with a large proportionate area on every sideand he could apparently see all four sides at oncewere high narrowish slits which seemed to serve as combined doors and windows there were singular low tables or pedestals but no furniture of normal nature and proportions through the slits streamed floods of sapphire light and beyond them could be mistily seen the sides and roofs of fantastic buildings like clustered cubes on the wallsin the vertical panels between the slitswere strange markings of an oddly disquieting character it was some time before campbell understood why they disturbed him sothen he saw that they were in repeated instances precisely like some of the hieroglyphs on the crystal cubes discthe actual nightmare element though was something more than this it began with the living thing which presently entered through one of the slits advancing deliberately toward him and bearing a metal box of bizarre proportions and glassy mirrorlike surfaces for this thing was nothing humannothing of earthnothing even of mans myths and dreams it was a gigantic palegrey worm or centipede as large around as a man and twice as long with a disclike apparently eyeless ciliafringed head bearing a purple central orifice it glided on its rear pairs of legs with its fore part raised verticallythe legs or at least two pairs of them serving as arms along its spinal ridge was a curious purple comb and a fanshaped tail of some grey membrane ended its grotesque bulk there was a ring of flexible red spikes around its neck and from the twistings of these came clicking twanging sounds in measured deliberate rhythmshere indeed was outr nightmare at its heightcapricious fantasy at its apex but even this vision of delirium was not what caused george campbell to lapse a third time into unconsciousness it took one more thingone final unbearable touchto do that as the nameless worm advanced with its glistening box the reclining man caught in the mirrorlike surface a glimpse of what should have been his own body yethorribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar sensationsit was not his own body at all that he saw reflected in the burnished metal it was instead the loathsome palegrey bulk of one of the great centipedesrobert e howardfrom that final lap of senselessness he emerged with a full understanding of his situation his mind was imprisoned in the body of a frightful native of an alien planet while somewhere on the other side of the universe his own body was housing the monsters personalityhe fought down an unreasoning horror judged from a cosmic standpoint why should his metamorphosis horrify him life and consciousness were the only realities in the universe form was unimportant his present body was hideous only according to terrestrial standards fear and revulsion were drowned in the excitement of titanic adventurewhat was his former body but a cloak eventually to be cast off at death anyway he had no sentimental illusions about the life from which he had been exiled what had it ever given him save toil poverty continual frustration and repression if this life before him offered no more at least it offered no less intuition told him it offered moremuch morewith the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its naked fundamentals he realized that he remembered with pleasure only the physical delights of his former life but he had long ago exhausted all the physical possibilities contained in that earthly body earth held no new thrills but in the possession of this new alien body he felt promises of strange exotic joysa lawless exultation rose in him he was a man without a world free of all conventions or inhibitions of earth or of this strange planet free of every artificial restraint in the universe he was a god with grim amusement he thought of his body moving in earths business and society with all the while an alien monster staring out of the windows that were george campbells eyes on people who would flee if they knewlet him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would earth and its races no longer had any meaning to george campbell there he had been one of a billion nonentities fixed in place by a mountainous accumulation of conventions laws and manners doomed to live and die in his sordid niche but in one blind bound he had soared above the commonplace this was not death but rebirththe birth of a fullgrown mentality with a newfound freedom that made little of physical captivity on yekubhe started yekub it was the name of this planet but how had he known then he knew as he knew the name of him whose body he occupiedtothe memory deep grooved in tothes brain was stirring in himshadows of the knowledge tothe had carved deep in the physical tissues of the brain they spoke dimly as implanted instincts to george campbell and his human consciousness seized them and translated them to show him the way not only to safety and freedom but to the power his soul stripped to its primitive impulses craved not as a slave would he dwell on yekub but as a king just as of old barbarians had sat on the throne of lordly empiresfor the first time he turned his attention to his surroundings he still lay on the couchlike thing in the midst of that fantastic room and the centipede man stood before him holding the polished metal object and clashing its neckspikes thus it spoke to him campbell knew and what it said he dimly understood through the implanted thought processes of tothe just as he knew the creature was yukth supreme lord of sciencebut campbell gave no heed for he had made his desperate plan a plan so alien to the ways of yekub that it was beyond yukths comprehension and caught him wholly unprepared yukth like campbell saw the sharppointed metal shard on a nearby table but to yukth it was only a scientific implement he did not even know it could be used as a weapon campbells earthly mind supplied the knowledge and the action that followed driving tothes body into movements no man of yekub had ever made beforecampbell snatched the pointed shard and struck ripping savagely upward yukth reared and toppled his entrails spilling on the floor in an instant campbell was streaking for a door his speed was amazing exhilarating first fulfillment of the promise of novel physical sensationsas he ran guided wholly by the instinctive knowledge implanted in tothes physical reflexes it was as if he were borne by a separate consciousness in his legs tothes body was bearing him along a route it had traversed ten thousand times when animated by tothes minddown a winding corridor he raced up a twisted stair through a carved door and the same instincts that had brought him there told him he had found what he sought he was in a circular room with a domed roof from which shone a livid blue light a strange structure rose in the middle of the rainbowhued floor tier on tier each of a separate vivid color the ultimate tier was a purple cone from the apex of which a blue smoky mist drifted upward to a sphere that poised in midaira sphere that shone like translucent ivorythis the deepgrooved memories of tothe told campbell was the god of yekub though why the people of yekub feared and worshipped it had been forgotten a million years a wormpriest stood between him and the altar which no hand of flesh had ever touched that it could be touched was a blasphemy that had never occurred to a man of yekub the wormpriest stood in frozen horror until campbells shard ripped the life out of himon his centipedelegs campbell clambered the tiered altar heedless of its sudden quiverings heedless of the change that was taking place in the floating sphere heedless of the smoke that now billowed out in blue clouds he was drunk with the feel of power he feared the superstitions of yekub no more than he feared those of earth with that globe in his hands he would be king of yekub the worm men would dare deny him nothing when he held their god as hostage he reached a hand for the ballno longer ivoryhued but red as blood frank belknap longout of the tent into the pale august night walked the body of george campbell it moved with a slow wavering gait between the bodies of enormous trees over a forest path strewed with sweet scented pine needles the air was crisp and cold the sky was an inverted bowl of frosted silver flecked with stardust and far to the north the aurora borealis splashed streamers of firethe head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to side from the corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of amber froth which fluttered in the night breeze he walked upright at first as a man would walk but gradually as the tent receded his posture altered his torso began almost imperceptibly to slant and his limbs to shortenin a faroff world of outer space the centipede creature that was george campbell clasped to its bosom a god whose lineaments were red as blood and ran with insectlike quiverings across a rainbowhued hall and out through massive portals into the bright glow of alien sunsweaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that suggested the awkward loping of a werebeast the body of george campbell was fulfilling a mindless destiny long clawtipped fingers dragged leaves from a carpet of odorous pine needles as it moved toward a wide expanse of gleaming waterin the faroff extragalactic world of the worm people george campbell moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry down long fernplanted avenues holding aloft the round red godthere was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the gleaming lake on earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in a body swayed by instinct human teeth sank into soft animal fur tore at black animal flesh a little silver fox sank its fangs in frantic retaliation into a furry human wrist and thrashed about in terror as its blood spurted slowly the body of george campbell arose its mouth splashed with fresh blood with upper limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of the lakeas the variform creature that was george campbell crawled between the black blocks of stone thousands of wormshapes prostrated themselves in the scintillating dust before it a godlike power seemed to emanate from its weaving body as it moved with a slow undulant motion toward a throne of spiritual empire transcending all the sovereignties of eartha trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth near the tent where the wormcreature dwelt in the body of george campbell came to the gleaming waters of the lake and discerned something dark floating there he had been lost in the woods all night and weariness enveloped him like a leaden cloak in the pale morning lightbut the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore moving to the edge of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out toward the floating bulk slowly he pulled it to the shorefar off in outer space the wormcreature holding the glowing red god ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation cassiopeia under an alien vault of hypersuns the great deity that he held aloft energized his worm tenement burning away in the white fire of a supermundane spirituality all animal drosson earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the blackened and hairy face of the drowned man it was a bestial face repulsively anthropoid in

slime from which it sprangthus spoke the round red god of yekub in a faroff segment of the spacetime continuum to george campbell as the latter with all human desire purged away sat on a throne and ruled an empire of worms more wisely kindly and benevolently than any man of earth had ever ruled an empire of men,1

west of arkham the hills rise wild and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut there are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight on the gentler slopes there are farms ancient and rocky with squat mosscoated cottages brooding eternally over old new england secrets in the lee of great ledges but these are all vacant now the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofsthe old folk have gone away and foreigners do not like to live there frenchcanadians have tried it italians have tried it and the poles have come and departed it is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled but because of something that is imagined the place is not good for the imagination and does not bring restful dreams at night it must be this which keeps the foreigners away for old ammi pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days ammi whose head has been a little queer for years is the only one who still remains or who ever talks of the strange days and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around arkhamthere was once a road over the hills and through the valleys that ran straight where the blasted heath is now but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun and the secrets of the strange days will be one with the deeps secrets one with the hidden lore of old ocean and all the mystery of primal earthwhen i went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me the place was evil they told me this in arkham and because that is a very old town full of witch legends i thought the evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through centuries the name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and theatrical and i wondered how it had come into the folklore of a puritan people then i saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for myself and ceased to wonder at anything besides its own elder mystery it was morning when i saw it but shadow lurked always there the trees grew too thickly and their trunks were too big for any healthy new england wood there was too much silence in the dim alleys between them and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decayin the open spaces mostly along the line of the old road there were little hillside farms sometimes with all the buildings standing sometimes with only one or two and sometimes with only a lone chimney or fastfilling cellar weeds and briers reigned and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth upon everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression a touch of the unreal and the grotesque as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry i did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay for this was no region to sleep in it was too much like a landscape of salvator rosa too much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terrorbut even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath i knew it the moment i came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley for no other name could fit such a thing or any other thing fit such a name it was as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one particular region it must i thought as i viewed it be the outcome of a fire but why had nothing new ever grown over those five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields it lay largely to the north of the ancient road line but encroached a little on the other side i felt an odd reluctance about approaching and did so at last only because my business took me through and past it there was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse but only a fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about the trees near it were sickly and stunted and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim as i walked hurriedly by i saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney and cellar on my right and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight even the long dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast and i marvelled no more at the frightened whispers of arkham people there had been no house or ruin near even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote and at twilight dreading to repass that ominous spot i walked circuitously back to the town by the curving road on the south i vaguely wished some clouds would gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soulin the evening i asked old people in arkham about the blasted heath and what was meant by that phrase strange days which so many evasively muttered i could not however get any good answers except that all the mystery was much more recent than i had dreamed it was not a matter of old legendry at all but something within the lifetime of those who spoke it had happened in the eighties and a family had disappeared or was killed speakers would not be exact and because they all told me to pay no attention to old ammi pierces crazy tales i sought him out the next morning having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick it was a fearsomely archaic place and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long only with persistent knocking could i rouse the aged man and when he shuffled timidly to the door i could tell he was not glad to see me he was not so feeble as i had expected but his eyes drooped in a curious way and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales i feigned a matter of business told him of my surveying and asked vague questions about the district he was far brighter and more educated than i had been led to think and before i knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man i had talked with in arkham he was not like other rustics i had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be from him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake relief was all that he shewed relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life they were better under water nowbetter under water since the strange days and with this opening his husky voice sank low while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressivelyit was then that i heard the story and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on i shivered again and again despite the summer day often i had to recall the speaker from ramblings piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors talk or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity broke down when he was done i did not wonder that his mind had snapped a trifle or that the folk of arkham would not speak much of the blasted heath i hurried back before sunset to my hotel unwilling to have the stars come out above me in the open and the next day returned to boston to give up my position i could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones the reservoir will soon be built now and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms but even then i do not believe i would like to visit that country by nightat least not when the sinister stars are out and nothing could bribe me to drink the new city water of arkhamit all began old ammi said with the meteorite before that time there had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials and even then these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in the miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious stone altar older than the indians these were not haunted woods and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days then there had come that white noontide cloud that string of explosions in the air and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood and by night all arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the nahum gardner place that was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to comethe trim white nahum gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchardsnahum had come to town to tell people about the stone and had dropped in at ammi pierces on the way ammi was forty then and all the queer things were fixed very strongly in his mind he and his wife had gone with the three professors from miskatonic university who hastened out the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space and had wondered why nahum had called it so large the day before it had shrunk nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic wellsweep in his front yard but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink its heat lingered persistently and nahum declared it had glowed faintly in the night the professors tried it with a geologists hammer and found it was oddly soft it was in truth so soft as to be almost plastic and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing they took it in an old pail borrowed from nahums kitchen for even the small piece refused to grow cool on the trip back they stopped at ammis to rest and seemed thoughtful when mrs pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the bottom of the pail truly it was not large but perhaps they had taken less than they thoughtthe day after thatall this was in june of 82the professors had trooped out again in a great excitement as they passed ammis they told him what queer things the specimen had done and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker the beaker had gone too and the wise men talked of the strange stones affinity for silicon it had acted quite unbelievably in that wellordered laboratory doing nothing at all and shewing no occluded gases when heated on charcoal being wholly negative in the borax bead and soon proving itself absolutely nonvolatile at any producible temperature including that of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe on an anvil it appeared highly malleable and in the dark its luminosity was very marked stubbornly refusing to grow cool it soon had the college in a state of real excitement and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements bizarre optical properties and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by the unknownhot as it was they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents water did nothing hydrochloric acid was the same nitric acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things but recognised some solvents as i mentioned them in the usual order of use there were ammonia and caustic soda alcohol and ether nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others but although the weight grew steadily less as time passed and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling there was no change in the solvents to shew that they had attacked the substance at all it was a metal though beyond a doubt it was magnetic for one thing and after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the widmannsttten figures found on meteoric iron when the cooling had grown very considerable the testing was carried on in glass and it was in a glass beaker that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work the next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace and only a charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had beenall this the professors told ammi as they paused at his door and once more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars though this time his wife did not accompany him it had now most certainly shrunk and even the sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw all around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space except where the earth had caved in and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before it was now scarcely five it was still hot and the sages studied its surface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel they gouged deeply this time and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite homogeneousthey had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule imbedded in the substance the colour which resembled some of the bands in the meteors strange spectrum was almost impossible to describe and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all its texture was glossy and upon tapping it appeared to promise both brittleness and hollowness one of the professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer and it burst with a nervous little pop nothing was emitted and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing it left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across and all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing substance wasted awayconjecture was vain so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling the seekers left again with their new specimenwhich proved however as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor had been aside from being almost plastic having heat magnetism and slight luminosity cooling slightly in powerful acids possessing an unknown spectrum wasting away in air and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result it presented no identifying features whatsoever and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it it was nothing of this earth but a piece of the great outside and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside lawsthat night there was a thunderstorm and when the professors went out to nahums the next day they met with a bitter disappointment the stone magnetic as it had been must have had some peculiar electrical property for it had drawn the lightning as nahum said with a singular persistence six times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient wellsweep halfchoked with cavedin earth digging had borne no fruit and the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment the failure was total so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead that fragment lasted a week at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it when it had gone no residue was left behind and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside that lone weird message from other universes and other realms of matter force and entityas was natural the arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate sponsoring and sent reporters to talk with nahum gardner and his family at least one boston daily also sent a scribe and nahum quickly became a kind of local celebrity he was a lean genial person of about fifty living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley he and ammi exchanged visits frequently as did their wives and ammi had nothing but praise for him after all these years he seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had attracted and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks that july and august were hot and nahum worked hard at his haying in the tenacre pasture across chapmans brook his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between the labour tired him more than it had in other years and he felt that age was beginning to tell on himthen fell the time of fruit and harvest the pears and apples slowly ripened and nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before the fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop but with the ripening came sore disappointment for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness so that even the smallest of bites induced a lasting disgust it was the same with the melons and tomatoes and nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost quick to connect events he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot along the roadwinter came early and was very cold ammi saw nahum less often than usual and observed that he had begun to look worried the rest of his family too seemed to have grown taciturn and were far from steady in their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside for this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet nahum himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain footprints in the snow they were the usual winter prints of red squirrels white rabbits and foxes but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement he was never specific but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past nahums house in his sleigh on the way back from clarks corners there had been a moon and a rabbit had run across the road and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either ammi or his horse liked the latter indeed had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein thereafter ammi gave nahums tales more respect and wondered why the gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every morning they had it developed nearly lost the spirit to barkin february the mcgregor boys from meadow hill were out shooting woodchucks and not far from the gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen the proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before the boys were genuinely frightened and threw the thing away at once so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside but the shying of the horses near nahums house had now become an acknowledged thing and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was fast taking formpeople vowed that the snow melted faster around nahums than it did anywhere else and early in march there was an awed discussion in potters general store at clarks corners stephen rice had driven past gardners in the morning and had noticed the skunkcabbages coming up through the mud by the woods across the road never were things of such size seen before and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words their shapes were monstrous and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck stephen as wholly unprecedented that afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world the bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned and it went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in nahums ground of course it was the meteorite and remembering how strange the men from the college had found that stone to be several farmers spoke about the matter to themone day they paid nahum a visit but having no love of wild tales and folklore were very conservative in what they inferred the plants were certainly odd but all skunkcabbages are more or less odd in shape and odour and hue perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the soil but it would soon be washed away and as for the footprints and frightened horsesof course this was mere country talk which such a phenomenon as the arolite would be certain to start there was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip for superstitious rustics will say and believe anything and so all through the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt only one of them when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a year and a half later recalled that the queer colour of that skunkcabbage had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light shewn by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope and like the brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss the samples in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first though later they lost the propertythe trees budded prematurely around nahums and at night they swayed ominously in the wind nahums second son thaddeus a lad of fifteen swore that they swayed also when there was no wind but even the gossips would not credit this certainly however restlessness was in the air the entire gardner family developed the habit of stealthy listening though not for any sound which they could consciously name the listening was indeed rather a product of moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away unfortunately such moments increased week by week till it became common speech that something was wrong with all nahums folks when the early saxifrage came out it had another strange colour not quite like that of the skunkcabbage but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it nahum took some blossoms to arkham and shewed them to the editor of thegazettebut that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule it was a mistake of nahums to tell a stolid city man about the way the great overgrown mourningcloak butterflies behaved in connexion with these saxifragesapril brought a kind of madness to the country folk and began that disuse of the road past nahums which led to its ultimate abandonment it was the vegetation all the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region no sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth the dutchmans breeches became a thing of sinister menace and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion ammi and the gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor nahum ploughed and sowed the tenacre pasture and the upland lot but did nothing with the land around the house he knew it would be of no use and hoped that the summers strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil he was prepared for almost anything now and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard the shunning of his house by neighbours told on him of course but it told on his wife more the boys were better off being at school each day but they could not help being frightened by the gossip thaddeus an especially sensitive youth suffered the mostin may the insects came and nahums place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience the gardners took to watching at nightwatching in all directions at random for something they could not tell what it was then that they all owned that thaddeus had been right about the trees mrs gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky the boughs surely moved and there was no wind it must be the sap strangeness had come into everything growing now yet it was none of nahums family at all who made the next discovery familiarity had dulled them and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends what he told in arkham was given a short paragraph in thegazetteand it was there that all the farmers nahum included saw it first the night had been dark and the buggylamps faint but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be nahums the darkness had been less thick a dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation grass leaves and blossoms alike while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barnthe grass had so far seemed untouched and the cows were freely pastured in the lot near the house but toward the end of may the milk began to be bad then nahum had the cows driven to the uplands after which the trouble ceased not long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye all the verdure was going grey and was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place and his visits were becoming fewer and fewer when school closed the gardners were virtually cut off from the world and sometimes let ammi do their errands in town they were failing curiously both physically and mentally and no one was surprised when the news of mrs gardners madness stole aroundit happened in june about the anniversary of the meteors fall and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe in her raving there was not a single specific noun but only verbs and pronouns things moved and changed and fluttered and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds something was taken awayshe was being drained of somethingsomething was fastening itself on her that ought not to besomeone must make it keep offnothing was ever still in the nightthe walls and windows shifted nahum did not send her to the county asylum but let her wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and others even when her expression changed he did nothing but when the boys grew afraid of her and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him he decided to keep her locked in the attic by july she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours and before that month was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the dark as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetationit was a little before this that the horses had stampeded something had aroused them in the night and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible there seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them and when nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer it took a week to track all four and when found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable something had snapped in their brains and each one had to be shot for its own good nahum borrowed a horse from ammi for his haying but found it would not approach the barn it shied balked and whinnied and in the end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching and all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were greying now and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless the asters and goldenrod bloomed grey and distorted and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such blasphemouslooking things that nahums oldest boy zenas cut them down the strangely puffed insects died about that time even the bees that had left their hives and taken to the woodsby september all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder and nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil his wife now had spells of terrific screaming and he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension they shunned people now and when school opened the boys did not go but it was ammi on one of his rare visits who first realised that the well water was no longer good it had an evil taste that was not exactly foetid nor exactly salty and ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again nahum however ignored the warning for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant things he and the boys continued to use the tainted supply drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and illcooked meals and did their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days there was something of stolid resignation about them all as if they walked half in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doomthaddeus went mad in september after a visit to the well he had gone with a pail and had come back emptyhanded shrieking and waving his arms and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about the moving colours down there two in one family was pretty bad but nahum was very brave about it he let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and hurting himself and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his mothers the way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible especially to little merwin who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was not of earth merwin was getting frightfully imaginative and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the brother who had been his greatest playmatealmost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced poultry turned greyish and died very quickly their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting hogs grew inordinately fat then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain their meat was of course useless and nahum was at his wits end no rural veterinary would approach his place and the city veterinary from arkham was openly baffled the swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died and their eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations it was very inexplicable for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation then something struck the cows certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common in the last stagesand death was always the resultthere would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs there could be no question of poison for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn no bites of prowling things could have brought the virus for what live beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles it must be only natural diseaseyet what disease could wreak such results was beyond any minds guessing when the harvest came there was not an animal surviving on the place for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away these dogs three in number had all vanished one night and were never heard of again the five cats had left some time before but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no mice and only mrs gardner had made pets of the graceful felineson the nineteenth of october nahum staggered into ammis house with hideous news the death had come to poor thaddeus in his attic room and it had come in a way which could not be told nahum had dug a grave in the railed family plot behind the farm and had put therein what he found there could have been nothing from outside for the small barred window and locked door were intact but it was much as it had been in the barn ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they could but shuddered as they did so stark terror seemed to cling round the gardners and all they touched and the very presence of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable ammi accompanied nahum home with the greatest reluctance and did what he might to calm the hysterical sobbing of little merwin zenas needed no calming he had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him and ammi thought that his fate was very merciful now and then merwins screams were answered faintly from the attic and in response to an inquiring look nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble when night approached ammi managed to get away for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind it was really lucky for ammi that he was not more imaginative even as things were his mind was bent ever so slightly but had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac in the twilight he hastened home the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his earsthree days later nahum lurched into ammis kitchen in the early morning and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more while mrs pierce listened in a clutching fright it was little merwin this time he was gone he had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water and had never come back hed been going to pieces for days and hardly knew what he was about screamed at everything there had been a frantic shriek from the yard then but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone there was no glow from the lantern he had taken and of the child himself no trace at the time nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too but when dawn came and the man had plodded back from his allnight search of the woods and fields he had found some very curious things near the well there was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern while a bent bail and twisted iron hoops beside it both halffused seemed to hint at the remnants of the pail that was all nahum was past imagining mrs pierce was blank and ammi when he had reached home and heard the tale could give no guess merwin was gone and there would be no use in telling the people around who shunned all gardners now no use either in telling the city people at arkham who laughed at everything thad was gone and now merwin was gone something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard nahum would go soon and he wanted ammi to look after his wife and zenas if they survived him it must all be a judgment of some sort though he could not fancy what for since he had always walked uprightly in the lords ways so far as he knewfor over two weeks ammi saw nothing of nahum and then worried about what might have happened he overcame his fears and paid the gardner place a visit there was no smoke from the great chimney and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst the aspect of the whole farm was shockinggreyish withered grass and leaves on the ground vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables and great bare trees clawing up at the grey november sky with a studied malevolence which ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches but nahum was alive after all he was weak and lying on a couch in the lowceiled kitchen but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to zenas the room was deadly cold and as ammi visibly shivered the host shouted huskily to zenas for more wood wood indeed was sorely needed since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney presently nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable and then ammi saw what had happened the stoutest cord had broken at last and the hapless farmers mind was proof against more sorrowquestioning tactfully ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing zenas in the wellhe lives in the well was all that the clouded father would say then there flashed across the visitors mind a sudden thought of the mad wife and he changed his line of inquiry nabby why here she is was the surprised response of poor nahum and ammi soon saw that he must search for himself leaving the harmless babbler on the couch he took the keys from their nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic it was very close and noisome up there and no sound could be heard from any direction of the four doors in sight only one was locked and on this he tried various keys on the ring he had taken the third key proved the right one and after some fumbling ammi threw open the low white doorit was quite dark inside for the window was small and halfobscured by the crude wooden bars and ammi could see nothing at all on the wideplanked floor the stench was beyond enduring and before proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air when he did enter he saw something dark in the corner and upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright while he screamed he thought a momentary cloud eclipsed the window and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some hateful current of vapour strange colours danced before his eyes and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor that the geologists hammer had shattered and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring as it was he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young thaddeus and the livestock but the terrible thing about this horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumbleammi would give me no added particulars to this scene but the shape in the corner does not reappear in his tale as a moving object there are things which cannot be mentioned and what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law i gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic room and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment anyone but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad but ammi walked conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him there would be nahum to deal with now he must be fed and tended and removed to some place where he could be cared forcommencing his descent of the dark stairs ammi heard a thud below him he even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off and recalled nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above what presence had his cry and entry started up halted by some vague fear he heard still further sounds below indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction with an associative sense goaded to feverish heights he thought unaccountably of what he had seen upstairs good god what eldritch dreamworld was this into which he had blundered he dared move neither backward nor forward but stood there trembling at the black curve of the boxedin staircase every trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain the sounds the sense of dread expectancy the darkness the steepness of the narrow stepsand merciful heaven the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight steps sides exposed laths and beams alikethen there burst forth a frantic whinny from ammis horse outside followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway in another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them but that was not all there had been another sound out there a sort of liquid splashwaterit must have been the well he had left hero untied near it and a buggywheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a stone and still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably ancient woodwork god how old the house was most of it built before 1670 and the gambrel roof not later than 1730a feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly and ammis grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose slowly nerving himself he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the kitchen but he did not complete the walk because what he sought was no longer there it had come to meet him and it was still alive after a fashion whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external force ammi could not say but the death had been at it everything had happened in the last halfhour but collapse greying and disintegration were already far advanced there was a horrible brittleness and dry fragments were scaling off ammi could not touch it but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that had been a face what was it nahumwhat was it he whispered and the cleft bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answernothin nothin the colour it burns cold an wet but it burns it lived in the well i seen it a kind o smoke jest like the flowers last spring the well shone at night thad an mernie an zenas everything alive suckin the life out of everything in that stone it must a come in that stone pizened the whole place dunt know what it wants that round thing them men from the college dug outen the stone they smashed it it was that same colour jest the same like the flowers an plants must a ben more of em seeds seeds they growed i seen it the fust time this week must a got strong on zenas he was a big boy full o life it beats down your mind an then gits ye burns ye up in the well water you was right about that evil water zenas never come back from the well cant git away draws ye ye know summats comin but taint no use i seen it time an agin senct zenas was took whars nabby ammi my heads no good dunt know how long senct i fed her itll git her ef we aint keerful jest a colour her face is gettin to hev that colour sometimes towards night an it burns an sucks it come from some place whar things aint as they is here one o them professors said so he was right look out ammi itll do suthin more sucks the life out but that was all that which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and reeled out the back door into the fields he climbed the slope to the tenacre pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods he could not pass that well from which his horse had run away he had looked at it through the window and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim then the lurching buggy had not dislodged anything after allthe splash had been something elsesomething which went into the well after it had done with poor nahum when ammi reached his house the horse and buggy had arrived before him and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety reassuring her without explanations he set out at once for arkham and notified the authorities that the gardner family was no more he indulged in no details but merely told of the deaths of nahum and nabby that of thaddeus being already known and mentioned that the cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the livestock he also stated that merwin and zenas had disappeared there was considerable questioning at the police station and in the end ammi was compelled to take three officers to the gardner farm together with the coroner the medical examiner and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals he went much against his will for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place but it was some comfort to have so many people with himthe six men drove out in a democratwagon following ammis buggy and arrived at the pestridden farmhouse about four oclock used as the officers were to gruesome experiences not one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below the whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough but those two crumbling objects were beyond all bounds no one could look long at them and even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine specimens could be analysed of course so he busied himself in obtaining themand here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken under the spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum in which many of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in the previous year the property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonatesammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant to do anything then and there it was getting toward sunset and he was anxious to be away but he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the great sweep and when a detective questioned him he admitted that nahum had feared something down thereso much so that he had never even thought of searching it for merwin or zenas after that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well immediately so ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside the men sniffed in disgust at the fluid and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were uncovering it was not so long a job as they had feared it would be since the water was phenomenally low there is no need to speak too exactly of what they found merwin and zenas were both there in part though the vestiges were mainly skeletal there were also a small deer and a large dog in about the same state and a number of bones of smaller animals the ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling and a man who descended on handholds with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstructiontwilight had now fallen and lanterns were brought from the house then when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sittingroom while the intermittent light of a spectral halfmoon played wanly on the grey desolation outside the men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case and could find no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions the unknown disease of livestock and humans and the unaccountable deaths of merwin and zenas in the tainted well they had heard the common country talk it is true but could not believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred no doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter was it the well water very possibly it might be a good idea to analyse it but what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well their deeds were so similarand the fragments shewed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death why was everything so grey and brittleit was the coroner seated near a window overlooking the yard who first noticed the glow about the well night had fully set in and all the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams but this new glow was something definite and distinct and appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where the water had been emptied it had a very queer colour and as all the men clustered round the window ammi gave a violent start for this strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue he had seen that colour before and feared to think what it might mean he had seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that arolite two summers ago had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime and had thought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had happened it had flashed there a second and a clammy and hateful current of vapour had brushed past himand then poor nahum had been taken by something of that colour he had said so at the lastsaid it was the globule and the plants after that had come the runaway in the yard and the splash in the welland now that well was belching forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same daemoniac tintit does credit to the alertness of ammis mind that he puzzled even at that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific he could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime against a window opening on the morning sky and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape it wasnt rightit was against natureand he thought of those terrible last words of his stricken friend it come from some place whar things aint as they is here one o them professors said so all three horses outside tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road were now neighing and pawing frantically the wagon driver started for the door to do something but ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder dunt go out thar he whispered theys more to this nor what we know nahum said somethin lived in the well that sucks your life out he said it must be someat growed from a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago june sucks an burns he said an is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now that ye can hardly see an cant tell what it is nahum thought it feeds on everything livin an gits stronger all the time he said he seen it this last week it must be somethin from away off in the sky like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was the way its made an the way it works aint like no way o gods world its someat from beyondso the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy it was truly an awful moment with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself four monstrous sets of fragmentstwo from the house and two from the wellin the woodshed behind and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front ammi had restrained the driver on impulse forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did no one will ever know what was abroad that night and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind there is no telling what it might not have done at that last moment and with its seemingly increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the halfclouded moonlit skyall at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short sharp gasp the others looked at him and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested there was no need for words what had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on that the strange days are never talked about in arkham it is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening one did arise not long afterward but there was absolutely none then even the dry tips of the lingering hedgemustard grey and blighted and the fringe on the roof of the standing democratwagon were unstirred and yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving they were twitching morbidly and spasmodically clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black rootsnot a man breathed for several seconds then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily at this there was a general cry muffled with awe but husky and almost identical from every throat for the terror had not faded with the silhouette and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance tipping each bough like the fire of st elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles heads at pentecost it was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light like a glutted swarm of corpsefed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which ammi had come to recognise and dread all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form it was no longershiningout it waspouringout and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the skythe veterinary shivered and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it ammi shook no less and had to tug and point for lack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees the neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward with the moments the shining of the trees increased while their restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality the wood of the wellsweep was shining now and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds and beehives near the stone wall on the west they were commencing to shine too though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road and as ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realised that the span of frantic greys had broke their sapling and run off with the democratwagonthe shock served to loosen several tongues and embarrassed whispers were exchanged it spreads on everything organic thats been around here muttered the medical examiner no one replied but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible it was awful he added there was no bottom at all just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there ammis horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the road outside and nearly drowned its owners faint quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections it come from that stone it growed down thar it got everything livin it fed itself on em mind and body thad an mernie zenas an nabby nahum was the last they all drunk the water it got strong on em it come from beyond whar things aint like they be here now its goin home at this point as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator later described differently there came from poor tethered hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a horse every person in that lowpitched sitting room stopped his ears and ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea words could not convey itwhen ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy that was the last of hero till they buried him next day but the present was no time to mourn for almost at this instant a detective silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them in the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment it glowed on the broadplanked floor and the fragment of rag carpet and shimmered over the sashes of the smallpaned windows it ran up and down the exposed cornerposts coruscated about the shelf and mantel and infected the very doors and furniture each minute saw it strengthen and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that houseammi shewed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the tenacre pasture they walked and stumbled as in a dream and did not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground they were glad of the path for they could not have gone the front way by that well it was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled fiendish contours but thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up the moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge over chapmans brook and it was blind groping from there to the open meadowswhen they looked back toward the valley and the distant gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight all the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour trees buildings and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness the boughs were all straining skyward tipped with tongues of foul flame and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house barn and sheds it was a scene from a vision of fuseli and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the wellseething feeling lapping reaching scintillating straining and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticismthen without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out no watcher can ever forget that sight and ammi stared blankly at the stars of cygnus deneb twinkling above the others where the unknown colour had melted into the milky way but his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley it was just that only a wooden ripping and crackling and not an explosion as so many others of the party vowed yet the outcome was the same for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance blurring the glance of the few who saw it and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown through quickly reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished and in another second they had vanished too behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black frore gusts from interstellar space it shrieked and howled and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy till soon the trembling party realised it would be no use waiting for the moon to shew what was left down there at nahumstoo awed even to hint theories the seven shaking men trudged back toward arkham by the north road ammi was worse than his fellows and begged them to see him inside his own kitchen instead of keeping straight on to town he did not wish to cross the nighted windwhipped woods alone to his home on the main road for he had had an added shock that the others were spared and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come as the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set their faces toward the road ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his illstarred friend and from that stricken faraway spot he had seen something feebly rise only to sink down again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the sky it was just a colourbut not any colour of our earth or heavens and because ammi recognised that colour and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down there in the well he has never been quite right sinceammi would never go near the place again it is over half a century now since the horror happened but he has never been there and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out i shall be glad too for i do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well i passed i hope the water will always be very deepbut even so i shall never drink it i do not think i shall visit the arkham country hereafter three of the men who had been with ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight but there were not any real ruins only the bricks of the chimney the stones of the cellar some mineral and metallic litter here and there and the rim of that nefandous well save for ammis dead horse which they towed away and buried and the buggy which they shortly returned to him everything that had ever been living had gone five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained nor has anything ever grown there since to this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it the blasted heaththe rural tales are queer they might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyse the water from that disused well or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to disperse botanists too ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreadinglittle by little perhaps an inch a year people say the colour of the neighbouring herbage is not quite right in the spring and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere horsesthe few that are left in this motor agegrow skittish in the silent valley and hunters cannot depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dustthey say the mental influences are very bad too numbers went queer in the years after nahums taking and always they lacked the power to get away then the strongerminded folk all left the region and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads they could not stay though and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild weird stores of whispered magic have given them their dreams at night they protest are very horrible in that grotesque country and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy no traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye i myself am curious about the sensation i derived from my one lone walk before ammi told me his tale when twilight came i had vaguely wished some clouds would gather for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my souldo not ask me for my opinion i do not knowthat is all there was no one but ammi to question for arkham people will not talk about the strange days and all three professors who saw the arolite and its coloured globule are dead there were other globulesdepend upon that one must have fed itself and escaped and probably there was another which was too late no doubt it is still down the welli know there was something wrong with the sunlight i saw above that miasmal brink the rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now but whatever daemon hatchling is there it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air one of the current arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at nightwhat it is only god knows in terms of matter i suppose the thing ammi described would be called a gas but this gas obeyed laws that are not of our cosmos this was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories this was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure it was just a colour out of spacea frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all nature as we know it from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extracosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyesi doubt very much if ammi consciously lied to me and i do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor and something terriblethough i know not in what proportionstill remains i shall be glad to see the water come meanwhile i hope nothing will happen to ammi he saw so much of the thingand its influence was so insidious why has he never been able to move away how clearly he recalled those dying words of nahumscant git away draws ye ye know summats comin but taint no use ammi is such a good old manwhen the reservoir gang gets to work i must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him i would hate to think of him as the grey twisted brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep,1
you ask me to explain why i am afraid of a draught of cool air why i shiver more than others upon entering a cold room and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day there are those who say i respond to cold as others do to a bad odour and i am the last to deny the impression what i will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance i ever encountered and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarityit is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness silence and solitude i found it in the glare of midafternoon in the clangour of a metropolis and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace roominghouse with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side in the spring of 1923 i had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of new york and being unable to pay any substantial rent began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness endurable furnishings and very reasonable price it soon developed that i had only a choice between different evils but after a time i came upon a house in west fourteenth street which disgusted me much less than the others i had sampledthe place was a fourstory mansion of brownstone dating apparently from the late forties and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence in the rooms large and lofty and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery but the floors were clean the linen tolerably regular and the hot water not too often cold or turned off so that i came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again the landlady a slatternly almost bearded spanish woman named herrero did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the lateburning electric light in my thirdfloor front hall room and my fellowlodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire being mostly spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyancei had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred one evening at about eight i heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that i had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time looking about i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street anxious to stop the matter at its source i hastened to the basement to tell the landlady and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set rightdoctair muoz she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me he have speel hees chemicals he ees too seeck for doctair heemselfseecker and seecker all the timebut he weel not have no othair for help he ees vairy queer in hees seecknessall day he take funneesmelling baths and he cannot get excite or warm all hees own housework he dohees leetle room are full of bottles and machines and he do not work as doctair but he was great oncemy fathair in barcelona have hear of heemand only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get hurt of sudden he nevair go out only on roof and my boy esteban he breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals my gawd the salammoniac that man use for keep heem coolmrs herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor and i returned to my room the ammonia ceased to drip and as i cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air i heard the landladys heavy footsteps above me dr muoz i had never heard save for certain sounds as of some gasolinedriven mechanism since his step was soft and gentle i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity there is i reflected tritely an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come down in the worldi might never have known dr muoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room physicians had told me of the danger of those spells and i knew there was no time to be lost so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalids help of the injured workman i dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine my knock was answered in good english by a curious voice some distance to the right asking my name and business and these things being stated there came an opening of the door next to the one i had soughta rush of cool air greeted me and though the day was one of the hottest of late june i shivered as i crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness a folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa and the mahogany furniture sumptuous hangings old paintings and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentlemans study rather than a boardinghouse bedroom i now saw that the hall room above minethe leetle room of bottles and machines which mrs herrero had mentionedwas merely the laboratory of the doctor and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices dr muoz most certainly was a man of birth cultivation and discriminationthe figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit a highbred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short irongrey full beard and an oldfashioned pincenez shielded the full dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly celtiberian thick welltrimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breedingnevertheless as i saw dr muoz in that blast of cool air i felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling and even these things should have been excusable considering the mans known invalidism it might too have been the singular cold that alienated me for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day and the abnormal always excites aversion distrust and fearbut repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration for the strange physicians extreme skill at once became manifest despite the icecoldness and shakiness of his bloodlesslooking hands he clearly understood my needs at a glance and ministered to them with a masters deftness the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room evidently he found the society of a wellborn man a rare novelty in this dingy environment and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over himhis voice if queer was at least soothing and i could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out he sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his theories and experiments and i remember his tactfully consoling me about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself so that if a bodily frame be but originally healthy and carefully preserved it may through a scientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the most serious impairments defects or even absences in the battery of specific organs he might he half jestingly said some day teach me to liveor at least to possess some kind of conscious existencewithout any heart at all for his part he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold any marked rise in temperature might if prolonged affect him fatally and the frigidity of his habitationsome 55 or 56 degrees fahrenheitwas maintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling the gasoline engine of whose pumps i had often heard in my own room belowrelieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse after that i paid him frequent overcoated calls listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly results and trembling a bit when i examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves i was eventually i may add almost cured of my disease for all time by his skilful ministrations it seems that he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists since he believed these cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled i was touched by his account of the aged dr torres of valencia who had shared his earlier experiments with him through the great illness of eighteen years before whence his present disorders proceeded no sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought perhaps the strain had been too great for dr muoz made it whisperingly clearthough not in detailthat the methods of healing had been most extraordinary involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative galensas the weeks passed i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically as mrs herrero had suggested the livid aspect of his countenance was intensified his voice became more hollow and indistinct his muscular motions were less perfectly cordinated and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion i had originally felthe developed strange caprices acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a sepulchred pharaoh in the valley of kings at the same time his demands for cold air increased and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34 or 40 and finally even 28 the bathroom and laboratory of course being less chilled in order that water might not freeze and that chemical processes might not be impeded the tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the connecting door so i helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty a kind of growing horror of outr and morbid cast seemed to possess him he talked of death incessantly but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggestedall in all he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose i likewise did much of his shopping and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply housesan increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment the whole house as i have said had a musty odour but the smell in his room was worseand in spite of all the spices and incense and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided i perceived that it must be connected with his ailment and shuddered when i reflected on what that ailment might be mrs herrero crossed herself when she looked at him and gave him up unreservedly to me not even letting her son esteban continue to run errands for him when i suggested other physicians the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain he evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned and he refused to be confined to his bed the lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the deathdaemon even as that ancient enemy seized him the pretence of eating always curiously like a formality with him he virtually abandoned and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total collapsehe acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that i transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he namedfor the most part lettered east indians but including a once celebrated french physician now generally thought dead and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered as it happened i burned all these papers undelivered and unopened his aspect and voice became utterly frightful and his presence almost unbearable one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight that man oddly enough had been through the terrors of the great war without having incurred any fright so thoroughthen in the middle of october the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness one night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible dr muoz summoned me by thumping on the floor and i worked desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless rattling hollowness surpassed description my amateur efforts however proved of no use and when i had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring allnight garage we learned that nothing could be done till morning when a new piston would have to be obtained the moribund hermits rage and fear swelling to grotesque proportions seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom he groped his way out with face tightly bandaged and i never saw his eyes againthe frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing and at about 5 am the doctor retired to the bathroom commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice i could obtain at allnight drug stores and cafeterias as i would return from my sometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door i could hear a restless splashing within and a thick voice croaking out the order for moremore at length a warm day broke and the shops opened one by one i asked esteban either to help with the icefetching whilst i obtained the pump piston or to order the piston while i continued with the ice but instructed by his mother he absolutely refusedfinally i hired a seedylooking loafer whom i encountered on the corner of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where i introduced him and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it the task seemed interminable and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless foodless round of vain telephoning and a hectic quest from place to place hither and thither by subway and surface car about noon i encountered a suitable supply house far downtown and at approximately 130 pm arrived at my boardingplace with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics i had done all i could and hoped i was in timeblack terror however had preceded me the house was in utter turmoil and above the chatter of awed voices i heard a man praying in a deep basso fiendish things were in the air and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctors closed door the lounger i had hired it seems had fled screaming and madeyed not long after his second delivery of ice perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity he could not of course have locked the door behind him yet it was now fastened presumably from the inside there was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow thick drippingbriefly consulting with mrs herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul i advised the breaking down of the door but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device we had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall and flung all the windows to the very top now noses protected by handkerchiefs we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoona kind of dark slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door and thence to the desk where a terrible little pool had accumulated something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterablywhat was or had been on the couch i cannot and dare not say here but this is what i shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before i drew a match and burned it to a crisp what i puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station the nauseous words seemed wellnigh incredible in that yellow sunlight with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending clamorously from crowded fourteenth street yet i confess that i believed them then whether i believe them now i honestly do not know there are things about which it is better not to speculate and all that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool airthe end ran that noisome scrawl is here no more icethe man looked and ran away warmer every minute and the tissues cant last i fancy you knowwhat i said about the will and the nerves and the preserved body after the organs ceased to work it was good theory but couldnt keep up indefinitely there was a gradual deterioration i had not foreseen dr torres knew but the shock killed him he couldnt stand what he had to dohe had to get me in a strange dark place when he minded my letter and nursed me back and the organs never would work again it had to be done my wayartificial preservationfor you see i died that time eighteen years ago,1
of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written the ecstasies and horrors of de quincey and theparadis artificielsof baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them immortal and the world knows well the beauty the terror and the mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is transported but much as has been told no man has yet dared intimate thenatureof the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind or hint at thedirectionof the unheardof roads along whose ornate and exotic course the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne de quincey was drawn back into asia that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous antiquity is so impressive that the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual but farther than that he dared not go those whohavegone farther seldom returned and even when they have they have been either silent or quite mad i took opium but oncein the year of the plague when doctors sought to deaden the agonies they could not cure there was an overdosemy physician was worn out with horror and exertionand i travelled very far indeed in the end i returned and lived but my nights are filled with strange memories nor have i ever permitted a doctor to give me opium againthe pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the drug was administered of the future i had no heed to escape whether by cure unconsciousness or death was all that concerned me i was partly delirious so that it is hard to place the exact moment of transition but i think the effect must have begun shortly before the pounding ceased to be painful as i have said there was an overdose so my reactions were probably far from normal the sensation of falling curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction was paramount though there was a subsidiary impression of unseen throngs in incalculable profusion throngs of infinitely diverse nature but all more or less related to me sometimes it seemed less as though i were falling than as though the universe or the ages were falling past me suddenly my pain ceased and i began to associate the pounding with an external rather than internal force the falling had ceased also giving place to a sensation of uneasy temporary rest and when i listened closely i fancied the pounding was that of the vast inscrutable sea as its sinister colossal breakers lacerated some desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude then i opened my eyesfor a moment my surroundings seemed confused like a projected image hopelessly out of focus but gradually i realised my solitary presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows of the exact nature of the apartment i could form no idea for my thoughts were still far from settled but i noticed varicoloured rugs and draperies elaborately fashioned tables chairs ottomans and divans and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the exotic without being actually alien these things i noticed yet they were not long uppermost in my mind slowly but inexorably crawling upon my consciousness and rising above every other impression came a dizzying fear of the unknown a fear all the greater because i could not analyse it and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menacenot death but some nameless unheardof thing inexpressibly more ghastly and abhorrentpresently i realised that the direct symbol and excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain it seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which i stood and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images i felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the silkhung walls and shrank from glancing through the arched latticed windows that opened so bewilderingly on every hand perceiving shutters attached to these windows i closed them all averting my eyes from the exterior as i did so then employing a flint and steel which i found on one of the small tables i lit the many candles reposing about the walls in arabesque sconces the added sense of security brought by closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree but i could not shut out the monotonous pounding now that i was calmer the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful and i felt a contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful shrinking opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the pounding i beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a carven door and large oriel window to this window i was irresistibly drawn though my illdefined apprehensions seemed almost equally bent on holding me back as i approached it i could see a chaotic whirl of waters in the distance then as i attained it and glanced out on all sides the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with full and devastating forcei beheld such a sight as i had never beheld before and which no living person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of opium the building stood on a narrow point of landor what wasnowa narrow point of landfully 300 feet above what must lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters on either side of the house there fell a newly washedout precipice of red earth whilst ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully eating away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation out a mile or more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in height and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures the waves were dark and purplish almost black and clutched at the yielding red mud of the bank as if with uncouth greedy hands i could not but feel that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon all the solid ground perhaps abetted by the angry skyrecovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural spectacle had thrown me i realised that my actual physical danger was acute even whilst i gazed the bank had lost many feet and it could not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit of lashing waves accordingly i hastened to the opposite side of the edifice and finding a door emerged at once locking it after me with a curious key which had hung inside i now beheld more of the strange region about me and marked a singular division which seemed to exist in the hostile ocean and firmament on each side of the jutting promontory different conditions held sway at my left as i faced inland was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in under a brightly shining sun something about that suns nature and position made me shudder but i could not then tell and cannot tell now what it was at my right also was the sea but it was blue calm and only gently undulating while the sky above it was darker and the washedout bank more nearly white than reddishi now turned my attention to the land and found occasion for fresh surprise for the vegetation resembled nothing i had ever seen or read about it was apparently tropical or at least subtropicala conclusion borne out by the intense heat of the air sometimes i thought i could trace strange analogies with the flora of my native land fancying that the wellknown plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical change of climate but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were plainly foreign the house i had just left was very smallhardly more than a cottagebut its material was evidently marble and its architecture was weird and composite involving a quaint fusion of western and eastern forms at the corners were corinthian columns but the red tile roof was like that of a chinese pagoda from the door inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand about four feet wide and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable flowering shrubs and plants it lay toward the side of the promontory where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish down this path i felt impelled to flee as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the pounding ocean at first it was slightly uphill then i reached a gentle crest behind me i saw the scene i had left the entire point with the cottage and the black water with the green sea on one side and the blue sea on the other and a curse unnamed and unnamable lowering over all i never saw it again and often wonder after this last look i strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before methe path as i have intimated ran along the righthand shore as one went inland ahead and to the left i now viewed a magnificent valley comprising thousands of acres and covered with a swaying growth of tropical grass higher than my head almost at the limit of vision was a colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me by this time wonder and escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely dissipated my fear but as i paused and sank fatigued to the path idly digging with my hands into the warm whitishgolden sand a new and acute sense of danger seized me some terror in the swishing tall grass seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea and i started up crying aloud and disjointedly tiger tiger is it tiger beast beast is it a beast that i am afraid of my mind wandered back to an ancient and classical story of tigers which i had read i strove to recall the author but had difficulty then in the midst of my fear i remembered that the tale was by rudyard kipling nor did the grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me i wished for the volume containing this story and had almost started back toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the lure of the palm prevented mewhether or not i could have resisted the backward beckoning without the counterfascination of the vast palm tree i do not know this attraction was now dominant and i left the path and crawled on hands and knees down the valleys slope despite my fear of the grass and of the serpents it might contain i resolved to fight for life and reason as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land though i sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant breakers i would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for relief but could never quite shut out the detestable sound it was as it seemed to me only after ages that i finally dragged myself to the beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shadethere now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror incidents which i tremble to recall and dare not seek to interpret no sooner had i crawled beneath the overhanging foliage of the palm than there dropped from its branches a young child of such beauty as i never beheld before though ragged and dusty this being bore the features of a faun or demigod and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the tree it smiled and extended its hand but before i could arise and speak i heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing notes high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness the sun had by this time sunk below the horizon and in the twilight i saw that an aureola of lambent light encircled the childs head then in a tone of silver it addressed me it is the end they have come down through the gloaming from the stars now all is over and beyond the arinurian streams we shall dwell blissfully in teloe as the child spoke i beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree and rising greeted a pair whom i knew to be the chief singers among those i had heard a god and goddess they must have been for such beauty is not mortal and they took my hands saying come child you have heard the voices and all is well in teloe beyond the milky way and the arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony and upon their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful stars under the ivory bridges of teloe flow rivers of liquid gold bearing pleasurebarges bound for blossomy cytharion of the seven suns and in teloe and cytharion abide only youth beauty and pleasure nor are any sounds heard save of laughter song and the lute only the gods dwell in teloe of the golden rivers but among them shalt thou dwellas i listened enchanted i suddenly became aware of a change in my surroundings the palm tree so lately overshadowing my exhausted form was now some distance to my left and considerably below me i was obviously floating in the atmosphere companioned not only by the strange child and the radiant pair but by a constantly increasing throng of halfluminous vinecrowned youths and maidens with windblown hair and joyful countenance we slowly ascended together as if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from the golden nebulae and the child whispered in my ear that i must look always upward to the pathways of light and never backward to the sphere i had just left the youths and maidens now chaunted mellifluous choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes and i felt enveloped in a peace and happiness more profound than any i had in life imagined when the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my soul through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists as if in mocking daemoniac concord throbbed from gulfs below the damnable the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean and as those black breakers beat their message into my ears i forgot the words of the child and looked back down upon the doomed scene from which i thought i had escapeddown through the aether i saw the accursed earth turning ever turning with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted cities and under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights i can never describe sights i can never forget deserts of corpselike clay and jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains and villages of my native land and maelstroms of frothing ocean where once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers around the northern pole steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours hissing before the onslaught of the evermounting waves that curled and fretted from the shuddering deep then a rending report clave the night and athwart the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift still the black ocean foamed and gnawed eating away the desert on either side as the rift in the centre widened and widenedthere was now no land left but the desert and still the fuming ocean ate and ate all at once i thought even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something afraid of dark gods of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters but even if it was it could not turn back and the desert had suffered too much from those nightmare waves to help them now so the ocean ate the last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf thereby giving up all it had ever conquered from the newflooded lands it flowed again uncovering death and decay and from its ancient and immemorial bed it trickled loathsomely uncovering nighted secrets of the years when time was young and the gods unborn above the waves rose weedy remembered spires the moon laid pale lilies of light on dead london and paris stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with stardust then rose spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered terrible spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were landsthere was not any pounding now but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of waters tumbling into the rift the smoke of that rift had changed to steam and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser it seared my face and hands and when i looked to see how it affected my companions i found they had all disappeared then very suddenly it ended and i knew no more till i awaked upon a bed of convalescence as the cloud of steam from the plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire surface from my sight all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether in one delirious flash and burst it happened one blinding deafening holocaust of fire smoke and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to the voidand when the smoke cleared away and i sought to look upon the earth i beheld against the background of cold humorous stars only the dying sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister,1
in 1925 i went into oklahoma looking for snake lore and i came out with a fear of snakes that will last me the rest of my life i admit it is foolish since there are natural explanations for everything i saw and heard but it masters me none the less if the old story had been all there was to it i would not have been so badly shaken my work as an american indian ethnologist has hardened me to all kinds of extravagant legendry and i know that simple white people can beat the redskins at their own game when it comes to fanciful inventions but i cant forget what i saw with my own eyes at the insane asylum in guthriei called at that asylum because a few of the oldest settlers told me i would find something important there neither indians nor white men would discuss the snakegod legends i had come to trace the oilboom newcomers of course knew nothing of such matters and the red men and old pioneers were plainly frightened when i spoke of them not more than six or seven people mentioned the asylum and those who did were careful to talk in whispers but the whisperers said that dr mcneill could shew me a very terrible relic and tell me all i wanted to know he could explain why yig the halfhuman father of serpents is a shunned and feared object in central oklahoma and why old settlers shiver at the secret indian orgies which make the autumn days and nights hideous with the ceaseless beating of tomtoms in lonely placesit was with the scent of a hound on the trail that i went to guthrie for i had spent many years collecting data on the evolution of serpentworship among the indians i had always felt from welldefined undertones of legend and archaeology that great quetzalcoatlbenign snakegod of the mexicanshad had an older and darker prototype and during recent months i had wellnigh proved it in a series of researches stretching from guatemala to the oklahoma plains but everything was tantalising and incomplete for above the border the cult of the snake was hedged about by fear and furtivenessnow it appeared that a new and copious source of data was about to dawn and i sought the head of the asylum with an eagerness i did not try to cloak dr mcneill was a small cleanshaven man of somewhat advanced years and i saw at once from his speech and manner that he was a scholar of no mean attainments in many branches outside his profession grave and doubtful when i first made known my errand his face grew thoughtful as he carefully scanned my credentials and the letter of introduction which a kindly old exindian agent had given meso youve been studying the yig legend eh he reflected sententiously i know that many of our oklahoma ethnologists have tried to connect it with quetzalcoatl but i dont think any of them have traced the intermediate steps so well youve done remarkable work for a man as young as you seem to be and you certainly deserve all the data we can givei dont suppose old major moore or any of the others told you what it is i have here they dont like to talk about it and neither do i it is very tragic and very horrible but that is all i refuse to consider it anything supernatural theres a story about it that ill tell you after you see ita devilish sad story but one that i wont call magic it merely shews the potency that belief has over some people ill admit there are times when i feel a shiver thats more than physical but in daylight i set all that down to nerves im not a young fellow any more alasto come to the point the thing i have is what you might call a victim of yigs cursea physically living victim we dont let the bulk of the nurses see it although most of them know its here there are just two steady old chaps whom i let feed it and clean out its quartersused to be three but good old stevens passed on a few years ago i suppose ill have to break in a new group pretty soon for the thing doesnt seem to age or change much and we old boys cant last forever maybe the ethics of the near future will let us give it a merciful release but its hard to telldid you see that single groundglass basement window over in the east wing when you came up the drive thats where it is ill take you there myself now you neednt make any comment just look through the moveable panel in the door and thank god the light isnt any stronger then ill tell you the storyor as much as ive been able to piece togetherwe walked downstairs very quietly and did not talk as we threaded the corridors of the seemingly deserted basement dr mcneill unlocked a greypainted steel door but it was only a bulkhead leading to a further stretch of hallway at length he paused before a door marked b 116 opened a small observation panel which he could use only by standing on tiptoe and pounded several times upon the painted metal as if to arouse the occupant whatever it might bea faint stench came from the aperture as the doctor unclosed it and i fancied his pounding elicited a kind of low hissing response finally he motioned me to replace him at the peephole and i did so with a causeless and increasing tremor the barred groundglass window close to the earth outside admitted only a feeble and uncertain pallor and i had to look into the malodorous den for several seconds before i could see what was crawling and wriggling about on the strawcovered floor emitting every now and then a weak and vacuous hiss then the shadowed outlines began to take shape and i perceived that the squirming entity bore some remote resemblance to a human form laid flat on its belly i clutched at the doorhandle for support as i tried to keep from faintingthe moving object was almost of human size and entirely devoid of clothing it was absolutely hairless and its tawnylooking back seemed subtly squamous in the dim ghoulish light around the shoulders it was rather speckled and brownish and the head was very curiously flat as it looked up to hiss at me i saw that the beady little black eyes were damnably anthropoid but i could not bear to study them long they fastened themselves on me with a horrible persistence so that i closed the panel gaspingly and left the creature to wriggle about unseen in its matted straw and spectral twilight i must have reeled a bit for i saw that the doctor was gently holding my arm as he guided me away i was stuttering over and over again bbut for gods sakewhat is itdr mcneill told me the story in his private office as i sprawled opposite him in an easychair the gold and crimson of late afternoon changed to the violet of early dusk but still i sat awed and motionless i resented every ring of the telephone and every whir of the buzzer and i could have cursed the nurses and internes whose knocks now and then summoned the doctor briefly to the outer office night came and i was glad my host switched on all the lights scientist though i was my zeal for research was half forgotten amidst such breathless ecstasies of fright as a small boy might feel when whispered witchtales go the rounds of the chimneycornerit seems that yig the snakegod of the central plains tribespresumably the primal source of the more southerly quetzalcoatl or kukulcanwas an odd halfanthropomorphic devil of highly arbitrary and capricious nature he was not wholly evil and was usually quite welldisposed toward those who gave proper respect to him and his children the serpents but in the autumn he became abnormally ravenous and had to be driven away by means of suitable rites that was why the tomtoms in the pawnee wichita and caddo country pounded ceaselessly week in and week out in august september and october and why the medicinemen made strange noises with rattles and whistles curiously like those of the aztecs and mayasyigs chief trait was a relentless devotion to his childrena devotion so great that the redskins almost feared to protect themselves from the venomous rattlesnakes which thronged the region frightful clandestine tales hinted of his vengeance upon mortals who flouted him or wreaked harm upon his wriggling progeny his chosen method being to turn his victim after suitable tortures to a spotted snakein the old days of the indian territory the doctor went on there was not quite so much secrecy about yig the plains tribes less cautious than the desert nomads and pueblos talked quite freely of their legends and autumn ceremonies with the first indian agents and let considerable of the lore spread out through the neighbouring regions of white settlement the great fear came in the landrush days of 89 when some extraordinary incidents had been rumoured and the rumours sustained by what seemed to be hideously tangible proofs indians said that the new white men did not know how to get on with yig and afterward the settlers came to take that theory at face value now no oldtimer in middle oklahoma white or red could be induced to breathe a word about the snakegod except in vague hints yet after all the doctor added with almost needless emphasis the only truly authenticated horror had been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather than of bewitchment it was all very material and crueleven that last phase which had caused so much disputedr mcneill paused and cleared his throat before getting down to his special story and i felt a tingling sensation as when a theatre curtain rises the thing had begun when walker davis and his wife audrey left arkansas to settle in the newly opened public lands in the spring of 1889 and the end had come in the country of the wichitasnorth of the wichita river in what is at present caddo county there is a small village called binger there now and the railway goes through but otherwise the place is less changed than other parts of oklahoma it is still a section of farms and ranchesquite productive in these dayssince the great oilfields do not come very closewalker and audrey had come from franklin county in the ozarks with a canvastopped wagon two mules an ancient and useless dog called wolf and all their household goods they were typical hillfolk youngish and perhaps a little more ambitious than most and looked forward to a life of better returns for their hard work than they had had in arkansas both were lean rawboned specimens the man tall sandy and greyeyed and the woman short and rather dark with a black straightness of hair suggesting a slight indian admixturein general there was very little of distinction about them and but for one thing their annals might not have differed from those of thousands of other pioneers who flocked into the new country at that time that thing was walkers almost epileptic fear of snakes which some laid to prenatal causes and some said came from a dark prophecy about his end with which an old indian squaw had tried to scare him when he was small whatever the cause the effect was marked indeed for despite his strong general courage the very mention of a snake would cause him to grow faint and pale while the sight of even a tiny specimen would produce a shock sometimes bordering on a convulsion seizurethe davises started out early in the year in the hope of being on their new land for the spring ploughing travel was slow for the roads were bad in arkansas while in the territory there were great stretches of rolling hills and red sandy barrens without any roads whatever as the terrain grew flatter the change from their native mountains depressed them more perhaps than they realised but they found the people at the indian agencies very affable while most of the settled indians seemed friendly and civil now and then they encountered a fellowpioneer with whom crude pleasantries and expressions of amiable rivalry were generally exchangedowing to the season there were not many snakes in evidence so walker did not suffer from his special temperamental weakness in the earlier stages of the journey too there were no indian snakelegends to trouble him for the transplanted tribes from the southeast do not share the wilder beliefs of their western neighbours as fate would have it it was a white man at okmulgee in the creek country who gave the davises the first hint of yig beliefs a hint which had a curiously fascinating effect on walker and caused him to ask questions very freely after thatbefore long walkers fascination had developed into a bad case of fright he took the most extraordinary precautions at each of the nightly camps always clearing away whatever vegetation he found and avoiding stony places whenever he could every clump of stunted bushes and every cleft in the great slablike rocks seemed to him now to hide malevolent serpents while every human figure not obviously part of a settlement or emigrant train seemed to him a potential snakegod till nearness had proved the contrary fortunately no troublesome encounters came at this stage to shake his nerves still furtheras they approached the kickapoo country they found it harder and harder to avoid camping near rocks finally it was no longer possible and poor walker was reduced to the puerile expedient of droning some of the rustic antisnake charms he had learned in his boyhood two or three times a snake was really glimpsed and these sights did not help the sufferer in his efforts to preserve composureon the twentysecond evening of the journey a savage wind made it imperative for the sake of the mules to camp in as sheltered a spot as possible and audrey persuaded her husband to take advantage of a cliff which rose uncommonly high above the dried bed of a former tributary of the canadian river he did not like the rocky cast of the place but allowed himself to be overruled this once leading the animals sullenly toward the protecting slope which the nature of the ground would not allow the wagon to approachaudrey examining the rocks near the wagon meanwhile noticed a singular sniffing on the part of the feeble old dog seizing a rifle she followed his lead and presently thanked her stars that she had forestalled walker in her discovery for there snugly nested in the gap between two boulders was a sight it would have done him no good to see visible only as one convoluted expanse but perhaps comprising as many as three or four separate units was a mass of lazy wriggling which could not be other than a brood of newborn rattlesnakesanxious to save walker from a trying shock audrey did not hesitate to act but took the gun firmly by the barrel and brought the butt down again and again upon the writhing objects her own sense of loathing was great but it did not amount to a real fear finally she saw that her task was done and turned to cleanse the improvised bludgeon in the red sand and dry dead grass near by she must she reflected cover the nest up before walker got back from tethering the mules old wolf tottering relic of mixed shepherd and coyote ancestry that he was had vanished and she feared he had gone to fetch his masterfootsteps at that instant proved her fear well founded a second more and walker had seen everything audrey made a move to catch him if he should faint but he did no more than sway then the look of pure fright on his bloodless face turned slowly to something like mingled awe and anger and he began to upbraid his wife in trembling tonesgawds sake aud but whyd ye go for to do that haint ye heerd all the things theyve been tellin about this snakedevil yig yed ought to a told me and wed a moved on dont ye know theys a devilgod what gets even if ye hurts his children what for dye think the injuns all dances and beats their drums in the fall about this lands under a curse i tell yenigh every soul weve atalked to sence we come ins said the same yig rules here an he comes out every fall for to git his victims and turn em into snakes why aud they wont none of them

offen some o the injun medicinemen hell git ye aud as sures theys a gawd in heavenhell come outa the night and turn ye into a crawlin spotted snakeall the rest of the journey walker kept up the frightened reproofs and prophecies they crossed the canadian near newcastle and soon afterward met with the first of the real plains indians they had seena party of blanketed wichitas whose leader talked freely under the spell of the whiskey offered him and taught poor walker a longwinded protective charm against yig in exchange for a quart bottle of the same inspiring fluid by the end of the week the chosen site in the wichita country was reached and the davises made haste to trace their boundaries and perform the spring ploughing before even beginning the construction of a cabinthe region was flat drearily windy and sparse of natural vegetation but promised great fertility under cultivation occasional outcroppings of granite diversified a soil of decomposed red sandstone and here and there a great flat rock would stretch along the surface of the ground like a manmade floor there seemed to be a very few snakes or possible dens for them so audrey at last persuaded walker to build the oneroom cabin over a vast smooth slab of exposed stone with such a flooring and with a goodsized fireplace the wettest weather might be defiedthough it soon became evident that dampness was no salient quality of the district logs were hauled in the wagon from the nearest belt of woods many miles toward the wichita mountainswalker built his widechimneyed cabin and crude barn with the aid of some of the other settlers though the nearest one was over a mile away in turn he helped his helpers at similar houseraisings so that many ties of friendship sprang up between the new neighbours there was no town worthy the name nearer than el reno on the railway thirty miles or more to the northeast and before many weeks had passed the people of the section had become very cohesive despite the wideness of their scattering the indians a few of whom had begun to settle down on ranches were for the most part harmless though somewhat quarrelsome when fired by the liquid stimulation which found its way to them despite all government bansof all the neighbours the davises found joe and sally compton who likewise hailed from arkansas the most helpful and congenial sally is still alive known now as grandma compton and her son clyde then an infant in arms has become one of the leading men of the state sally and audrey used to visit each other often for their cabins were only two miles apart and in the long spring and summer afternoons they exchanged many a tale of old arkansas and many a rumour about the new countrysally was very sympathetic about walkers weakness regarding snakes but perhaps did more to aggravate than cure the parallel nervousness which audrey was acquiring through his incessant praying and prophesying about the curse of yig she was uncommonly full of gruesome snake stories and produced a direfully strong impression with her acknowledged masterpiecethe tale of a man in scott county who had been bitten by a whole horde of rattlers at once and had swelled so monstrously from poison that his body had finally burst with a pop needless to say audrey did not repeat this anecdote to her husband and she implored the comptons to beware of starting it on the rounds of the countryside it is to joes and sallys credit that they heeded this plea with the utmost fidelitywalker did his cornplanting early and in midsummer improved his time by harvesting a fair crop of the native grass of the region with the help of joe compton he dug a well which gave a moderate supply of very good water though he planned to sink an artesian later on he did not run into many serious snake scares and made his land as inhospitable as possible for wriggling visitors every now and then he rode over to the cluster of thatched conical huts which formed the main village of the wichitas and talked long with the old men and shamans about the snakegod and how to nullify his wrath charms were always ready in exchange for whiskey but much of the information he got was far from reassuringyig was a great god he was bad medicine he did not forget things in the autumn his children were hungry and wild and yig was hungry and wild too all the tribes made medicine against yig when the corn harvest came they gave him some corn and danced in proper regalia to the sound of whistle rattle and drum they kept the drums pounding to drive yig away and called down the aid of tirwa whose children men are even as the snakes are yigs children it was bad that the squaw of davis killed the children of yig let davis say the charms many times when the corn harvest comes yig is yig yig is a great godby the time the corn harvest did come walker had succeeded in getting his wife into a deplorably jumpy state his prayers and borrowed incantations came to be a nuisance and when the autumn rites of the indians began there was always a distant windborne pounding of tomtoms to lend an added background of the sinister it was maddening to have the muffled clatter always stealing over the wide red plains why would it never stop day and night week on week it was always going in exhaustless relays as persistently as the red dusty winds that carried it audrey loathed it more than her husband did for he saw in it a compensating element of protection it was with this sense of a mighty intangible bulwark against evil that he got in his corn crop and prepared cabin and stable for the coming winterthe autumn was abnormally warm and except for their primitive cookery the davises found scant use for the stone fireplace walker had built with such care something in the unnaturalness of the hot dustclouds preyed on the nerves of all the settlers but most of all on audreys and walkers the notions of a hovering snakecurse and the weird endless rhythm of the distant indian drums formed a bad combination which any added element of the bizarre went far to render utterly unendurablenotwithstanding this strain several festive gatherings were held at one or another of the cabins after the crops were reaped keeping naively alive in modernity those curious rites of the harvesthome which are as old as human agriculture itself lafayette smith who came from southern missouri and had a cabin about three miles east of walkers was a very passable fiddler and his tunes did much to make the celebrants forget the monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms then halloween drew near and the settlers planned another frolicthis time had they but known it of a lineage older than even agriculture the dread witchsabbath of the primal prearyans kept alive through ages in the midnight blackness of secret woods and still hinting at vague terrors under its latterday mask of comedy and lightness halloween was to fall on a thursday and the neighbours agreed to gather for their first revel at the davis cabinit was on that thirtyfirst of october that the warm spell broke the morning was grey and leaden and by noon the incessant winds had changed from searingness to rawness people shivered all the more because they were not prepared for the chill and walker davis old dog wolf dragged himself wearily indoors to a place beside the hearth but the distant drums still thumped on nor were the white citizenry less inclined to pursue their chosen rites as early as four in the afternoon the wagons began to arrive at walkers cabin and in the evening after a memorable barbecue lafayette smiths fiddle inspired a very fairsized company to great feats of saltatory grotesqueness in the one goodsized but crowded room the younger folk indulged in the amiable inanities proper to the season and now and then old wolf would howl with doleful and spinetickling ominousness at some especially spectral strain from lafayettes squeaky violina device he had never heard before mostly though this battered veteran slept through the merriment for he was past the age of active interests and lived largely in his dreams tom and jennie rigby had brought their collie zeke along but the canines did not fraternise zeke seemed strangely uneasy over something and nosed around curiously all the eveningaudrey and walker made a fine couple on the floor and grandma compton still likes to recall her impression of their dancing that night their worries seemed forgotten for the nonce and walker was shaved and trimmed into a surprising degree of spruceness by ten oclock all hands were healthily tired and the guests began to depart family by family with many handshakings and bluff assurances of what a fine time everybody had had tom and jennie thought zekes eerie howls as he followed them to their wagon were marks of regret at having to go home though audrey said it must be the faraway tomtoms which annoyed him for the distant thumping was surely ghastly enough after the merriment withinthe night was bitterly cold and for the first time walker put a great log in the fireplace and banked it with ashes to keep it smouldering till morning old wolf dragged himself within the ruddy glow and lapsed into his customary coma audrey and walker too tired to think of charms or curses tumbled into the rough pine bed and were asleep before the cheap alarmclock on the mantel had ticked out three minutes and from far away the rhythmic pounding of those hellish tomtoms still pulsed on the chill nightwinddr mcneill paused here and removed his glasses as if a blurring of the objective world might make the reminiscent vision cleareryoull soon appreciate he said that i had a great deal of difficulty in piecing out all that happened after the guests left there were times thoughat firstwhen i was able to make a try at it after a moment of silence he went on with the taleaudrey had terrible dreams of yig who appeared to her in the guise of satan as depicted in cheap engravings she had seen it was indeed from an absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she started suddenly awake to find walker already conscious and sitting up in bed he seemed to be listening intently to something and silenced her with a whisper when she began to ask what had roused himhark aud he breathed dont ye hear somethin asingin and buzzin and rustlin dye reckon its the fall cricketscertainly there was distinctly audible within the cabin such a sound as he had described audrey tried to analyse it and was impressed with some element at once horrible and familiar which hovered just outside the rim of her memory and beyond it all waking a hideous thought the monotonous beating of the distant tomtoms came incessantly across the black plains on which a cloudy halfmoon had setwalkerspose itsthethecurse o yigshe could feel him trembleno gal i dont reckon he comes that away hes shapen like a man except ye look at him clost thats what chief grey eagle says this heres some varmints come in outen the coldnot crickets i calclate but summat like em id orter git up and stomp em out afore they make much headway or git at the cupboardhe rose felt for the lantern that hung within easy reach and rattled the tin matchbox nailed to the wall beside it audrey sat up in bed and watched the flare of the match grow into the steady glow of the lantern then as their eyes began to take in the whole of the room the crude rafters shook with the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek for the flat rocky floor revealed in the newborn illumination was one seething brownspeckled mass of wriggling rattlesnakes slithering toward the fire and even now turning their loathsome heads to menace the frightblasted lanternbearerit was only for an instant that audrey saw the things the reptiles were of every size of uncountable numbers and apparently of several varieties and even as she looked two or three of them reared their heads as if to strike at walker she did not faintit was walkers crash to the floor that extinguished the lantern and plunged her into blackness he had not screamed a second timefright had paralysed him and he fell as if shot by a silent arrow from no mortals bow to audrey the entire world seemed to whirl about fantastically mingling with the nightmare from which she had startedvoluntary motion of any sort was impossible for will and the sense of reality had left her she fell back inertly on her pillow hoping that she would wake soon no actual sense of what had happened penetrated her mind for some time then little by little the suspicion that she was really awake began to dawn on her and she was convulsed with a mounting blend of panic and grief which made her long to shriek out despite the inhibiting spell which kept her mutewalker was gone and she had not been able to help him he had died of snakes just as the old witchwoman had predicted when he was a little boy poor wolf had not been able to help eitherprobably he had not even awaked from his senile stupor and now the crawling things must be coming for her writhing closer and closer every moment in the dark perhaps even now twining slipperily about the bedposts and oozing up over the coarse woollen blankets unconsciously she crept under the clothes and trembledit must be the curse of yig he had sent his monstrous children on allhallows night and they had taken walker first why was thatwasnt he innocent enough why not come straight for herhadnt she killed those little rattlers alone then she thought of the curses form as told by the indians she wouldnt be killedjust turned to a spotted snake ugh so she would be like those things she had glimpsed on the floorthose things which yig had sent to get her and enroll her among their number she tried to mumble a charm that walker had taught her but found she could not utter a single soundthe noisy ticking of the alarmclock sounded above the maddening beat of the distant tomtoms the snakes were taking a long timedid they mean to delay on purpose to play on her nerves every now and then she thought she felt a steady insidious pressure on the bedclothes but each time it turned out to be only the automatic twitchings of her overwrought nerves the clock ticked on in the dark and a change came slowly over her thoughtsthose snakescouldnthave taken so long they couldnt be yigs messengers after all but just natural rattlers that were nested below the rock and had been drawn there by the fire they werent coming for her perhapsperhaps they had sated themselves on poor walker where were they now gone coiled by the fire still crawling over the prone corpse of their victim the clock ticked and the distant drums throbbed onat the thought of her husbands body lying there in the pitch blackness a thrill of purely physical horror passed over audrey that story of sally comptons about the man back in scott county he too had been bitten by a whole bunch of rattlesnakes and what had happened to him the poison had rotted the flesh and swelled the whole corpse and in the end the bloated thing hadbursthorriblyburst horribly with a detestable popping noise was that what was happening to walker down there on the rock floor instinctively she felt she had begun tolistenfor something too terrible even to name to herselfthe clock ticked on keeping a kind of mocking sardonic time with the faroff drumming that the nightwind brought she wished it were a striking clock so that she could know how long this eldritch vigil must last she cursed the toughness of fibre that kept her from fainting and wondered what sort of relief the dawn could bring after all probably neighbours would passno doubt somebody would callwould they find her still sane was she still sane nowmorbidly listening audrey all at once became aware of something which she had to verify with every effort of her will before she could believe it and which once verified she did not know whether to welcome or dreadthe distant beating of the indian tomtoms had ceasedthey had always maddened herbut had not walker regarded them as a bulwark against nameless evil from outside the universe what were some of those things he had repeated to her in whispers after talking with grey eagle and the wichita medicinemenshe did not relish this new and sudden silence after all there was something sinister about it the loudticking clock seemed abnormal in its new loneliness capable at last of conscious motion she shook the covers from her face and looked into the darkness toward the window it must have cleared after the moon set for she saw the square aperture distinctly against the background of starsthen without warning came that shocking unutterable soundughthat dull putridpopof cleft skin and escaping poison in the dark godsallys storythat obscene stench and this gnawing clawing silence it was too much the bonds of muteness snapped and the black night waxed reverberant with audreys screams of stark unbridled frenzyconsciousness did not pass away with the shock how merciful if only it had amidst the echoes of her shrieking audrey still saw the starsprinkled square of window ahead and heard the doomboding ticking of that frightful clock did she hear another sound was that square window still a perfect square she was in no condition to weigh the evidence of her senses or distinguish between fact and hallucinationnothat window was not a perfect squaresomething had encroached on the lower edgenor was the ticking of the clock the only sound in the room there was beyond dispute a heavy breathing neither her own nor poor wolfs wolf slept very silently and his wakeful wheezing was unmistakable then audrey saw against the stars the black daemoniac silhouette of something anthropoidthe undulant bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders fumbling slowly toward heryaaaah yaaaah go away go away go away snakedevil go way yig i didnt mean to kill emi was feared hed be scairt of em dont yig dont i didnt go for to hurt yore chillendont come nigh medont change me into no spotted snakebut the halfformless head and shoulders only lurched onward toward the bed very silentlyeverything snapped at once inside audreys head and in a second she had turned from a cowering child to a raging madwoman she knew where the axe washung against the wall on those pegs near the lantern it was within easy reach and she could find it in the dark before she was conscious of anything further it was in her hands and she was creeping toward the foot of the bedtoward the monstrous head and shoulders that every moment groped their way nearer had there been any light the look on her face would not have been pleasant to seetakethatyou andthatandthatandthatshe was laughing shrilly now and her cackles mounted higher as she saw that the starlight beyond the window was yielding to the dim prophetic pallor of coming dawndr mcneill wiped the perspiration from his forehead and put on his glasses again i waited for him to resume and as he kept silent i spoke softlyshe lived she was found was it ever explainedthe doctor cleared his throatyesshe lived in a way and it was explained i told you there was no bewitchmentonly cruel pitiful material horrorit was sally compton who had made the discovery she had ridden over to the davis cabin the next afternoon to talk over the party with audrey and had seen no smoke from the chimney that was queer it had turned very warm again yet audrey was usually cooking something at that hour the mules were making hungrysounding noises in the barn and there was no sign of old wolf sunning himself in the accustomed spot by the dooraltogether sally did not like the look of the place so was very timid and hesitant as she dismounted and knocked she got no answer but waited some time before trying the crude door of split logs the lock it appeared was unfastened and she slowly pushed her way in then perceiving what was there she reeled back gasped and clung to the jamb to preserve her balancea terrible odour had welled out as she opened the door but that was not what had stunned her it was what she had seen for within that shadowy cabin monstrous things had happened and three shocking objects remained on the floor to awe and baffle the beholdernear the burnedout fireplace was the great dogpurple decay on the skin left bare by mange and old age and the whole carcass burst by the puffing effect of rattlesnake poison it must have been bitten by a veritable legion of the reptilesto the right of the door was the axehacked remnant of what had been a manclad in a nightshirt and with the shattered bulk of a lantern clenched in one handhe was totally free from any sign of snakebitenear him lay the ensanguined axe carelessly discardedand wriggling flat on the floor was a loathsome vacanteyed thing that had been a woman but was now only a mute mad caricature all that this thing could do was to hiss and hiss and hissboth the doctor and i were brushing cold drops from our foreheads by this time he poured something from a flask on his desk took a nip and handed another glass to me i could only suggest tremulously and stupidlyso walker had only fainted that first timethe screams roused him and the axe did the restyes dr mcneills voice was low but he met his death from snakes just the same it was his fear working in two waysit made him faint and it made him fill his wife with the wild stories that caused her to strike out when she thought she saw the snakedevili thought for a momentand audreywasnt it queer how the curse of yig

i am writing this under an appreciable mental strain since by tonight i shall be no more penniless and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable i can bear the torture no longer and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below do not think from my slavery to morphine that i am a weakling or a degenerate when you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may guess though never fully realise why it is that i must have forgetfulness or deathit was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad pacific that the packet of which i was supercargo fell a victim to the german searaider the great war was then at its very beginning and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners so liberal indeed was the discipline of our captors that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of timewhen i finally found myself adrift and free i had but little idea of my surroundings never a competent navigator i could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that i was somewhat south of the equator of the longitude i knew nothing and no island or coastline was in sight the weather kept fair and for uncounted days i drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun waiting either for some passing ship or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land but neither ship nor land appeared and i began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken bluethe change happened whilst i slept its details i shall never know for my slumber though troubled and dreaminfested was continuous when at last i awaked it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as i could see and in which my boat lay grounded some distance awaythough one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery i was in reality more horrified than astonished for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very core the region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish and of other less describable things which i saw protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain perhaps i should not hope to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren immensity there was nothing within hearing and nothing in sight save a vast reach of black slime yet the very completeness of the stillness and the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fearthe sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its cloudless cruelty as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet as i crawled into the stranded boat i realised that only one theory could explain my position through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths so great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me that i could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean strain my ears as i might nor were there any seafowl to prey upon the dead thingsfor several hours i sat thinking or brooding in the boat which lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens as the day progressed the ground lost some of its stickiness and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time that night i slept but little and the next day i made for myself a pack containing food and water preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescueon the third morning i found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease the odour of the fish was maddening but i was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil and set out boldly for an unknown goal all day i forged steadily westward guided by a faraway hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert that night i encamped and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when i had first espied it by the fourth evening i attained the base of the mound which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface too weary to ascend i slept in the shadow of the hilli know not why my dreams were so wild that night but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain i was awake in a cold perspiration determined to sleep no more such visions as i had experienced were too much for me to endure again and in the glow of the moon i saw how unwise i had been to travel by day without the glare of the parching sun my journey would have cost me less energy indeed i now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset picking up my pack i started for the crest of the eminencei have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me but i think my horror was greater when i gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to illumine i felt myself on the edge of the world peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night through my terror ran curious reminiscences ofparadise lostand of satans hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darknessas the moon climbed higher in the sky i began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as i had imagined ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet the declivity became very gradual urged on by an impulse which i cannot definitely analyse i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had yet penetratedall at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope which rose steeply about an hundred yards ahead of me an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon that it was merely a gigantic piece of stone i soon assured myself but i was conscious of a distinct impression that its contour and position were not altogether the work of nature a closer scrutiny filled me with sensations i cannot express for despite its enormous magnitude and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the world was young i perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a wellshaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking creaturesdazed and frightened yet not without a certain thrill of the scientists or archaeologists delight i examined my surroundings more closely the moon now near the zenith shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm and revealed the fact that a farflung body of water flowed at the bottom winding out of sight in both directions and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the slope across the chasm the wavelets washed the base of the cyclopean monolith on whose surface i could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures the writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to me and unlike anything i had ever seen in books consisting for the most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes eels octopi crustaceans molluscs whales and the like several characters obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern world but whose decomposing forms i had observed on the oceanrisen plainit was the pictorial carving however that did most to hold me spellbound plainly visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size were an array of basreliefs whose subjects would have excited the envy of a dor i think that these things were supposed to depict menat least a certain sort of men though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well of their faces and forms i dare not speak in detail for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint grotesque beyond the imagination of a poe or a bulwer they were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet shockingly wide and flabby lips glassy bulging eyes and other features less pleasant to recall curiously enough they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background for one of the creatures was shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself i remarked as i say their grotesqueness and strange size but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the piltdown or neanderthal man was born awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist i stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before methen suddenly i saw it with only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface the thing slid into view above the dark waters vast polyphemuslike and loathsome it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds i think i went mad thenof my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat i remember little i believe i sang a great deal and laughed oddly when i was unable to sing i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat at any rate i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moodswhen i came out of the shadows i was in a san francisco hospital brought thither by the captain of the american ship which had picked up my boat in midocean in my delirium i had said much but found that my words had been given scant attention of any land upheaval in the pacific my rescuers knew nothing nor did i deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which i knew they could not believe once i sought out a celebrated ethnologist and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient philistine legend of dagon the fishgod but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional i did not press my inquiriesit is at night especially when the moon is gibbous and waning that i see the thing i tried morphine but the drug has given only transient surcease and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave so now i am to end it all having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellowmen often i ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasma mere freak of fever as i lay sunstricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the german manofwar this i ask myself but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply i cannot think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of watersoaked granite i dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny warexhausted mankindof a day when the land shall sink and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemoniumthe end is near i hear a noise at the door as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it it shall not find me godthat handthe window the window,1
a little after noon on the twentyeighth day of june 1924 dr morehouse stopped his machine before the tanner place and four men alighted the stone building in perfect repair and freshness stood near the road and but for the swamp in the rear it would have possessed no trace of dark suggestion the spotless white doorway was visible across a trim lawn for some distance down the road and as the doctors party approached it could be seen that the heavy portal yawned wide open only the screen door was closed the proximity of the house had imposed a kind of nervous silence on the four men for what lurked therein could only be imagined with vague terror this terror underwent a marked abatement when the explorers heard distinctly the sound of richard blakes typewriterless than an hour before a grown man had fled from that house hatless coatless and screaming to fall upon the doorstep of his nearest neighbor half a mile away babbling incoherently of house dark swamp and room dr morehouse had needed no further spur to excited action when told that a slavering maddened creature had burst out of the old tanner home by the edge of the swamp he had known that something would happen when the two men had taken the accursed stone housethe man who had fled and his master richard blake the authorpoet from boston the genius who had gone into the war with every nerve and sense alert and had come out as he was now still debonair though half a paralytic still walking with song among the sights and sounds of living fantasy though shut forever from the physical world deaf dumb and blindblake had reveled in the weird traditions and shuddering hints about the house and its former tenants such eldritch lore was an imaginative asset from whose enjoyment his physical state might not bar him he had smiled at the prognostications of the superstitious natives now with his sole companion fled in a mad ecstasy of panic fright and himself left helpless with whatever had caused that fright blake might have less occasion to revel and smile this at least was dr morehouses reflection as he had faced the problem of the fugitive and called on the puzzled cottager to help him track the matter down the morehouses were an old fenham family and the doctors grandfather had been one of those who burned the hermit simeon tanners body in 1819 not even at this distance could the trained physician escape a spinal tingle at what was recorded of that burningat the naive inferences drawn by ignorant countrymen from a slight and meaningless conformation of the deceased that tingle he knew to be foolish for trifling bony protuberances on the fore part of the skull are of no significance and often observable in baldheaded menamong the four men who ultimately set resolute faces toward that abhorrent house in the doctors care there occurred a singularly awed exchange of vague legends and halffurtive scraps of gossip handed down from curious grandmotherslegends and hints seldom repeated and almost never systematically compared they extended as far back as 1692 when a tanner had perished on gallows hill in salem after a witchcraft trial but did not grow intimate till the time the house was built1747 though the ell was more recent not even then were the tales very numerous for queer though the tanners all were it was only the last of them old simeon whom people desperately feared he added to what he had inheritedadded horribly everyone whisperedand bricked up the windows of the southeast room whose east wall gave on the swamp that was his study and library and it had a door of double thickness with braces it had been chopped through with axes that terrible winter night in 1819 when the stinking smoke had poured from the chimney and they found tanners body in therewith that expression on its face it was because of that expressionnot because of the two bony protuberances beneath the bushy white hairthat they had burned the body and the books and manuscripts it had had in that room however the short distance to the tanner place was covered before much important historical matter could be correlatedas the doctor at the head of the party opened the screen door and entered the arched hallway it was noticed that the sound of typewriting had suddenly ceased at this point two of the men also thought they noticed a faint effusion of cold air strangely out of keeping with the great heat of the day though they afterward refused to swear to this the hall was in perfect order as were the various rooms entered in quest of the study where blake was presumably to be found the author had furnished his home in exquisite colonial taste and though having no help but the one manservant he had succeeded in maintaining it in a state of commendable neatnessdr morehouse led his men from room to room through the wideopen doors and archways at last finding the library or study which he soughta fine southerly room on the ground floor adjoining the oncedreaded study of simeon tanner lined with the books which the servant communicated through an ingenious alphabet of touches and the bulky braille volumes which the author himself read with sensitive fingertips richard blake of course was there seated as usual before his typewriter with a draftscattered stack of newly written pages on the table and floor and one sheet still in the machine he had stopped work it appeared with some suddenness perhaps because of a chill which had caused him to draw together the neck of his dressinggown and his head was turned toward the doorway of the sunny adjoining room in a manner quite singular for one whose lack of sight and hearing shuts out all sense of the external worldon drawing nearer and crossing to where he could see the authors face dr morehouse turned very pale and motioned to the others to stand back he needed time to steady himself and to dispel all possibility of hideous illusion no longer did he need to speculate why they had burned old simeon tanners body on that wintry night because of theexpressionit wore for here was something only a welldisciplined mind could confront the late richard blake whose typewriter had ceased its nonchalant clicking only as the men had entered the house had seen something despite his blindness and had been affected by it humanity had nothing to do with the look that was on his face or with the glassy morbid vision that blazed in great blue bloodshot eyes shut to this worlds images for six years those eyes were fixed with an ecstasy of clearsighted horror on the doorway leading to simeon tanners old study where the sun blazed on walls once shrouded in brickedup blackness and dr arlo morehouse reeled dizzily when he saw that for all the dazzling daylight the inky pupils of those eyes were dilated as cavernously as those of a cats eyes in the darkthe doctor closed the staring blind eyes before he let the others view the face of the corpse meanwhile he examined the lifeless form with feverish diligence using scrupulous technical care despite his throbbing nerves and almost shaking hands some of his results he communicated from time to time to the awed and inquisitive trio around him other results he judiciously withheld lest they lead to speculations more disquieting than human speculations should be it was not from any word of his but from shrewd independent observation that one of the men muttered about the bodys tousled black hair and the way the papers were scattered this man said it was as if a strong breeze had blown through the open doorway which the dead man faced whereas although the oncebricked windows beyond were indeed fully open to the warm june air there had been scarcely a breath of wind during the entire daywhen one of the men began to gather the sheets of newly written manuscript as they lay on floor and table dr morehouse stopped him with an alarmed gesture he had seen the sheet that remained in the machine and had hastily removed and pocketed it after a sentence or two blanched his face afresh this incident prompted him to collect the scattered sheets himself and stuff them bulkily into an inside pocket without stopping to arrange them and not even what he had read terrified him half so much as what he now noticedthe subtle difference in touch and heaviness of typing which distinguished the sheets he picked up from the one he had found on the typewriter this shadowy impression he could not divorce from that other horrible circumstance which he was so zealously concealing from the men who had heard the machines clicking not ten minutes beforethe circumstance he was trying to exclude from even his own mind till he could be alone and resting in the merciful depths of his morris chair one may judge of the fear he felt at that circumstance by considering what he braved to keep it suppressed in more than thirty years of professional practice he had never regarded a medical examiner as one from whom a fact might be withheld yet through all the formalities which now followed no man ever knew that when he examined this staring contorted blind mans body he had seen at oncethat death must have occurred at least half an hour before discoverydr morehouse presently closed the outer door and led the party through every corner of the ancient structure in search of any evidence which might directly illuminate the tragedy never was a result more completely negative he knew that the trapdoor of old simeon tanner had been removed as soon as that recluses books and body had been burnt and that the subcellar and the sinuous tunnel under the swamp had been filled up as soon as they were discovered some thirtyfive years later now he saw that no fresh abnormalities had come to replace them and that the whole establishment exhibited only the normal neatness of modern restoration and tasteful caretelephoning for the sheriff at fenham and for the county medical examiner at bayboro he awaited the arrival of the former who when he came insisted on swearing in two of the men as deputies until the examiner should arrive dr morehouse knowing the mystification and futility confronting the officials could not help smiling wryly as he left with the villager whose house still sheltered the man who had fledthey found the patient exceedingly weak but conscious and fairly composed having promised the sheriff to extract and transmit all possible information from the fugitive dr morehouse began some calm and tactful questioning which was received in a rational and compliant spirit and baffled only by effacement of memory much of the mans quiet must have come from merciful inability to recollect for all he could now tell was that he had been in the study with his master and had seemed to see the next room suddenly grow darkthe room where sunshine had for more than a hundred years replaced the gloom of brickedup windows even this memory which indeed he half doubted greatly disturbed the unstrung nerves of the patient and it was with the utmost gentleness and circumspection that dr morehouse told him his master was deada natural victim of the cardiac weakness which his terrible wartime injuries must have caused the man was grieved for he had been devoted to the crippled author but he promised to show fortitude in taking the body back to the family in boston after the close of the medical examiners formal inquirythe physician after satisfying as vaguely as possible the curiosity of the householder and his wife and urging them to shelter the patient and keep him from the tanner house until his departure with the body next drove home in a growing tremble of excitement at last he was free to read the typed manuscript of the dead man and to gain at least an inkling of what hellish thing had defied those shattered senses of sight and sound and penetrated so disastrously to the delicate intelligence that brooded in external darkness and silence he knew it would be a grotesque and terrible perusal and he did not hasten to begin it instead he very deliberately put his car in the garage made himself comfortable in a dressinggown and placed a stand of sedative and restorative medicines beside the great chair he was to occupy even after that he obviously wasted time as he slowly arranged the numbered sheets carefully avoiding any comprehensive glance at their textwhat the manuscript did to dr morehouse we all know it would never have been read by another had his wife not picked it up as he lay inert in his chair an hour later breathing heavily and unresponsive to a knocking which one would have thought violent enough to arouse a mummied pharaoh terrible as the document is particularly in the obviouschange of stylenear the end we cannot avoid the belief that to the folklorewise physician it presented someadded and supreme horrorwhich no other will ever be so unfortunate as to receive certainly it is the general opinion of fenham that the doctors wide familiarity with the mutterings of old people and the tales his grandfather told him in youth furnished him some special information in the light of which richard blakes hideous chronicle acquired a new clear and devastating significance nearly insupportable to the normal human mind that would explain the slowness of his recovery on that june evening the reluctance with which he permitted his wife and son to read the manuscript the singular illgrace with which he acceded to their determination not to burn a document so darkly remarkable and most of all the peculiar rashness with which he hastened to purchase the old tanner property destroy the house with dynamite and cut down the trees of the swamp for a substantial distance from the road concerning the whole subject he now maintains an inflexible reticence and it is certain that there will die with him a knowledge without which the world is better offthe manuscript as here appended was copied through the courtesy of floyd morehouse esq son of the physician a few omissions indicated by asterisks have been made in the interest of the public peace of mind still others have been occasioned by the indefiniteness of the text where the stricken authors lightninglike touchtyping seems shaken into incoherence or ambiguity in three places where lacunae are fairly well elucidated by the context the task of recension has been attempted of thechange in stylenear the end it were best to say nothing surely it is plausible enough to attribute the phenomenon as regards both content and physical aspect of typing to the racked and tottering mind of a victim whose former handicaps had paled to nothing before that which he now faced bolder minds are at liberty to supply their own deductionshere then is the document written in an accursed house by a brain closed to the worlds sights and soundsa brain left alone and unwarned to the mercies and mockeries of powers that no seeing hearing man has ever stayed to face contradictory as it is to all that we know of the universe through physics chemistry and biology the logical mind will classify it as a singular product of dementiaa dementia communicated in some sympathetic way to the man who burst out of that house in time and thus indeed may it very well be regarded so long as dr arlo morehouse maintains his silencethe manuscriptvague misgivings of the last quarter hour are now becoming definite fears to begin with i am thoroughly convinced that something must have happened to dobbs for the first time since we have been together he has failed to answer my summons when he did not respond to my repeated ringing i decided that the bell must be out of order but i have pounded on the table with vigor enough to rouse a charge of charon at first i thought he might have slipped out of the house for a breath of fresh air for it has been hot and sultry all the forenoon but it is not like dobbs to stay away so long without first making sure that i would want nothing it is however the unusual occurrence of the last few minutes which confirms my suspicion that dobbss absence is a matter beyond his control it is this same happening which prompts me to put my impressions and conjectures on paper in the hope that the mere act of recording them may relieve a certain sinister suggestion of impending tragedy try as i will i cannot free my mind from the legends connected with this old housemere superstitious folderol for dwarfed brains to revel in and on which i would not even waste a thought if dobbs were herethrough the years that i have been shut away from the world i used to know dobbs has been my sixth sense now for the first time since my incapacitation i realize the full extent of my impotency it is dobbs who had compensated for my sightless eyes my useless ears my voiceless throat and my crippled legs there is a glass of water on my typewriter table without dobbs to fill it when it has been emptied my plight will be like that of tantalus few have come to this house since we have lived herethere is little in common between garrulous country folk and a paralytic who cannot see hear or speak to themit may be days before anyone else appears alone with only my thoughts to keep me company disquieting thoughts which have been in no wise assuaged by the sensations of the last few minutes i do not like these sensations either for more and more they are converting mere village gossip into a fantastic imagery which affects my emotions in a most peculiar and almost unprecedented mannerit seems hours since i started to write this but i know it can be only a few minutes for i have just inserted this fresh page into the machine the mechanical action of switching the sheets brief though it was has given me a fresh grip on myself perhaps i can shake off this sense of approaching danger long enough to recount that which has already happenedat first it was no more than a mere tremor somewhat similar to the shivering of a cheap tenement block when a heavy truck rumbles close by the curbbut this is no loosely built frame structure perhaps i am supersensitive to such things and it may be that i am allowing my imagination to play tricks but it seemed to me that the disturbance was more pronounced directly in front of meand my chair faces the southeast wing away from the road directly in line with the swamp at the rear of the dwelling delusion though this may have been there is no denying what followed i was reminded of moments when i have felt the ground tremble beneath my feet at the bursting of giant shells times when i have seen ships tossed like chaff before the fury of a typhoon the house shook like a dweurgarian cinder in the sieves of niflheim every timber in the floor beneath my feet quivered like a suffering thing my typewriter trembled till i could imagine that the keys were chattering of their feara brief moment and it was over everything is as calm as before altogether too calm it seems impossible that such a thing could happen and yet leave everything exactly as it was before no not exactlyi am thoroughly convinced that something has happened to dobbs it is this conviction added to this unnatural calm which accentuates the premonitory fear that persists in creeping over me fear yesthough i am trying to reason sanely with myself that there is nothing of which to be afraid critics have both praised and condemned my poetry because of what they term a vivid imagination at such a time as this i can heartily agree with those who cry too vivid nothing can be very much amiss or smoke just a faint sulfurous trace but one which is unmistakable to my keenly attuned nostrils so faint indeed that it is impossible for me to determine whether it comes from some part of the house or drifts through the window of the adjoining room which opens on the swamp the impression is rapidly becoming more clearly defined i am sure now that it does not come from outside vagrant visions of the past somber scenes of other days flash before me in stereoscopic review a flaming factory hysterical screams of terrified women penned in by walls of fire a blazing schoolhouse pitiful cries of helpless children trapped by collapsing stairs a theatre fire frantic babel of panicstricken people fighting to freedom over blistering floors and over all impenetrable clouds of black noxious malicious smoke polluting the peaceful sky the air of the room is saturated with thick heavy stifling waves at any moment i expect to feel hot tongues of flame lick eagerly at my useless legs my eyes smart my ears throb i cough and choke to rid my lungs of the ocypetean fumes smoke such as is associated only with appalling catastrophes acrid stinking mephitic smoke permeated with the revolting odor of burning flesh once more i am alone with this portentous calm the welcome breeze that fans my cheeks is fast restoring my vanished courage clearly the house cannot be on fire for every vestige of the torturous smoke is gone i cannot detect a single trace of it though i have been sniffing like a bloodhound i am beginning to wonder if i am going mad if the years of solitude have unhinged my mindbut the phenomenon has been too definite to permit me to class it as mere hallucination sane or insane i cannot conceive these things as aught but actualitiesand the moment i catalogue them as such i can come to only one logical conclusion the inference in itself is enough to upset ones mental stability to concede this is to grant the truth of the superstitious rumors which dobbs compiled from the villagers and transcribed for my sensitive fingertips to readunsubstantial hearsay that my materialistic mind instinctively condemns as asininityi wish the throbbing in my ears would stop it is as if mad spectral players were beating a duet upon the aching drums i suppose it is merely a reaction to the suffocating sensations i have just experienced a few more deep drafts of this refreshing air somethingsomeone is in the room i am as sure i am no longer alone as if i could see the presence i sense so infallibly it is an impression quite similar to one which i have had while elbowing my way through a crowded streetthe definite notion that eyes were singling me out from the rest of the throng with a gaze intense enough to arrest my subconscious attentionthe same sensation only magnified a thousandfold whowhatcan it be after all my fears may be groundless perhaps it means only that dobbs has returned no it is not dobbs as i anticipated the tattoo upon my ears has ceased and a low whisper has caught my attention the overwhelming significance of the thing has just registered itself upon my bewildered brain i can hearit is not a single whispering voice but many lecherous buzzing of bestial blowflies satanic humming of libidinous bees sibilant hissing of obscene reptiles a whispering chorus no human throat could sing it is gaining in volume the room rings with demoniacal chanting tuneless toneless and grotesquely grim a diabolical choir rehearsing unholy litanies paeans of mephistophelian misery set to music of wailing souls a hideous crescendo of pagan pandemonium the voices that surround me are drawing closer to my chair the chanting has come to an abrupt end and the whispering has resolved itself into intelligible sounds i strain my ears to distinguish the words closer and still closer they are clear nowtoo clear better had my ears been blocked forever than forced to listen to their hellish mouthings impious revelations of soulsickening saturnalia ghoulish conceptions of devastating debaucheries profane bribes of cabirian orgies malevolent threats of unimagined punishments it is cold unseasonably cold as if inspired by the cacodemoniacal presences that harass me the breeze that was so friendly a few minutes ago growls angrily about my earsan icy gale that rushes in from the swamp and chills me to the boneif dobbs has deserted me i do not blame him i hold no brief for cowardice or craven fear but there are some things i only hope his fate has been nothing worse than to have departed in timemy last doubt is swept away i am doubly glad now that i have held to my resolve to write down my impressions not that i expect anyone to understand or believe it has been a relief from the maddening strain of idly waiting for each new manifestation of psychic abnormality as i see it there are but three courses that may be taken to flee from this accursed place and spend the torturous years that lie ahead in trying to forgetbut flee icannotto yield to an abominable alliance with forces so malign that tartarus to them would seem but an alcove of paradisebut yield iwill notto diefar rather would i have my body torn limb from limb than to contaminate my soul in barbarous barter with such emissaries of belial i have had to pause for a moment to blow upon my fingers the room is cold with the foetid frigor of the tomb a peaceful numbness is creeping over me i must fight off this lassitude it is undermining my determination to die rather than give in to the insidious importunings i vow anew to resist until the end the end that i know cannot be far away the wind is colder than ever if such a thing be possible a wind freighted with the stench of deadalive things o merciful god who took my sight a wind so cold it burns where it should freeze it has become a blistering sirocco unseen fingers grip me ghost fingers that lack the physical strength to force me from my machine icy fingers that force me into a vile vortex of vice devilfingers that draw me down into a cesspool of eternal iniquity death fingers that shut off my breath and make my sightless eyes feel they must burst with the pain frozen points press against my temples hard bony knobs akin to horns boreal breath of some longdead thing kisses my fevered lips and sears my hot throat with frozen flame it is dark not the darkness that is part of years of blindness the impenetrable darkness of sinsteeped night the pitchblack darkness of purgatory i see spes mea christus it is the end not for mortal mind is any resisting of force beyond human imagination not for immortal spirit is any conquering of that which hath probed the depths and made of immortality a transient moment the end nay it is but the blissful beginning,1
in london there is a man who screams when the church bells ring he lives all alone with his streaked cat in grays inn and people call him harmlessly mad his room is filled with books of the tamest and most puerile kind and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble pages all he seeks from life is not to think for some reason thought is very horrible to him and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague he is very thin and grey and wrinkled but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks fear has its grisly claws upon him and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and sweatbeaded forehead friends and companions he shuns for he wishes to answer no questions those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now he dropped them all years ago and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway it is a decade now since he moved into grays inn and of where he had been he would say nothing till the night young williams bought thenecronomiconwilliams was a dreamer and only twentythree and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room he forced his friendship where old friends dared not force theirs and marvelled at the fright that sat upon this gaunt haggard watcher and listener for that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay insipid novels and when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and scream and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last peal died reverberantly awaybut try as williams would he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or hidden the old man would not live up to his aspect and manner but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto that his learning was deep and thorough his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear and williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to harrow and oxford later it developed that he was none other than lord northam of whose ancient hereditary castle on the yorkshire coast so many odd things were told but when williams tried to talk of the castle and of its reputed roman origin he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it he even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the north sea was brought upso matters went till that night when williams brought home the infamousnecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred he had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in chandos street and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it the old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful blackletter but now at last he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure it was at a jews shop in the squalid precincts of clare market where he had often bought strange things before and he almost fancied the gnarled old levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made the bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible and the price was so absurdly slightthe one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports and some of the diagrams set in the vague latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain he felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old jew chuckled disturbingly behind him but when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of blackletter and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist and reluctantly called on his strange frightened friend for help with the twisted mediaeval latin lord northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat and started violently when the young man entered then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly and fainted altogether when williams uttered the title it was when he regained his senses that he told his story told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashesthere must lord northam whispered have been something wrong at the start but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far he was the nineteenth baron of a line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the pastunbelievably far if vague tradition could be heeded for there were family tales of a descent from presaxon times when a certain cnaeus gabinius capito military tribune in the third augustan legion then stationed at lindum in roman britain had been summarily expelled from his command for participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion gabinius had the rumour ran come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the elder sign in the dark strange folk whom the britons knew not save in fear and who were the last to survive from a great land in the west that had sunk leaving only the islands with the raths and circles and shrines of which stonehenge was the greatest there was no certainty of course in the legend that gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a line which pict and saxon dane and norman were powerless to obliterate or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the black prince whom edward third created baron of northam these things were not certain yet they were often told and in truth the stonework of northam keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of hadrians wall as a child lord northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for halfamorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience he became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying a searcher for strange realms and relationships once familiar yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earthfilled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and ominous and that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the known at every point northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult mystery nowhere however could he find ease and content and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him during the nineties he dabbled in satanism and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of nature books like ignatius donnellys chimerical account of atlantis he absorbed with zest and a dozen obscure precursors of charles fort enthralled him with their vagaries he would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder and once went into the desert of araby to seek a nameless city of faint report which no man has ever beheld there rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed which if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back of his memory it might be in the visible world yet it might be only in his mind and soul perhaps he held within his own halfexplored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions which would bind him to the stars and to the infinities and eternities beyond them,1
editors note alonzo hasbrouck typer of kingston ny was last seen and recognised on april 17 1908 around noon at the hotel richmond in batavia he was the only survivor of an ancient ulster county family and was fiftythree years old at the time of his disappearancemr typer was educated privately and at columbia and heidelberg universities all his life was spent as a student the field of his researches including many obscure and generally feared borderlands of human knowledge his papers on vampirism ghouls and poltergeist phenomena were privately printed after rejection by many publishers he resigned from the society for psychical research in 1902 after a series of peculiarly bitter controversiesat various times mr typer travelled extensively sometimes dropping out of sight for long periods he is known to have visited obscure spots in nepal india thibet and indochina and passed most of the year 1899 on mysterious easter island the extensive search for mr typer after his disappearance yielded no results and his estate was divided among distant cousins in new york citythe diary herewith presented was allegedly found in the ruins of a large country house near attica ny which had borne a curiously sinister reputation for generations before its collapse the edifice was very old antedating the general white settlement of the region and had formed the home of a strange and secretive family named van der heyl which had migrated from albany in 1746 under a curious cloud of witchcraft suspicion the structure probably dated from about 1760of the history of the van der heyls very little is known they remained entirely aloof from their normal neighbours employed negro servants brought directly from africa and speaking little english and educated their children privately and at european colleges those of them who went out into the world were soon lost to sight though not before gaining evil repute for association with black mass groups and cults of even darker significancearound the dreaded house a straggling village arose populated by indians and later by renegades from the surrounding country which bore the dubious name of chorazin of the singular hereditary strains which afterward appeared in the mixed chorazin villagers several monographs have been written by ethnologists just behind the village and in sight of the van der heyl house is a steep hill crowned with a peculiar ring of ancient standing stones which the iroquois always regarded with fear and loathing the origin and nature of the stones whose date according to archaeological and climatological evidence must be fabulously early is a problem still unsolvedfrom about 1795 onward the legends of the incoming pioneers and later population have much to say about strange cries and chants proceeding at certain seasons from chorazin and from the great house and hill of standing stones though there is reason to suppose that the noises ceased about 1872 when the entire van der heyl householdservants and allsuddenly and simultaneously disappearedthenceforward the house was deserted for other disastrous eventsincluding three unexplained deaths five disappearances and four cases of sudden insanityoccurred when later owners and interested visitors attempted to stay in it the house village and extensive rural areas on all sides reverted to the state and were auctioned off in the absence of discoverable van der heyl heirs since about 1890 the owners successively the late charles a shields and his son oscar s shields of buffalo have left the entire property in a state of absolute neglect and have warned all inquirers not to visit the regionof those known to have approached the house during the last forty years most were occult students police officers newspaper men and odd characters from abroad among the latter was a mysterious eurasian probably from cochinchina whose later appearance with blank mind and bizarre mutilations excited wide press notice in 1903mr typers diarya book about 6 3 inches in size with tough paper and an oddly durable binding of thin sheet metalwas discovered in the possession of one of the decadent chorazin villagers on nov 16 1935 by a state policeman sent to investigate the rumoured collapse of the deserted van der heyl mansion the house had indeed fallen obviously from sheer age and decrepitude in the severe gale of nov 12 disintegration was peculiarly complete and no thorough search of the ruins could be made for several weeks john eagle the swarthy simianfaced indianlike villager who had the diary said that he found the book quite near the surface of the debris in what must have been an upper front roomvery little of the contents of the house could be identified though an enormous and astonishingly solid brick vault in the cellar whose ancient iron door had to be blasted open because of the strangely figured and perversely tenacious lock remained intact and presented several puzzling features for one thing the walls were covered with still undeciphered hieroglyphs roughly incised in the brickwork another peculiarity was a huge circular aperture in the rear of the vault blocked by a cavein evidently caused by the collapse of the housebut strangest of all was the apparentlyrecentdeposit of some foetid slimy pitchblack substance on the flagstoned floor extending in a yardbroad irregular line with one end at the blocked circular aperture those who first opened the vault declared that the place smelled like the snakehouse at a zoothe diary which was apparently designed solely to cover an investigation of the dreaded van der heyl house by the vanished mr typer has been proved by handwriting experts to be genuine the script shews signs of increasing nervous strain as it progresses toward the end in places becoming almost illegible chorazin villagerswhose stupidity and taciturnity baffle all students of the region and its secretsadmit no recollection of mr typer as distinguished from other rash visitors to the dreaded housethe text of the diary is here given verbatim and without comment how to interpret it and what other than the writers madness to infer from it the reader must decide for himself only the future can tell what its value may be in solving a generationold mystery it may be remarked that genealogists confirm mr typers belated memory in the matter ofadriaen sleghtthe diaryapril 17 1908arrived here about 6 pm had to walk all the way from attica in the teeth of an oncoming storm for no one would rent me a horse or rig and i cant run an automobile this place is even worse than i had expected and i dread what is coming even though i long at the same time to learn the secret all too soon will come the nightthe old walpurgis sabbat horrorand after that time in wales i know what to look for whatever comes i shall not flinch prodded by some unfathomable urge i have given my whole life to the quest of unholy mysteries i came here for nothing else and will not quarrel with fateit was very dark when i got here though the sun had by no means set the stormclouds were the densest i had ever seen and i could not have found my way but for the lightning flashes the village is a hateful little backwater and its few inhabitants no better than idiots one of them saluted me in a queer way as if he knew me i could see very little of the landscapejust a small swampy valley of strange brown weedstalks and dead fungi surrounded by scraggly evilly twisted trees with bare boughs but behind the village is a dismallooking hill on whose summit is a circle of great stones with another stone at the centre that without question is the vile primordial thing v told me about at the n estbatthe great house lies in the midst of a park all overgrown with curiouslooking briers i could scarcely break through and when i did the vast age and decrepitude of the building almost stopped me from entering the place looked filthy and diseased and i wondered how so leprous a bulk could hang together it is wooden and though its original lines are hidden by a bewildering tangle of wings added at various dates i think it was first built in the square colonial fashion of new england probably that was easier to build than a dutch stone houseand then too i recall that dirck van der heyls wife was from salem a daughter of the unmentionable abaddon corey there was a small pillared porch and i got under it just as the storm burst it was a fiendish tempestblack as midnight with rain in sheets thunder and lightning like the day of general dissolution and a wind that actually clawed at me the door was unlocked so i took out my electric torch and went inside dust was inches thick on floor and furniture and the place smelled like a mouldcaked tomb there was a hall reaching all the way through and a curving staircase on the right i ploughed a way upstairs and selected this front room to camp out in the whole place seems fully furnished though most of the furniture is breaking down this is written at eight oclock after a cold meal from my travellingcase after this the village people will bring me suppliesthough they wont agree to come any closer than the ruins of the park gate until as they say later i wish i could get rid of an unpleasant feeling of familiarity with this placelateri am conscious of several presences in this house one in particular is decidedly hostile toward mea malevolent will which is seeking to break down my own and overcome me i must not countenance this for an instant but must use all my forces to resist it it is appallingly evil and definitely nonhuman i think it must be allied to powers outside earthpowers in the spaces behind time and beyond the universe it towers like a colossus bearing out what is said in the aklo writings there is such a feeling of vast size connected with it that i wonder these chambers can contain its bulkand yet it has no visible bulk its age must be unutterably vastshockingly indescribably soapril 18slept very little last night at 3 am a strange creeping wind began to pervade the whole regionever rising until the house rocked as if in a typhoon as i went down the staircase to see to the rattling front door the darkness took halfvisible forms in my imagination just below the landing i was pushed violently from behindby the wind i suppose though i could have sworn i saw the dissolving outlines of a gigantic black paw as i turned quickly about i did not lose my footing but safely finished the descent and shot the heavy bolt of the dangerously shaking doori had not meant to explore the house till dawn yet now unable to sleep again and fired with mixed terror and curiosity i felt reluctant to postpone my search with my powerful torch i ploughed through the dust to the great south parlour where i knew the portraits would be there they were just as v had said and as i seemed to know from some obscurer source as well some were so blackened mouldy and dustclouded that i could make little or nothing of them but from those i could trace i recognised that they were indeed of the hateful line of the van der heyls some of the paintings seemed to suggest faces i had known but justwhatfaces i could not recallthe outlines of that frightful hybrid jorisspawned in 1773 by old dircks youngest daughterwere clearest of all and i could trace the green eyes and the serpent look in his face every time i shut off the flashlight that face would seem to glow in the dark until i half fancied it shone with a faint greenish light of its own the more i looked the more evil it seemed and i turned away to avoid hallucinations of changing expressionbut that to which i turned was even worse the long dour face small closely set eyes and swinelike features identified it at once even though the artist had striven to make the snout look as human as possible this was what v had whispered about as i stared in horror i thought the eyes took on a reddish glowand for a moment the background seemed replaced by an alien and seemingly irrelevant scenea lone bleak moor beneath a dirty yellow sky whereon grew a wretchedlooking blackthorn bush fearing for my sanity i rushed from that accursed gallery to the dustcleared corner upstairs where i have my camplaterdecided to explore some of the labyrinthine wings of the house by daylight i cannot get lost for my footprints are distinct in the ankledeep dustand i can trace other identifying marks when necessary it is curious how easily i learn the intricate windings of the corridors followed a long outflung northerly ell to its extremity and came to a locked door which i forced beyond was a very small room quite crowded with furniture and with the panelling badly wormeaten on the outer wall i spied a black space behind the rotting woodwork and discovered a narrow secret passage leading downward to unknown black depths it was a steeply inclined chute or tunnel without steps or handholds and i wondered what its use could have beenabove the fireplace was a mouldy painting which i found on close inspection to be that of a young woman in the dress of the late eighteenth century the face is of classic beauty yet with the most fiendishly evil expression which i have ever known the human countenance to bear not merely callousness greed and cruelty but some quality hideous beyond human comprehension seems to sit upon those finely carved features and as i looked it seemed to me that the artistor the slow processes of mould and decayhad imparted to that pallid complexion a sickly greenish cast and the least suggestion of an almost imperceptibly scaly texture later i ascended to the attic where i found several chests of strange booksmany of utterly alien aspect in letters and in physical form alike one contained variants of the aklo formulae which i had never known to exist i have not yet examined the books on the dusty shelves downstairsapril 19there are certainly unseen presences here even though the dust as yet bears no footprints but my own cut a path through the briers yesterday to the park gate where my supplies are left but this morning i found it closed very odd since the bushes are hardly stirring with spring sap again i had that feeling of something at hand so colossal that the chambers can scarcely contain it this time i feel more than one of the presences is of such a size and i know now that the third aklo ritualwhich i found in that book in the attic yesterdaywould make such beings solid and visible whether i shall dare to try this materialisation remains to be seen the perils are greatlast night i began to glimpse evanescent shadowfaces and forms in the dim corners of the halls and chambersfaces and forms so hideous and loathsome that i dare not describe them they seem allied in substance to that titanic paw which tried to push me down the stairs night before lastand must of course be phantoms of my disturbed imagination what i am seeking would not be quite like these things i have seen the paw againsometimes alone and sometimes with its matebut i have resolved to ignore all such phenomenaearly this afternoon i explored the cellar for the first timedescending by a ladder found in a storeroom since the wooden steps had rotted away the whole place is a mass of nitrous encrustations with amorphous mounds marking the spots where various objects have disintegrated at the farther end is a narrow passage which seems to extend under the northerly ell where i found the little locked room and at the end of this is a heavy brick wall with a locked iron door apparently belonging to a vault of some sort this wall and door bear evidences of eighteenthcentury workmanship and must be contemporary with the oldest additions to the houseclearly prerevolutionary on the lockwhich is obviously older than the rest of the ironworkare engraved certain symbols which i cannot decipherv had not told me about this vault it fills me with a greater disquiet than anything else i have seen for every time i approach it i have an almost irresistible impulse tolistenfor something hitherto no untowardsoundshave marked my stay in this malign place as i left the cellar i wished devoutly that the steps were still therefor my progress up the ladder seemed maddeningly slow i do not want to go down there againand yet some evil genius urges me to try itat nightif i would learn what is to be learnedapril 20i have sounded the depths of horroronly to be made aware of still lower depths last night the temptation was too strong and in the black small hours i descended once more into that nitrous hellish cellar with my flashlighttiptoeing among the amorphous heaps to that terrible brick wall and locked door i made no sound and refrained from whispering any of the incantations i knew but i listenedlistened with mad intentnessat last i heard the sounds from beyond those barred plates of sheet ironthe menacing padding and muttering as of gigantic nightthings within then too there was a damnable slithering as of a vast serpent or seabeast dragging its monstrous folds over a paved floor nearly paralysed with fright i glanced at the huge rusty lock and at the alien cryptic hieroglyphs graven upon it they were signs i could not recognise and something in their vaguely mongoloid technique hinted at a blasphemous and indescribable antiquity at times i fancied i could see them glowing with a greenish lighti turned to flee but found that vision of the titan paws before methe great talons seeming to swell and become more tangible as i gazed out of the cellars evil blackness they stretched with shadowy hints of scaly wrists beyond them and with a waxing malignant will guiding their horrible gropings then i heard from behind mewithin that abominable vaulta fresh burst of muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder impelled by this greater fear i advanced toward the shadowy paws with my flashlight and saw them vanish before the full force of the electric beam then up the ladder i raced torch between my teeth nor did i rest till i had regained my upstairs campwhat is to be my ultimate end i dare not imagine i came as a seeker but now i know that something is seeking me i could not leave if i wished this morning i tried to go to the gate for my supplies but found the briers twisted tightly in my path it was the same in every directionbehind and on all sides of the house in places the brown barbed vines had uncurled to astonishing heightsforming a steellike hedge against my egress the villagers are connected with all this when i went indoors i found my supplies in the great front hall though without any clue to how they came there i am sorry now that i swept the dust away i shall scatter some more and see what prints are leftthis afternoon i read some of the books in the great shadowy library at the rear of the ground floor and formed certain suspicions which i cannot bear to mention i had never seen the text of pnakotic manuscripts or of the eltdown shards before and would not have come here had i known what they contain i believe it is too late nowfor the awful sabbat is only ten days away it is for that night of horror thattheyare saving meapril 21i have been studying the portraits again some have names attached and i noticed oneof an evilfaced woman painted some two centuries agowhich puzzled me it bore the name of trintje van der heyl sleght and i have a distinct impression that i once met the name of sleght before in some significant connexion it was not horrible then though it becomes so now i must rack my brain for the cluetheeyesof these pictures haunt me is it possible that some of them are emerging more distinctly from their shrouds of dust and decay and mould the serpentfaced and swinefaced warlocks stare horribly at me from their blackened frames and a score of other hybrid faces are beginning to peer out of shadowy backgrounds there is a hideous look of family resemblance in them alland that which is human is more horrible than that which is nonhuman i wish they reminded me less of other facesfaces i have known in the past they were an accursed line and cornelis of leyden was the worst of them it washewho broke down the barrier after his father had found that other key i am sure that v knows only a fragment of the horrible truth so that i am indeed unprepared and defenceless what of the line before old claes what he did in 1591 could never have been done without generations of evil heritage or some link with the outside and what of the branches this monstrous line has sent forth are they scattered over the world all awaiting their common heritage of horror i must recall the place where i once so particularly noticed the name of sleghti wish i could be sure that these pictures stay always in their frames for several hours now i have been seeing momentary presences like the earlier paws and shadowfaces and forms but closely duplicating some of the ancient portraits somehow i can never glimpse a presence and the portrait it resembles at the same timethe light is always wrong for one or the other or else the presence and the portrait are in different roomsperhaps as i have hoped the presences are mere figments of imagination but i cannot be sure now some are female and of the same hellish beauty as the picture in the little locked room some are like no portrait i have seen yet make me feel that their painted features lurk unrecognised beneath the mould and soot of canvases i cannot decipher a few i desperately fear have approached materialisation in solid or semisolid formand some have a dreadful and unexplained familiaritythere is one woman who in fell loveliness excels all the rest her poisonous charms are like a honeyed flower growing on the brink of hell when i look at her closely she vanishes only to reappear later her face has a greenish cast and now and then i fancy i can spy a suspicion of the squamose in its smooth texture who is she is she that being who must have dwelt in the little locked room a century and more agomy supplies were again left in the front hallthat clearly is to be the custom i had sprinkled dust about to catch footprints but this morning the whole hall was swept clean by some unknown agencyapril 22this has been a day of horrible discovery i explored the cobwebbed attic again and found a carved crumbling chestplainly from hollandfull of blasphemous books and papers far older than any hitherto encountered here there was a greeknecronomicona normanfrenchlivre deibonand a first edition of old ludvig prinnsde vermis mysteriisbut the old bound manuscript was the worst it was in low latin and full of the strange crabbed handwriting of claes van der heylbeing evidently the diary or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580 when i unfastened the blackened silver clasp and opened the yellowed leaves a coloured drawing fluttered outthe likeness of a monstrous creature resembling nothing so much as a squid beaked and tentacled with great yellow eyes and with certain abominable approximations to the human form in its contoursi had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form on the paws feet and headtentacles were curious clawsreminding me of the colossal shadowshapes which have groped so horribly in my pathwhile the entity as a whole sat upon a great thronelike pedestal inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely chinese cast about both writing and image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and pervasive that i could not think it the product of any one world or age rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the evil in unbounded space throughout the aeons past and to comeand those eldritch symbols be vile sentient eikons endowed with a morbid life of their own and ready to wrest themselves from the parchment for the readers destruction to the meaning of that monster and of those hieroglyphs i had no clue but i knew that both had been traced with a hellish precision and for no namable purpose as i studied the leering characters their kinship to the symbols on that ominous lock in the cellar became more and more manifest i left the picture in the attic for never could sleep come to me with such a thing nearbyall the afternoon and evening i read in the manuscript book of old claes van der heyl and what i read will cloud and make horrible whatever period of life lies ahead of me the genesis of the world and of previous worlds unfolded itself before my eyes i learned of the city shamballah built by the lemurians fifty million years ago yet inviolate still behind its walls of psychic force in the eastern desert i learned of the book of dzyan whose first six chapters antedate the earth and which was old when the lords of venus came through space in their ships to civilise our planet and i saw recorded in writing for the first time that name which others had spoken to me in whispers and which i had known in a closer and more horrible waythe shunned and dreaded name ofyianhoin several places i was held up by passages requiring a key eventually from various allusions i gathered that old claes had not dared to embody all his knowledge in one book but had left certain points for another neither volume can be wholly intelligible without its fellow hence i have resolved to find the second one if it lies anywhere within this accursed house though plainly a prisoner i have not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown and am determined to probe the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comesapril 23searched all the morning for the second diary and found it about noon in a desk in the little locked room like the first it is in claes van der heyls barbarous latin and it seems to consist of disjointed notes referring to various sections of the other glancing through the leaves i spied at once the abhorred name of yianhoof yianho that lost and hidden city wherein brood aeonold secrets and of which dim memories older than the body lurk behind the minds of all men it was repeated many times and the text around it was strown with crudely drawn hieroglyphs plainly akin to those on the pedestal in that hellish drawing i had seen here clearly lay the key to that monstrous tentacled shape and its forbidden message with this knowledge i ascended the creaking stairs to the attic of cobwebs and horrorwhen i tried to open the attic door it stuck as never before several times it resisted every effort to open it and when at last it gave way i had a distinct feeling that some colossal unseen shape had suddenly released ita shape that soared away on nonmaterial but audibly beating wings when i found the horrible drawing i felt that it was not precisely where i had left it applying the key in the other book i soon saw that the latter was no instant guide to the secret it was only a cluea clue to a secret too black to be left lightly guarded it would take hoursperhaps daysto extract the awful messageshall i live long enough to learn the secret the shadowy black arms and paws haunt my vision more and more now and seem even more titanic than at first nor am i ever long free from those vague unhuman presences whose nebulous bulk seems too vast for the chambers to contain and now and then the grotesque evanescent faces and forms and the mocking portraitshapes troop before me in bewildering confusiontruly there are terrible primal arcana of earth which had better be left unknown and unevoked dread secrets which have nothing to do with man and which man may learn only in exchange for peace and sanity cryptic truths which make the knower evermore an alien among his kind and cause him to walk alone on earth likewise are there dread survivals of things older and more potent than man things that have blasphemously straggled down through the aeons to ages never meant for them monstrous entities that have lain sleeping endlessly in incredible crypts and remote caverns outside the laws of reason and causation and ready to be waked by such blasphemers as shall know their dark forbidden signs and furtive passwordsapril 24studied the picture and the key all day in the attic at sunset i heard strange sounds of a sort not encountered before and seeming to come from far away listening i realised that they must flow from that queer abrupt hill with the circle of standing stones which lies behind the village and some distance north of the house i had heard that there was a path from the house leading up that hill to the primal cromlech and had suspected that at certain seasons the van der heyls had much occasion to use it but the whole matter had hitherto lain latent in my consciousness the present sounds consisted of a shrill piping intermingled with a peculiar and hideous sort of hissing or whistlinga bizarre alien kind of music like nothing which the annals of earth describe it was very faint and soon faded but the matter has set me thinking it is toward the hill that the long northerly ell with the secret chute and the locked brick vault under it extend can there be any connexion which has so far eluded meapril 25i have made a peculiar and disturbing discovery about the nature of my imprisonment drawn toward the hill by a sinister fascination i found the briers giving way before mebut in that direction onlythere is a ruined gate and beneath the bushes the traces of the old path no doubt exist the briers extend part way up and all around the hill though the summit with the standing stones bears only a curious growth of moss and stunted grass i climbed the hill and spent several hours there noticing a strange wind which seems always to sweep around the forbidding monoliths and which sometimes seems to whisper in an oddly articulate though darkly cryptic fashionthese stones both in colour and in texture resemble nothing i have seen elsewhere they are neither brown nor grey but rather of a dirty yellow merging into an evil green and having a suggestion of chameleonlike variability their texture is queerly like that of a scaled serpent and is inexplicably nauseous to the touchbeing as cold and clammy as the skin of a toad or other reptile near the central menhir is a singular stonerimmed hollow which i cannot explain but which may possibly form the entrance to a longchoked well or tunnel when i sought to descend the hill at points away from the house i found the briers intercepting me as before though the path toward the house was easily retraceableapril 26up on the hill again this evening and found that windy whispering much more distinct the almost angry humming came close to actual speechof a vague sibilant sortand reminded me of the strange piping chant i had heard from afar after sunset there came a curious flash of premature summer lightning on the northern horizon followed almost at once by a queer detonation high in the fading sky something about this phenomenon disturbed me greatly and i could not escape the impression that the noise ended in a kind of unhuman hissing speech which trailed off into guttural cosmic laughter is my mind tottering at last or has my unwarranted curiosity evoked unheardof horrors from the twilight spaces the sabbat is close at hand now what will be the endapril 27at last my dreams are to be realised whether or not my life or spirit or body will be claimed i shall enter the gateway progress in deciphering those crucial hieroglyphs in the picture has been slow but this afternoon i hit upon the final clue by evening i knew their meaningand that meaning can apply in only one way to the things i have encountered in this housethere is beneath this housesepulchred i know not wherean ancient forgotten one who will shew me the gateway i would enter and give me the lost signs and words i shall need how long it has lain buried hereforgotten save by those who reared the stones on the hill and by those who later sought out this place and built this housei cannot conjecture it was in search of this thing beyond question that hendrik van der heyl came to newnetherland in 1638 men of this earth know it not save in the secret whispers of the fearshaken few who have found or inherited the key no human eye has even yet glimpsed itunless perhaps the vanished wizards of this house delved farther than has been guessedwith knowledge of the symbols came likewise a mastery of the seven lost signs of terrorand a tacit recognition of the hideous and unutterable words of fear all that remains for me to accomplish is the chant which will transfigure that forgotten one who is guardian of the ancient gateway i marvel much at the chant it is composed of strange and repellent gutturals and disturbing sibilants resembling no language i have ever encounteredeven in the blackest chapters of thelivre deibonwhen i visited the hill at sunset i tried to read it aloud but evoked in response only a vague sinister rumbling on the far horizon and a thin cloud of elemental dust that writhed and whirled like some evil living thing perhaps i do not pronounce the alien syllables correctly or perhaps it is only on the sabbatthat hellish sabbat for which the powers in this house are without question holding methat the great transfiguration can occurhad an odd spell of fright this morning i thought for a moment that i recalled where i had seen that baffling name of sleght before and the prospect of realisation filled me with unutterable horrorapril 28today dark ominous clouds have hovered intermittently over the circle on the hill i have noticed such clouds several times before but their contours and arrangements now hold a fresh significance they are snakelike and fantastic and curiously like the evil shadowshapes i have seen in the house they float in a circle around the primal cromlechrevolving repeatedly as though endowed with a sinister life and purpose i could swear too that they give forth an angry murmuring after some fifteen minutes they sail slowly away ever to the eastward like the units of a straggling battalion are they indeed those dread ones whom solomon knew of oldthose giant black beings whose number is legion and whose tread doth shake the earthi have been rehearsing the chant that will transfigure the nameless thing yet strange fears assail me even when i utter the syllables under my breath piecing all evidence together i have now discovered that the only way to it is through the locked cellar vault that vault was built with a hellish purpose and must cover the hidden burrow leading to the immemorial lair what guardians live endlessly within flourishing from century to century on an unknown nourishment only the mad may conjecture the warlocks of this house who called them out of inner earth have known them only too well as the shocking portraits and memories of the place revealwhat troubles me most is the limited nature of the chant it evokes the nameless one yet provides no method for the control of that which is evoked there are of course the general signs and gestures but whether they will prove effective toward such an one remains to be seen still the rewards are great enough to justify any dangerand i could not retreat if i would since an unknown force plainly urges me oni have discovered one more obstacle since the locked cellar vault must be traversed the key to that place must be found the lock is infinitely too strong for forcing that the key is somewhere hereabouts cannot be doubted but the time before the sabbat is very short i must search diligently and thoroughly it will take courage to unlock that iron door for what prisoned horrors may not lurk withinlateri have been shunning the cellar for the past day or two but late this afternoon i again descended to those forbidding precincts at first all was silent but within five minutes the menacing padding and muttering began once more beyond the iron door this time it was loud and more terrifying than on any previous occasion and i likewise recognised the slithering that bespoke some monstrous seabeastnow swifter and nervously intensified as if the thing were striving to force its way through the portal to where i stoodas the pacing grew louder more restless and more sinister there began to pound through it those hellish and unidentifiable reverberations which i had heard on my second visit to the cellarthose muffled reverberations which seemed to echo from far horizons like distant thunder now however their volume was magnified an hundredfold and their timbre freighted with new and terrifying implications i can compare the sound to nothing more aptly than to the roar of some dread monster of the vanished saurian age when primal horrors roamed the earth and valusias serpentmen laid the foundationstones of evil magic to such a roarbut swelled to deafening heights reached by no known organic throatwas this shocking sound akin dare i unlock the door and face the onslaught of what lies beyondapril 29the key to the vault is found i came upon it this noon in the little locked roomburied beneath rubbish in a drawer of the ancient desk as if some belated effort to conceal it had been made it was wrapped in a crumbling newspaper dated oct 31 1872 but there was an inner wrapping of dried skinevidently the hide of some unknown reptilewhich bore a low latin message in the same crabbed writing as that of the notebooks i found as i had thought the lock and key were vastly older than the vault old claes van der heyl had them ready for something he or his descendants meant to doand how much older than he they were i could not estimate deciphering the latin message i trembled in a fresh access of clutching terror and nameless awethe secrets of the monstrous primal ones ran the crabbed text whose cryptic words relate the hidden things that were before man the things no one of earth should learn lest peace be forever forfeited shall by me never suffer revelation to yianho that lost and forbidden city of countless aeons whose place may not be told i have been in the veritable flesh of this body as none other among the living has been therein have i found and thence have i borne away that knowledge which i would gladly lose though i may not i have learnt to bridge a gap that should not be bridged and must call out of the earth that which should not be waked or called and what is sent to follow me will not sleep till i or those after me have found and done what is to be found and donethat which i have awaked and borne away with me i may not part with again so is it written in the book of hidden things that which i have willed to be has twined its dreadful shape around me andif i live not to do the biddingaround those children born and unborn who shall come after me until the bidding be done strange may be their joinings and awful the aid they may summon till the end be reached into lands unknown and dim must the seeking go and a house must be built for the outer guardiansthis is the key to that lock which was given me in the dreadful aeonold and forbidden city of yianho the lock which i or mine must place upon the vestibule of that which is to be found and may the lords of yaddith succour meor himwho must set that lock in place or turn the key thereofsuch was the messagea message which once i had read it i seemed to have known before now as i write these words the key is before me i gaze on it with mixed dread and longing and cannot find words to describe its aspect it is of the same unknown subtly greenish frosted metal as the lock a metal best compared to brass tarnished with verdigris its design is alien and fantastic and the coffinshaped end of the ponderous bulk leaves no doubt of the lock it was meant to fit the handle roughly forms a strange nonhuman image whose exact outlines and identity cannot now be traced upon holding it for any length of time i seem to feel an alien anomalouslifein the cold metala quickening or pulsing too feeble for ordinary recognition below the eidolon is graven a faint aeonworn legend in those blasphemous chineselike hieroglyphs i have come to know so well i can make out only the beginningthe words my vengeance lurksbefore the text fades to indistinctness there is some fatality in this timely finding of the keyfor tomorrow night comes the hellish sabbatbut strangely enough amidst all this hideous expectancy that question of the sleght name bothers me more and more why should i dread to find it linked with the van der heylswalpurgiseveapril 30the time has come i waked last night to see the sky glowing with a lurid greenish radiancethat same morbid green which i have seen in the eyes and skin of certain portraits here on the shocking lock and key on the monstrous menhirs of the hill and in a thousand other recesses of my consciousness there were strident whispers in the airsibilant whistlings like those of the wind around that dreadful cromlech something spoke to me out of the frore aether of space and it said the hour falls it is an omen and i laugh at my own fears have i not the dread words and the seven lost signs of terrorthe power coercive of any dweller in the cosmos or in the unknown darkened spaces i will no longer hesitatethe heavens are very dark as if a terrific storm were coming ona storm even greater than that of the night when i reached here nearly a fortnight ago from the villageless than a mile awayi hear a queer and unwonted babbling it is as i thoughtthese poor degraded idiots are within the secret and keep the awful sabbat on the hill here in the house the shadows gather densely in the darkness the key before me almost glows with a greenish light of its own i have not yet been to the cellar it is better that i wait lest the sound of that muttering and paddingthose slitherings and muffled reverberationsunnerve me before i can unlock the fateful doorof what i shall encounter and what i must do i have only the mostgeneralidea shall i find my task in the vault itself or must i burrow deeper into the nighted heart of our planet there are things i do not yet understandor at least prefer not to understanddespite a dreadful increasing and inexplicable sense of bygone familiarity with this fearsome house that chute for instance leading down from the little locked room but i think i know why the wing with the vault extends toward the hill6 pmlooking out the north windows i can see a group of villagers on the hill they seem unaware of the lowering sky and are digging near the great central menhir it occurs to me that they are working on that stonerimmed hollow place which looks like a longchoked tunnel entrance what is to come how much of the olden sabbat rites have these people retained that key glows horriblyit is not

i awoke abruptly from a horrible dream and stared wildly about then seeing the high arched ceiling and the narrow stained windows of my friends room a flood of uneasy revelation coursed over me and i knew that all of andrews hopes had been realized i lay supine in a large bed the posts of which reared upward in dizzy perspective while on vast shelves about the chamber were the familiar books and antiques i was accustomed to seeing in that secluded corner of the crumbling and ancient mansion which had formed our joint home for many years on a table by the wall stood a huge candelabrum of early workmanship and design and the usual light windowcurtains had been replaced by hangings of somber black which took on a faint ghostly luster in the dying lighti recalled forcibly the events preceding my confinement and seclusion in this veritable medieval fortress they were not pleasant and i shuddered anew when i remembered the couch that had held me before my tenancy of the present onethe couch that everyone supposed would be my last memory burned afresh regarding those hideous circumstances which had compelled me to choose between a true death and a hypothetical onewith a later reanimation by therapeutic methods known only to my comrade marshall andrews the whole thing had begun when i returned from the orient a year before and discovered to my utter horror that i had contracted leprosy while abroad i had known that i was taking grave chances in caring for my stricken brother in the philippines but no hint of my own affliction appeared until i returned to my native land andrews himself had made the discovery and kept it from me as long as possible but our close acquaintance soon disclosed the awful truthat once i was quartered in our ancient abode atop the crags overlooking crumbling hampden from whose musty halls and quaint arched doorways i was never permitted to go forth it was a terrible existence with the yellow shadow hanging constantly over me yet my friend never faltered in his faith taking care not to contract the dread scourge but meanwhile making life as pleasant and comfortable as possible his widespread though somewhat sinister fame as a surgeon prevented any authority from discovering my plight and shipping me awayit was after nearly a year of this seclusionlate in augustthat andrews decided on a trip to the west indiesto study native medical methods he said i was left in care of venerable simes the household factotum so far no outward signs of the disease had developed and i enjoyed a tolerable though almost completely private existence during my colleagues absence it was during this time that i read many of the tomes andrews had acquired in the course of his twenty years as a surgeon and learned why his reputation though locally of the highest was just a bit shady for the volumes included any number of fanciful subjects hardly related to modern medical knowledge treatises and unauthoritative articles on monstrous experiments in surgery accounts of the bizarre effects of glandular transplantation and rejuvenation in animals and men alike brochures on attempted brain transference and a host of other fanatical speculations not countenanced by orthodox physicians it appeared too that andrews was an authority on obscure medicaments some of the few books i waded through revealing that he had spent much time in chemistry and in the search for new drugs which might be used as aids in surgery looking back at those studies now i find them hellishly suggestive when associated with his later experimentsandrews was gone longer than i expected returning early in november almost four months later and when he did arrive i was quite anxious to see him since my condition was at last on the brink of becoming noticeable i had reached a point where i must seek absolute privacy to keep from being discovered but my anxiety was slight as compared with his exuberance over a certain new plan he had hatched while in the indiesa plan to be carried out with the aid of a curious drug he had learned of from a native doctor in haiti when he explained that his idea concerned me i became somewhat alarmed though in my position there could be little to make my plight worse i had indeed considered more than once the oblivion that would come with a revolver or a plunge from the roof to the jagged rocks belowon the day after his arrival in the seclusion of the dimly lit study he outlined the whole grisly scheme he had found in haiti a drug the formula for which he would develop later which induced a state of profound sleep in anyone taking it a trance so deep that death was closely counterfeitedwith all muscular reflexes even the respiration and heartbeat completely stilled for the time being andrews had he said seen it demonstrated on natives many times some of them remained somnolent for days at a time wholly immobile and as much like death as death itself this suspended animation he explained further would even pass the closest examination of any medical man he himself according to all known laws would have to report as dead a man under the influence of such a drug he stated too that the subjects body assumed the precise appearance of a corpseeven a slightrigor mortisdeveloping in prolonged casesfor some time his purpose did not seem wholly clear but when the full import of his words became apparent i felt weak and nauseated yet in another way i was relieved for the thing meant at least a partial escape from my curse an escape from the banishment and shame of an ordinary death of the dread leprosy briefly his plan was to administer a strong dose of the drug to me and call the local authorities who would immediately pronounce me dead and see that i was buried within a very short while he felt assured that with their careless examination they would fail to notice my leprosy symptoms which in truth had hardly appeared only a trifle over fifteen months had passed since i had caught the disease whereas the corruption takes seven years to run its entire courselater he said would come resurrection after my interment in the family graveyardbeside my centuried dwelling and barely a quartermile from his own ancient pilethe appropriate steps would be taken finally when my estate was settled and my decease widely known he would secretly open the tomb and bring me to his own abode again still alive and none the worse for my adventure it seemed a ghastly and daring plan but to me it offered the only hope for even a partial freedom so i accepted his proposition but not without a myriad of misgivings what if the effect of the drug should wear off while i was in my tomb what if the coroner should discover the awful ruse and fail to inter me these were some of the hideous doubts which assailed me before the experiment though death would have been a release from my curse i feared it even worse than the yellow scourge feared it even when i could see its black wings constantly hovering over mefortunately i was spared the horror of viewing my own funeral and burial rites they must however have gone just as andrews had planned even to the subsequent disinterment for after the initial dose of the poison from haiti i lapsed into a semiparalytic state and from that to a profound nightblack sleep the drug had been administered in my room and andrews had told me before giving it that he would recommend to the coroner a verdict of heart failure due to nerve strain of course there was no embalmingandrews saw to thatand the whole procedure leading up to my secret transportation from the graveyard to his crumbling manor covered a period of three days having been buried late in the afternoon of the third day my body was secured by andrews that very night he had replaced the fresh sod just as it had been when the workmen left old simes sworn to secrecy had helped andrews in his ghoulish tasklater i had lain for over a week in my old familiar bed owing to some unexpected effect of the drug my whole body was completely paralyzed so that i could move my head only slightly all my senses however were fully alert and by another weeks time i was able to take nourishment in good quantities andrews explained that my body would gradually regain its former sensibilities though owing to the presence of the leprosy it might take considerable time he seemed greatly interested in analyzing my daily symptoms and always asked if there was any feeling present in my bodymany days passed before i was able to control any part of my anatomy and much longer before the paralysis crept from my enfeebled limbs so that i could feel the ordinary bodily reactions lying and staring at my numb hulk was like having it injected with a perpetual anesthetic there was a total alienation i could not understand considering that my head and neck were quite alive and in good healthandrews explained that he had revived my upper half first and could not account for the complete bodily paralysis though my condition seemed to trouble him little considering the damnably intent interest he centered upon my reactions and stimuli from the very beginning many times during lulls in our conversation i would catch a strange gleam in his eyes as he viewed me on the coucha glint of victorious exultation which queerly enough he never voiced aloud though he seemed to be quite glad that i had run the gauntlet of death and had come through alive still there was that horror i was to meet in less than six years which added to my desolation and melancholy during the tedious days in which i awaited the return of normal bodily functions but i would be up and about he assured me before very long enjoying an existence few men had ever experienced the words did not however impress me with their true and ghastly meaning until many days laterduring that awful siege in bed andrews and i became somewhat estranged he no longer treated me so much like a friend as like an implement in his skilled and greedy fingers i found him possessed of unexpected traitslittle examples of baseness and cruelty apparent even to the hardened simes which disturbed me in a most unusual manner often he would display extraordinary cruelty to live specimens in his laboratory for he was constantly carrying on various hidden projects in glandular and muscular transplantation on guineapigs and rabbits he had also been employing his newly discovered sleepingpotion in curious experiments with suspended animation but of these things he told me very little though old simes often let slip chance comments which shed some light on the proceedings i was not certain how much the old servant knew but he had surely learned considerable being a constant companion to both andrews and myselfwith the passage of time a slow but consistent feeling began creeping into my disabled body and at the reviving symptoms andrews took a fanatical interest in my case he still seemed more coldly analytical than sympathetic toward me taking my pulse and heartbeat with more than usual zeal occasionally in his fevered examinations i saw his hands tremble slightlyan uncommon sight with so skilled a surgeonbut he seemed oblivious of my scrutiny i was never allowed even a momentary glimpse of my full body but with the feeble return of the sense of touch i was aware of a bulk and heaviness which at first seemed awkward and unfamiliargradually i regained the use of my hands and arms and with the passing of the paralysis came a new and terrible sensation of physical estrangement my limbs had difficulty in following the commands of my mind and every movement was jerky and uncertain so clumsy were my hands that i had to become accustomed to them all over again this must i thought be due to my disease and the advance of the contagion in my system being unaware of how the early symptoms affected the victim my brothers being a more advanced case i had no means of judging and since andrews shunned the subject i deemed it better to remain silentone day i asked andrewsi no longer considered him a friendif i might try rising and sitting up in bed at first he objected strenuously but later after cautioning me to keep the blankets well up around my chin so that i would not be chilled he permitted it this seemed strange in view of the comfortable temperature now that late autumn was slowly turning into winter the room was always well heated a growing chilliness at night and occasional glimpses of a leaden sky through the window had told me of the changing season for no calendar was ever in sight upon the dingy walls with the gentle help of simes i was eased to a sitting position andrews coldly watching from the door to the laboratory at my success a slow smile spread across his leering features and he turned to disappear from the darkened doorway his mood did nothing to improve my condition old simes usually so regular and consistent was now often late in his duties sometimes leaving me alone for hours at a timethe terrible sense of alienation was heightened by my new position it seemed that the legs and arms inside my gown were hardly able to follow the summoning of my mind and it became mentally exhausting to continue movement for any length of time my fingers woefully clumsy were wholly unfamiliar to my inner sense of touch and i wondered vaguely if i were to be accursed the rest of my days with an awkwardness induced by my dread maladyit was on the evening following my halfrecovery that the dreams began i was tormented not only at night but during the day as well i would awaken screaming horribly from some frightful nightmare i dared not think about outside the realm of sleep these dreams consisted mainly of ghoulish things graveyards at night stalking corpses and lost souls amid a chaos of blinding light and shadow the terriblerealityof the visions disturbed me most of all it seemed that someinsideinfluence was inducing the grisly vistas of moonlit tombstones and endless catacombs of the restless dead i could not place their source and at the end of a week i was quite frantic with abominable thoughts which seemed to obtrude themselves upon my unwelcome consciousnessby that time a slow plan was forming whereby i might escape the living hell into which i had been propelled andrews cared less and less about me seeming intent only on my progress and growth and recovery of normal muscular reactions i was becoming every day more convinced of the nefarious doings going on in that laboratory across the thresholdthe animal cries were shocking and rasped hideously on my overwrought nerves and i was gradually beginning to think that andrews had not saved me from deportation solely for my own benefit but for some accursed reason of his own simess attention was slowly becoming slighter and slighter and i was convinced that the aged servitor had a hand in the deviltry somewhere andrews no longer eyed me as a friend but as an object of experimentation nor did i like the way he fingered his scalpel when he stood in the narrow doorway and stared at me with crafty alertness i had never before seen such a transformation come over any man his ordinarily handsome features were now lined and whiskergrown and his eyes gleamed as if some imp of satan were staring from them his cold calculating gaze made me shudder horribly and gave me a fresh determination to free myself from his bondage as soon as possiblei had lost track of time during my dreamorgy and had no way of knowing how fast the days were passing the curtains were often drawn in the daytime the room being lit by waxen cylinders in the large candelabrum it was a nightmare of living horror and unreality though through it all i was gradually becoming stronger i always gave careful responses to andrews inquiries concerning my returning physical control concealing the fact that a new life was vibrating through me with every passing dayan altogether strange sort of strength but one which i was counting on to serve me in the coming crisisfinally one chilly evening when the candles had been extinguished and a pale shaft of moonlight fell through the dark curtains upon my bed i determined to rise and carry out my plan of action there had been no movement from either of my captors for several hours and i was confident that both were asleep in adjoining bedchambers shifting my cumbersome weight carefully i rose to a sitting position and crawled cautiously out of bed down upon the floor a vertigo gripped me momentarily and a wave of weakness flooded my entire being but finally strength returned and by clutching at a bedpost i was able to stand upon my feet for the first time in many months gradually a new strength coursed through me and i donned the dark robe which i had seen hanging on a nearby chair it was quite long but served as a cloak over my nightdress again came that feeling of awful unfamiliarity which i had experienced in bed that sense of alienation and of difficulty in making my limbs perform as they should but there was need for haste before my feeble strength might give out as a last precaution in dressing i slipped some old shoes over my feet but though i could have sworn they were my own they seemed abnormally loose so that i decided they must belong to the aged simesseeing no other heavy objects in the room i seized from the table the huge candelabrum upon which the moon shone with a pallid glow and proceeded very quietly toward the laboratory doormy first steps came jerkily and with much difficulty and in the semidarkness i was unable to make my way very rapidly when i reached the threshold a glance within revealed my former friend seated in a large overstuffed chair while beside him was a smokingstand upon which were assorted bottles and a glass he reclined halfway in the moonlight through the large window and his greasy features were creased in a drunken smirk an opened book lay in his lapone of the hideous tomes from his private libraryfor a long moment i gloated over the prospect before me and then stepping forward suddenly i brought the heavy weapon down upon his unprotected head the dull crunch was followed by a spurt of blood and the fiend crumpled to the floor his head laid half open i felt no contrition at taking the mans life in such a manner in the hideous halfvisible specimens of his surgical wizardry scattered about the room in various stages of completion and preservation i felt there was enough evidence to blast his soul without my aid andrews had gone too far in his practices to continue living and as one of his monstrous specimensof that i was now hideously certainit was my duty to exterminate himsimes i realized would be no such easy matter indeed only unusual good fortune had caused me to find andrews unconscious when i finally reeled up to the servants bedchamber door faint from exhaustion i knew it would take all my remaining strength to complete the ordealthe old mans room was in utmost darkness being on the north side of the structure but he must have seen me silhouetted in the doorway as i came in he screamed hoarsely and i aimed the candelabrum at him from the threshold it struck something soft making a sloughing sound in the darkness but the screaming continued from that time on events became hazy and jumbled together but i remember grappling with the man and choking the life from him little by little he gibbered a host of awful things before i could lay hands on himcried and begged for mercy from my clutching fingers i hardly realized my own strength in that mad moment which left andrews associate in a condition like his ownretreating from the darkened chamber i stumbled for the stairway door sagged through it and somehow reached the landing below no lamps were burning and my only light was a filtering of moonbeams coming from the narrow windows in the hall but i made my jerky way over the cold damp slabs of stone reeling from the terrible weakness of my exertion and reached the front door after ages of fumbling and crawling about in the darknessvague memories and haunting shadows came to taunt me in that ancient hallway shadows once friendly and understandable but now grown alien and unrecognizable so that i stumbled down the worn steps in a frenzy of something more than fear for a moment i stood in the shadow of the giant stone manor viewing the moonlit trail down which i must go to reach the home of my forefathers only a quarter of a mile distant but the way seemed long and for a while i despaired of ever traversing the whole of itat last i grasped a piece of dead wood as a cane and set out down the winding road ahead seemingly only a few rods away in the moonlight stood the venerable mansion where my ancestors had lived and died its turrets rose spectrally in the shimmering radiance and the black shadow cast on the beetling hillside appeared to shift and waver as if belonging to a castle of unreal substance there stood the monument of half a century a haven for all my family old and young which i had deserted many years ago to live with the fanatical andrews it stood empty on that fateful night and i hope that it may always remain soin some manner i reached the aged place though i do not remember the last half of the journey at all it was enough to be near the family cemetery among whose mosscovered and crumbling stones i would seek the oblivion i had desired as i approached the moonlit spot the old familiarityso absent during my abnormal existencereturned to plague me in a wholly unexpected way i drew close to my own tombstone and the feeling of homecoming grew stronger with it came a fresh flood of that awful sense of alienation and disembodiment which i knew so well i was satisfied that the end was drawing near nor did i stop to analyze emotions till a little later when the full horror of my position burst upon meintuitively i knew my own tombstone for the grass had scarcely begun to grow between the pieces of sod with feverish haste i began clawing at the mound and scraping the wet earth from the hole left by the removal of the grass and roots how long i worked in the nitrous soil before my fingers struck the coffinlid i can never say but sweat was pouring from me and my nails were but useless bleeding hooksat last i threw out the last bit of loose earth and with trembling fingers tugged on the heavy lid it gave a trifle and i was prepared to lift it completely open when a fetid and nauseous odor assailed my nostrils i started erect horrified had some idiot placed my tombstone on the wrong grave causing me to unearth another body for surely there could be no mistaking that awful stench gradually a hideous uncertainty came over me and i scrambled from the hole one look at the newly made headpiece was enough this was indeed my own grave but what fool had buried within it another corpseall at once a bit of the unspeakable truth propelled itself upon my brain the odor in spite of its putrescence seemed somehow familiarhorriblyfamiliar yet i could not credit my senses with such an idea reeling and cursing i fell into the black cavity once more and by the aid of a hastily lit match lifted the long lid completely open then the light went out as if extinguished by a malignant hand and i clawed my way out of that accursed pit screaming in a frenzy of fear and loathingwhen i regained consciousness i was lying before the door of my own ancient manor where i must have crawled after that hideous rendezvous in the family cemetery i realized that dawn was close at hand and rose feebly opening the aged portal before me and entering the place which had known no footsteps for over a decade a fever was ravaging my weakened body so that i was hardly able to stand but i made my way slowly through the musty dimly lit chambers and staggered into my own studythe study i had deserted so many years beforewhen the sun has risen i shall go to the ancient well beneath the old willow tree by the cemetery and cast my deformedselfinto it no other man shall ever view this blasphemy which has survived life longer than it should have i do not know what people will say when they see my disordered grave but this will not trouble me if i can find oblivion from that which i beheld amidst the crumbling mosscrusted stones of the hideous placei know now why andrews was so secretive in his actions so damnably gloating in his attitude toward me after my artificial death he had meant me for a specimen all the timea specimen of his greatest feat of surgery his masterpiece of unclean witchery an example of perverted artistry for him alone to see where andrews obtained thatotherwith which i lay accursed in his moldering mansion i shall probably never know but i am afraid that it was brought from haiti along with his fiendish medicine at least these long hairy arms and horrible short legs are alien to me alien to all natural and sane laws of mankind the thought that i shall be tortured with thatotherduring the rest of my brief existence is another hellnow i can but wish for that which once was mine that which every man blessed of god ought to have at death that which i saw in that awful moment in the ancient burial ground when i raised the lid on the coffinmy own shrunken decayed and headless body,1
there is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream and out of which no stream flows ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath but sarnath stands there no moreit is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar another city stood beside the lake the grey stone city of ib which was old as the lake itself and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold very odd and ugly were these beings as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned it is written on the brick cylinders of kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it that they had bulging eyes pouting flabby lips and curious ears and were without voice it is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist they and the vast still lake and grey stone city ib however this may be it is certain that they worshipped a seagreen stone idol chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the great waterlizard before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous and it is written in the papyrus of ilarnek that they one day discovered fire and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions but not much is written of these beings because they lived in very ancient times and man is young and knows little of the very ancient living thingsafter many aeons men came to the land of mnar dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks who built thraa ilarnek and kadatheron on the winding river ai and certain tribes more hardy than the rest pushed on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earthnot far from the grey city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath and at the beings of ib they marvelled greatly but with their marvelling was mixed hate for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the grey monoliths of ib for those sculptures were terrible with great antiquity why the beings and the sculptures lingered so late in the world even until the coming of men none can tell unless it was because the land of mnar is very still and remote from most other lands both of waking and of dreamas the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew and it was not less because they found the beings weak and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and spears and arrows so one day the young warriors the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen marched against ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears because they did not wish to touch them and because they did not like the grey sculptured monoliths of ib they cast these also into the lake wondering from the greatness of the labour how ever the stones were brought from afar as they must have been since there is naught like them in all the land of mnar or in the lands adjacentthus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared save the seagreen stone idol chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the waterlizard this the young warriors took back with them to sarnath as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of ib and a sign of leadership in mnar but on the night after it was set up in the temple a terrible thing must have happened for weird lights were seen over the lake and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the highpriest taranish lying dead as from some fear unspeakable and before he died taranish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of doomafter taranish there were many highpriests in sarnath but never was the seagreen stone idol found and many centuries came and went wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly so that only priests and old women remembered what taranish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan route and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river ai and beyond so sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighbouring cities and in time there sate upon a throne in sarnath the kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacentthe wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the magnificent of polished desertquarried marble were its walls in height 300 cubits and in breadth 75 so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top for full 500 stadia did they run being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone seawall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib in sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans and fifty more intersecting them with onyx were they paved save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod which were paved with granite and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets each of bronze and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men the houses of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet with strange art were they builded for no other city had houses like them and travellers from thraa and ilarnek and kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmountedbut more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples and the gardens made by zokkar the olden king there were many palaces the least of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder many were the pillars of the palaces all of tinted marble and carven into designs of surpassing beauty and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapislazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers and there were likewise fountains which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of the lands adjacent on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne many steps above the gleaming floor and it was wrought of one piece of ivory though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come in that palace there were also many galleries and many amphitheatres where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings sometimes the amphitheatres were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts and then were enacted stirring seafights or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine thingslofty and amazing were the seventeen towerlike temples of sarnath fashioned of a bright multicoloured stone not known elsewhere a full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them wherein the highpriests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces where gathered throngs in worship of zokalar and tamash and lobon the chief gods of sarnath whose incenseenveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs not like the eikons of other gods were those of zokalar and tamash and lobon for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones and up unending steps of shining zircon was the towerchamber wherefrom the highpriests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets and their reflections in the lake by night here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug the waterlizard and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the doomscrawl of taranishwonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king in the centre of sarnath they lay covering a great space and encircled by a high wall and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass through which shone the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was clear and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear in summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans and in winter they were heated with concealed fires so that in those gardens it was always spring there ran little streams over bright pebbles dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues and spanned by a multitude of bridges many were the waterfalls in their courses and many were the lilied lakelets into which they expanded over the streams and lakelets rode white swans whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters in ordered terraces rose the green banks adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms and seats and benches of marble and porphyry and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small godseach year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying of ib at which time wine song dancing and merriment of every kind abounded great honours were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of zokkar and the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it at first the highpriests liked not these festivals for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the seagreen eikon had vanished and how taranish had died from fear and left a warning and they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake but as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters indeed had they not themselves in their high tower often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug the waterlizard and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath wonder of the world and pride of all mankindgorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of ib for a decade had it been talked of in the land of mnar and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from thraa ilarnek and kadatheron and all the cities of mnar and the lands beyond before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers within his banquethall reclined nargishei the king drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnath and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast peacocks from the isles of nariel in the middle ocean young goats from the distant hills of implan heels of camels from the bnazic desert nuts and spices from cydathrian groves and pearls from wavewashed mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa of sauces there were an untold number prepared by the subtlest cooks in all mnar and suited to the palate of every feaster but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake each of vast size and served up on golden platters set with rubies and diamondswhilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters others feasted elsewhere in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighbouring lands made merry and it was the highpriest gnaikah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water and saw that the grey rock akurion which was wont to rear high above it near the shore was almost submerged and fear grew vaguely yet swiftly so that the princes of ilarnek and of far rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed for the river ai though they scarce knew the reason for their departingthen close to the hour of midnight all the bronze gates of sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the kings banquethall where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of nargishei and his nobles and slaves but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes pouting flabby lips and curious ears things which danced horribly bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds containing uncouth flames and the princes and travellers as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and camels and elephants looked again upon the mistbegetting lake and saw the grey rock akurion was quite submergedthrough all the land of mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more it was long ere any traveller went thither and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of distant falona dared make the journey adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes who are no kin to the men of mnar these men indeed went to the lake to view sarnath but though they found the vast still lake itself and the grey rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind where once had risen walls of 300 cubits and towers yet higher now stretched only the marshy shore and where once had dwelt fifty millions of men now crawled only the detestable green waterlizard not even the mines of precious metal remained for doom had come to sarnathbut half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol of stone an exceedingly ancient idol coated with seaweed and chiselled in the likeness of bokrug the great waterlizard that idol enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of mnar,1
three times randolph carter dreamed of the marvellous city and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset with walls temples colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble silverbasined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossomladen urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles it was a fever of the gods a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain and as carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almostvanished memory the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had an awesome and momentous placehe knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it or whether in dream or in waking he could not tell vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetick to the eager sound of lutes and song unclosing faery gates toward further and surprising marvels but each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dreams tyrannous gods for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot or descend the wide marmoreal flights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoningwhen for the third time he awaked with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath in the cold waste where no man treads but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests nasht and kamanthah whose caverntemple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world it seemed however that his prayers must have been adversely heard for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights and against some hidden plan or wish of the godsat length sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown kadath veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the great onesin light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and kamanthah and the priests shook their pshentbearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul they pointed out that the great ones had shewn already their wish and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas they reminded him too that not only had no man ever been to unknown kadath but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie whether it be in the dreamlands around our world or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or aldebaran if in our dreamland it might conceivably be reached but only three fully human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands and of that three two had come back quite mad there were in such voyages incalculable local dangers as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe where no dreams reach that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinitythe boundless daemonsultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods the blind voiceless tenebrous mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotepof these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and kamanthah in the cavern of flame but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown kadath in the cold waste wherever that might be and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city he knew that his journey would be strange and long and that the great ones would be against it but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him so asking a farewell blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted woodin the tunnels of that twisted wood whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs who know many obscure secrets of the dreamworld and a few of the waking world since the wood at two places touches the lands of men though it would be disastrous to say where certain unexplained rumours events and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dream but over the nearer parts of the dreamworld they pass freely flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love most of them live in burrows but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat either physical or spiritual for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out carter however had no fear for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them having found through their help the splendid city of celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills where reigns half the year the great king kuranes a man he had known by another name in life kuranes was the one soul who had been to the stargulfs and returned free from madnessthreading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs and listened now and then for responses he remembered one particular village of the creatures near the centre of the wood where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten and toward this spot he hastened he traced his way by the grotesque fungi which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed finally the greater light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight this was the nearest of the great ring of stones and carter knew he was close to the zoog village renewing his fluttering sound he waited patiently and was at length rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him it was the zoogs for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small slippery brown outlinesout they swarmed from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree till the whole dimlitten region was alive with them some of the wilder ones brushed carter unpleasantly and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders the council of sages recognising the visitor offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon and as carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began the zoogs did not unfortunately know where the peak of kadath lies nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dreamworld or in another rumours of the great ones came equally from all points and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneaththen one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheardof by the others and said that in ulthar beyond the river skai there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame manytempled olatho and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar those manuscripts he said told much of the gods and besides in ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight he had failed though his companion had succeeded and perished namelesslyso randolph carter thanked the zoogs who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of moontree wine to take with him and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side where the rushing skai flows down from the slopes of lerion and hatheg and nir and ulthar dot the plain behind him furtive and unseen crept several of the curious zoogs for they wished to learn what might befall him and bear back the legend to their people the vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers there he would turn sharply aside for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks and what it was possibly set up for the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberatelycarter detoured at the proper place and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs he had known they would follow him so he was not disturbed for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures it was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning over fertile plains rolling down to the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind at another house where people were stirring he asked questions about the gods and whether they danced often upon lerion but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and tell him the way to nir and ultharat noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the skai into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteenhundred years before once on the other side the frequent presence of cats who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs revealed the near neighbourhood of ulthar for in ulthar according to an ancient and significant law no man may kill a cat very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimneypots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough carter the cats being somewhat dispersed by the halfseen zoogs picked his way directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and old records were said to be and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stonewhich crowns ulthars highest hillhe sought out the patriarch atal who had been up the forbidden peak hathegkla in the stony desert and had come down again aliveatal seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple was fully three centuries old but still very keen of mind and memory from him carter learned many things about the gods but mainly that they are indeed only earths gods ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere they might atal said heed a mans prayer if in good humour but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste it was lucky that no man knew where kadath towers for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave atals companion barzai the wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of hathegkla with unknown kadath if ever found matters would be much worse for although earths gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal they are protected by the other gods from outside whom it is better not to discuss at least twice in the worlds history the other gods set their seal upon earths primal granite once in antediluvian times as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic manuscripts too ancient to be read and once on hathegkla when barzai the wise tried to see earths gods dancing by moonlight so atal said it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayerscarter though disappointed by atals discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven cryptical books of hsan did not wholly despair first he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods aid but atal could tell him nothing probably atal said the place belonged to his especial dreamworld and not to the general land of vision that many know and conceivably it might be on another planet in that case earths gods could not guide him if they would but this was not likely since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the great ones wished to hide from himthen carter did a wicked thing offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moonwine which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative robbed of his reserve poor atal babbled freely of forbidden things telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek on the isle of oriab in the southern sea and hinting that it may be a likeness which earths gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain and he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange so that one might easily recognise them and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the godsnow the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to carter it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones often espouse the daughters of men so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their blood this being so the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on ngranek and mark the features then having noted them with care to search for such features among living men where they are plainest and thickest there must the gods dwell nearest and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands kadathmuch of the great ones might be learnt in such regions and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker they might not know their parentage for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly a thing which carter realised even as he sought to scale kadath but they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in dreamland that common folk would call them fools and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret and more one might in certain cases seize some wellloved child of a god as hostage or even capture some young god himself disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his brideatal however did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges down to the southern sea where no burgess of ulthar has ever been but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and twowheeled carts there is a great city there dylathleen but in ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black threebanked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore the traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human or nearly so but the rowers are never beheld and it is not thought wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibitedby the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy and carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest as he turned to go he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priests conversation he recalled too the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked their chops and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no fartherit was sunset now so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town and as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond all mellow and magical in the slanted light he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one on toward unknown perils then twilight fell and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows and sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the skai with the night came song and carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tessellated courts of simple ulthar and there might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthars many cats but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moons dark side whither the cats leap from tall housetops but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in carters lap to purr and play and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant drowsy herbsin the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for dylathleen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthars busy farms and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the skai stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmens songs came from the placid river the country was very beautiful with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmillson the seventh day a blur of smoke arose on the horizon ahead and then the tall black towers of dylathleen which is built mostly of basalt dylathleen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the giants causeway and its streets are dark and uninviting there are many dismal seataverns near the myriad wharves and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab and found that they knew of it well ships came from baharna on that island one being due to return thither in only a month and ngranek is but two days zebraride from that port but few had seen the stone face of the god because it is on a very difficult side of ngranek which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava once the gods were angered with men on that side and spoke of the matter to the other godsit was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in dylathleens seataverns because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys one of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock the mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste and their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the six kingdoms but worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded yet to give no glimpse of its crew it was not fair to the tavernkeepers of dylathleen or to the grocers and butchers either for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard the merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from parg across the river that was all they ever took those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers never anything from the butchers and grocers but only gold and the fat black men of parg whom they bought by the pound and the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old seataverns bear them dylathleen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere but no mine in all earths dreamland was known to produce their likeof these things dylathleens cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna which might bear him to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren meanwhile he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset of these things however he learned nothing though he once thought that a certain old slanteyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of this man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar he was even rumoured to have dealt with that highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery that such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted but carter soon found that it was no use questioning himthen the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt mole and the tall lighthouse silent and alien and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront and after a while the dark widemouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped stealthily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers carter observed them closely and disliked them more the longer he looked at them then he saw them drive the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley and wondered in what landsor if in any lands at allthose fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serveand on the third evening of that galleys stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of carters quest he appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling and though the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked he bade him therefore be his own guest in locked chambers above and drew out the last of the zoogs moonwine to loosen his tongue the strange merchant drank heavily but smirked unchanged by the draught then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended he offered his wine to his host and though carter took only the least sip he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles all the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirthcarter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tentlike awning on the deck of a ship with the marvellous coasts of the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness he was not chained but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches he saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellowdreamer of eartha lighthousekeeper in ancient kingsporthad often discoursed in the old days and recognised the templed terraces of zar abode of forgotten dreams the spires of infamous thalarion that daemoncity of a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns the charnal gardens of xura land of pleasures unattained and the twin headlands of crystal meeting above in a resplendent arch which guard the harbour of sonanyl blessed land of fancypast all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below and before the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the basalt pillars of the west beyond which simple folk say splendid cathuria lies but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earths dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemonsultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods blind voiceless tenebrous and mindless with their soul and messenger nyarlathotepmeanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest it is understood in the land of dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men and all these agents whether wholly human or slightly less than human are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger the crawling chaos nyarlathotep so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their castle on kadath had decided to take him away and deliver him to nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside carter could not guess nor could he imagine at what hellish trystingplace they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward he knew however that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central voidat the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around but when they gave carter a portion he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derivedit was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars and the deck grew damp and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken and carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and cometlike into planetary space never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity these are the nameless larvae of the other gods and like them are blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and thirstsbut that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably the ship made for the edge and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from the earth and which no fully human person save perhaps the dreamer snirethko has ever beheld the close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no wholesome or suitable gods and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to lurk some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution and what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been carter steadily refused to conjecturewhen the ship rounded the edge and sailed over those lands unseen by man there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life and carter saw many low broad round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi he noticed that these cottages had no windows and thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea and knew that the voyage was once more to be by wateror at least through some liquid the galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to carter they now slid along at great speed once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and starstrown even though the sun shone scorchingly in itthere presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprouslooking coast and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city the way they leaned and bent the manner in which they were clustered and the fact that they had no windows at all was very disturbing to the prisoner and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban as the coast drew nearer and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger he saw upon the jagged hills many forests some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moontree in the enchanted wood of earth from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar winecarter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them for they were not men at all or even approximately men but great greyishwhite slippery things which could expand and contract at will and whose principal shapethough it often changedwas that of a sort of toad without any eyes but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt vague snout these objects were waddling busily about the wharves moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws and now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in dylathleen only these herds being without turbans or shoes or clothing did not seem so very human after all some of these slavesthe fatter ones whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentallywere unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vansonce a van was hitched up and driven off and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that carter gasped even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toadthings as officers navigators and rowers and carter saw that the almosthuman creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength such as steering and cooking fetching and carrying and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded these creatures must have been convenient on earth for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations but most of them unless lean and illfavoured were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated some very like these semihumans some not so similar and some not similar at all and he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drayswhen the galley landed at a greasylooking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toadthings wiggled out of the hatches and two of them seized carter and dragged him ashore the smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling and carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows at length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness it was apparently all one to the toadthings whether it were light or dark the odour of the place was intolerable and when carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions it was circular and about twenty feet acrossfrom then on time ceased to exist at intervals food was pushed in but carter would not touch it what his fate would be he did not know but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinitys other gods the crawling chaos nyarlathotep finally after an unguessed span of hours or days the great stone door swung wide again and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the redlitten streets of that fearsome city it was night on the moon and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torchesin a detestable square a sort of procession was formed ten of the toadthings and twentyfour almosthuman torchbearers eleven on either side and one each before and behind carter was placed in the middle of the line five toadthings ahead and five behind and one almosthuman torchbearer on each side of him certain of the toadthings produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited carter could not doubt and he wished that the suspense might soon be over the whining of those impious flutes was shocking and he would have given worlds for some even halfnormal sound but these toadthings had no voices and the slaves did not talkthen through that starspecked darkness there did come a normal sound it rolled from the higher hills and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus it was the midnight yell of the cat and carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally springing from high housetops verily it is to the moons dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows and here amidst that column of foetid things carter heard their homely friendly cry and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of homenow much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable but that he need not have done for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions the call of the clan had been given and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it the flutes stopped and there were shrieks in the night dying almosthumans screamed and cats spit and yowled and roared but the toadthings made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungiit was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted and carter had never before seen so many cats black grey and white yellow tiger and mixed common persian and manx thibetan angora and egyptian all were there in the fury of battle and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of bubastis they would leap seven strong at the throat of an almosthuman or the pink tentacled snout of a toadthing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battlefury carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the frayat last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene the great shining disc of the earth thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array circle on circle they reached and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly of the dead slaves and toadthings there were not many signs but carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the beginning of the solid circles of the warriorscarter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate he had not been unmarked in ulthar when he passed through and the sleek old cats had remembered how he petted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten and they recalled too how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left the grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognised the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dreama yowl now came from a farther peak and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation it was one of the armys outposts stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earths cats fear the very large and peculiar cats from saturn who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moons dark side they are leagued by treaty with the evil toadthings and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matterafter a brief consultation of generals the cats rose and assumed a closer formation crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland the old fieldmarshal advised carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed he also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired and carter decided on the city of dylathleen whence the black galley had set out for he wished to sail thence for oriab and the carven crest of ngranek and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off then upon a signal the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst while in a black cave on a far unhallowed summit of the moonmountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotepthe leap of the cats through space was very swift and being surrounded by his companions carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at dylathleen and the stealthy friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams the old leader from ulthar was the last to leave and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow when dawn came carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving there was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways most of the townsfolk believed him yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the widemouthed merchants if aught of evil ever befalls dylathleen through such traffick it will not be his faultin about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black mole and tall lighthouse and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriabs inner groves and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna and the strange little figures carved from ngraneks ancient lava for this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in parg carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days and during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lavagatherers and imagemakers in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it the captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face for the wrong side of ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the nightgaunts but the captain did not wish to say just what a nightgaunt might be like since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them then carter asked that captain about unknown kadath in the cold waste and the marvellous sunset city but of these the good man could truly tell nothingcarter sailed out of dylathleen one early morning when the tide turned and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town and for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimneypots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying but on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of the water was stronger and soon passed from sight of any land on the fifth day the sailors were nervous but the captain apologised for their fears saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it he admitted moreover that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea having been hailed when quite close to it but never seen againthat night the moon was very bright and one could see a great way down in the water there was so little wind that the ship could not move much and the ocean was very calm looking over the rail carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of a great temple and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea as the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the washeddown walls of myriad little housesthen the suburbs appeared and finally a great lone building on a hill of simpler architecture than the other structures and in much better repair it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square with a tower at each corner a paved court in the centre and small curious round windows all over it probably it was of basalt though weeds draped the greater part and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or monastery some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court and saw that something was tied to it and when after getting a telescope from the captains cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab head downward and without any eyes he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the seathe next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar in the land of forgotten dreams with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and snowcrowned in the distance oriab is a very great isle and its port of baharna a mighty city the wharves of baharna are of porphyry and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath on whose farther shore are the vast claybrick ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome and in all the million windows of baharnas terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbourthe captain after landing made carter a guest in his own small house on the shore of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the travellers delight and in the days after that carter asked for rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lavagatherers and imagemakers meet but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it and besides one could never depend on the certainty that nightgaunts are altogether fabulouswhen the captain sailed back to dylathleen carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yaths farther shore here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek and correlated all that he had learned from the lavagatherers about the roads thither the keeper of the tavern was a very old man and had heard so many legends that he was a great help he even took carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the olden days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit ngraneks higher slopes the old tavernkeepers greatgrandfather had heard from his greatgrandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and seen the carven face here drawing it for others to behold but carter had very great doubts since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste with horns and wings and claws and curling tailsat last having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of baharna carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by yaths shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony ngranek on his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the skai by evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on yaths farther shore and though old lavagatherers had warned him not to camp there at night he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher around him he wrapped another blanket for the nights are cold in oriab and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin grovesthe sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath and carter looked about for his tethered zebra great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat his pack had been disturbed and several shiny knickknacks taken away and all around on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account the legends and warnings of lavagatherers occurred to him and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward ngranek though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peerhis course now led uphill through wilder and partly wooded country and he saw only the huts of charcoalburners and the camps of those who gathered resin from the groves the whole air was fragrant with balsam and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun near sunset he came on a new camp of lavagatherers returning with laden sacks from ngraneks lower slopes and here he also camped listening to the songs and tales of the men and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost he had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him and at nightfall did not return to his fellows when they looked for him the next day they found only his turban nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen they did not search any more because the old men among them said it would be of no use no one ever found what the nightgaunts took though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous carter asked them if nightgaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry when he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more but went to sleep in his blanketthe next day he rose with the lavagatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he had bought of them their older men gave him blessings and warnings and told him he had better not climb too high on ngranek but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded for still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown kadath and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset by noon after a long uphill ride he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hillpeople who had once dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeepers grandfather but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked their homes had crept even up the mountains slope and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose at last they decided it would be better to leave altogether since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in baharna inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of imagemaking which to this day they carry on it was from these children of the exiled hillpeople that carter had heard the best tales about ngranek when searching through baharnas ancient tavernsall this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and higher as carter approached it there were sparse trees on the lower slope and feeble shrubs above them and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it in places there were solid streams of lava and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges ninety aeons ago before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders now it towered all silent and sinister bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told and there were caves in that mountain which might be empty and alone with elder darkness or mightif legend spoke trulyhold horrors of a form not to be surmisedthe ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees and strown with bits of rock lava and ancient cinder there were the charred embers of many camps where the lavagatherers were wont to stop and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in ngraneks high passes and labyrinthine caves at evening carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blanket before going to sleep and all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool but carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of ngranekin the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin road became too steep thereafter he scrambled up alone first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there he regretted coming clear of the trees since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying at length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked around the deserted huts of the imagemakers the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten he found it best not to look around and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling tothen the soil became meagre with great patches of bare rock cropping out and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock and had it not been very rough and weathered he could scarcely have ascended farther knobs ledges and pinnacles however helped greatly and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some lavagatherer scratched clumsily in the friable stone and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him after a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent once or twice carter dared to look around and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below all the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight with baharnas stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance and beyond that the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secretsthus far there had been much winding around the mountain so that the farther and carven side was still hidden carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no culdesac but that it led steeply on in an arc which would unless suddenly interrupted or deflected bring him after a few hours climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava as new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed the mountains side too was somewhat different being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left some of these were above him and some beneath him all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man the air was very cold now but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it only the increasing rarity bothered him and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of nightgaunts whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths he was not much impressed by travellers tales but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown kadathat last in the fearsome iciness of upper space he came round fully to the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked the olden wrath of the great ones there was unfolded too a vast expanse of country to the south but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys and seemed to have no ending no trace of the sea was visible on this side for oriab is a great island black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs but none of them was accessible to a climber there now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view and carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable poised in windy insecurity miles above earth with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun ngraneks hidden side he could not turn round yet the sun was already low if there were no way aloft the night would find him crouching there still and the dawn would not find him at allbut there was a way and he saw it in due season only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds yet to carter they were sufficient surmounting now the outwardhanging rock he found the slope above much easier than that below since a great glaciers melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges to the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths with a caves dark mouth just out of reach above him elsewhere however the mountain slanted back strongly and even gave him space to lean and resthe felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight surely enough there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed hanging there forever in bold outline black against the white of the frozen peak and when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud and clutched at the jagged rock in awe for the titan bulge had not stayed as earths dawn had shaped it but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a godstern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire how vast it was no mind can ever measure but carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it it was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken and carter saw that it was indeed so for those long narrow eyes and longlobed ears and that thin nose and pointed chin all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods he clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie even though it was this which he had expected and come to find for there is in a gods face more of marvel than prediction can tell and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking down at sunset in the cryptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old the marvel is so strong that none may escape ithere too was the added marvel of recognition for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the gods children he now knew that he need not do so certainly the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport celephas which lies in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in waking life every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephas and it was clear that these could be no others than the halfgods he sought where they dwelt there must the cold waste lie close and within it unknown kadath and its onyx castle for the great ones so to celephas he must go far distant from the isle of oriab and in such parts as would take him back to dylathleen and up the skai to the bridge by nir and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of thran where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenerian seabut dusk was now thick and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow perched on that ledge night found the seeker and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley the stars came out but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes nothingness leagued with death against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reachsuddenly without a warning sound in the dark carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below and between him and the milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and batwinged other things too had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space another minute and the stars were gone and carter knew that the nightgaunts had got himthey bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond when he struggled as at first he did by instinct they tickled him with deliberation they made no sound at all themselves and even their membraneous wings were silent they were frightfully cold and damp and slippery and their paws kneaded one detestably soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling giddying sickening rush of dank tomblike air and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness he screamed again and again but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell and which is litten only by the pale deathfire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earths coreat last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled peaks of thok awful and sinister they stand in the haunted dusk of sunless and eternal depths higher than man may reckon and guarding terrible valleys where the bholes crawl and burrow nastily but carter preferred to look at them than at his captors which were indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth oily whalelike surfaces unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other batwings whose beating made no sound ugly prehensile paws and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly and worst of all they never spoke or laughed and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be all they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle that was the way of nightgauntsas the band flew lower the peaks of thok rose grey and towering on all sides and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impassive granite of the endless twilight at still lower levels the deathfires in the air gave out and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblinlike soon the peaks were very far away and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them then in the end the nightgaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones and left carter all alone in that black valley to bring him thither was the duty of the nightgaunts that guard ngranek and this done they flapped away silently when carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not since even the peaks of thok had faded out of sight there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bonesnow carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnath where crawl and burrow the enormous bholes but he did not know what to expect because no one has ever seen a bhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like bholes are known only by dim rumour from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one they cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark carter did not wish to meet a bhole so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective for whispers of pnath and its approaches were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days in brief it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than thoks peaks which marks the edge of their domain showers of bones would tell him where to look and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder for strange to say he had a very singular link with these terrible creaturesa man he had known in bostona painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyardhad actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering this man had vanished at last and carter was not sure but that he might find him now and use for the first time in dreamland that faraway english of his dim waking life in any case he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of pnath and it would be better to meet a ghoul which one can see than a bhole which one cannot seeso carter walked in the dark and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot once he bumped into a stony slope and knew it must be the base of one of thoks peaks then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls he was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below but realised that the inner world has strange laws as he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoulsound travels slowly so that it was some time before he heard an answering glibber but it came at last and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered the wait for this was very tense since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting indeed it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off as this thoughtfully approached he became more and more uncomfortable for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come finally the tension grew almost unbearable and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound it was the ladder and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands but the other sound did not cease and followed him even as he climbed he had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below at a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling and thereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed bhole whose form no man might seefor hours he climbed with aching arms and blistered hands seeing again the grey deathfire and thoks uncomfortable pinnacles at last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls whose vertical side he could not glimpse and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of notre dame this almost made him lose his hold through faintness but a moment later he was himself again for his vanished friend richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiouslyhe was now on a dimlitten plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows the ghouls were in general respectful even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world a greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickmans present habitation so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould they emerged on a dim plain strown with singular relics of earthold gravestones broken urns and grotesque fragments of monumentsand carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumberthere on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the granary burying ground in boston sat the ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman it was naked and rubbery and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure but it still remembered a little english and was able to converse with carter in grunts and monosyllables helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills it seemed rather doubtful for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland leaving that to the webfooted wamps that are spawned in dead cities and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood including the terrible kingdom of the gugsthe gugs hairy and gigantic once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos nyarlathotep until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earths gods and they were banished to caverns below only a great trapdoor of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earthghouls with the enchanted wood and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse that a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable for mortal dreamers were their former food and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts those repulsive beings which die in the light and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroosso the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss at sarkomand that deserted city in the valley below leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diorite lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood this however did not suit the seeker for he knew nothing of the way from leng to oothnargai and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream it were disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in celephas and who being the sons of gods must point the way to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwellafter much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs kingdom there was one chance that carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors and reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it which has the stairs leading up to that stone trapdoor in the enchanted wood pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see feasting therehe also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself shaving the beard he had allowed to grow for ghouls have none wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface and loping in the usual slumping way with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb they would reach the city of the gugswhich is coterminous with the whole kingdomthrough the proper burrows emerging in a cemetery not far from the staircontaining tower of koth they must beware however of a large cave near the cemetery for this is the mouth of the vaults of zin and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs for they cannot discriminate they are very primitive and eat one another the gugs have a sentry at a narrow place in the vaults of zin but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts though ghasts cannot live in real light they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hoursso at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of col nehemiah derby obiit 1719 from the charter street burying ground in salem when they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs on the right of the hole out of which they wriggled and seen through aisles of monoliths was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth this was the great city of the gugs whose doorways are thirty feet high ghouls come here often for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of pnathstraight ahead and just outside the cemetery rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness and truly that warning was soon well justified for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs resting had been rightly timed there glowed in the gloom of that great caverns mouth first one pair of yellowishred eyes and then another implying that the gugs were one sentry less and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight and carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose a forehead and other important particularspresently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow and a ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of battlescars was a bad sign it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all but merely slipped past him as he slept so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim it was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts and yet horrible as they were they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddennessit was a paw fully two feet and a half across and equipped with formidable talons after it came another paw and after that a great blackfurred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms then two pink eyes shone and the head of the awakened gug sentry large as a barrel wobbled into view the eyes jutted two inches from each side shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head opening vertically instead of horizontallybut before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet the vindictive ghasts were upon him carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression the battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug nipping and tearing with their muzzles and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves all the time they coughed excitedly screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern as it was the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuancethen the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace but even so the journey was no brief one for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale at last however they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in basrelief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning this was the central tower with the sign of koth and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted woodthere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps which were fashioned for gugs and were therefore nearly a yard high of their number carter could form no just estimate for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him all through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the great ones curse there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top so sharp are the ears of gugs that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants accustomed from their ghasthunts in the vaults of zin to seeing without light to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those cyclopean steps it was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs there was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs if the gugs slept long and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and illdisposed things in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gugthen after aeons of climbing there came a cough from the darkness above and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn it was clear that a ghast or perhaps even more had strayed into that tower before the coming of carter and his guides and it was equally clear that this peril was very close after a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight ghouls can see in the dark so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been alone in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast and the slabbearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow presently two yellowishred eyes flashed into view and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering as it hopped down to the step just above the ghouls they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap there seemed to be only this one animal and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again as before they were obliged to aid him and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghasts uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blacknessat last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt and feeling above him carter realised that the great stone trapdoor was reached at last to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop and permit carter to escape through the crack they themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs since their elusiveness was great and they did not know the way overland to spectral sarkomand with its lionguarded gate to the abyssmighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them and carter helped push with as much strength as he had they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles after a few moments a crack of light appeared and carter to whom that task had been entrusted slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture there now ensued a mighty heaving but progress was very slow and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal opensuddenly their desperation was magnified a thousandfold by a sound on the steps below them it was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghasts hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels but of all the possible causes of that bodys dislodgment and rolling none was in the least reassuring therefore knowing the ways of gugs the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst carter turned the slab and left a generous opening they now helped carter through letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside another second and they were through themselves knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trapdoor while a panting became audible beneath because of the great ones curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal so with a deep relief and sense of repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls restweird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago it was verily a haven and a delight after the gulfs he had now left behind there was no living denizen about for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course to return through the tower they no longer dared and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests nasht and kamanthah in the cavern of flame so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its gate of the abyss though of how to get there they knew nothing carter recalled that it lies in the valley below leng and recalled likewise that he had seen in dylathleen a sinister slanteyed old merchant reputed to trade on leng therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out dylathleen crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the river to its mouth this they at once resolved to do and lost no time in loping off since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was pickman but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left for a ghoul is a ghoul and at best an unpleasant companion for man after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carriedit was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day wherefore carter set out upon the wellknown route toward celephas in oothnargai beyond the tanarian hills and as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an ash tree on ngranek in faraway oriab so many aeons ago and wondered if any lavagatherer had fed and released it and he wondered too if he would ever return to baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by yaths shore and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamlandbut presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree he had avoided the great circle of stones since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern for a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs it all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions the matter had long rankled and now or within at least a month the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise this was the plan of the zoogs and carter saw that he must foil it before leaving on his mighty questvery quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields and a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small black grey tiger white yellow and mixed and it echoed through nir and beyond the skai even into ulthar and ulthars numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march it was fortunate that the moon was not up so that all the cats were on earth swiftly and silently leaping they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood carter was there to greet them and the sight of shapely wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss he was glad to see his venerable friend and onetime rescuer at the head of ulthars detachment a collar of rank around his sleek neck and whiskers bristling at a martial angle better still as a sublieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that longvanished morning in ulthar he was a strapping and promising cat now and purred as he shook hands with his friend his grandfather said he was doing very well in the army and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaigncarter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe and was rewarded by deepthroated purrs of gratitude from all sides consulting with the generals he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilisation of their army of invasion thereupon without a moments loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs they saw that they were beaten in advance and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present selfpreservationhalf the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the centre leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood terms were discussed at length carter acting as interpreter and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large annual tribute of grouse quail and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of their forest twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the temple of the cats at ulthar and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs these matters disposed of the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glancethe old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise this offer he welcomed with gratitude not only for the safety it afforded but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment relaxed after the successful performance of its duty randolph carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in the cold waste but did not know where it was as for the marvellous sunset city he had not even heard of that but would gladly relay to carter anything he might later learnhe gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in celephas whither he was bound that old cat already slightly known to carter was a dignified maltese and would prove highly influential in any transaction it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell the young sublieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army so carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willowfringed river and the cats went back into the woodwell did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the cerenerian sea and blithely did he follow the singing river oukranos that marked his course the sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle a blessed haze lies upon all this region wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold and a little more of the summers humming music of birds and bees so that men walk through it as through a faery place and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward rememberby noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to the rivers edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of ilekvad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukranos who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks all of jasper is that temple and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts its seven pinnacled towers and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests none but the king of ilekvad may say for only he has entered the temple or seen the priests now in the drowsiness of day that carven and delicate fane was silent and carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under an enchanted sunall that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukranos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side whose trees came down clear to the waters edge in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink but now he could not glimpse any once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird which it lured to the water by shewing its tempting scales in the sun and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon ittoward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows for they are more ancient than memory yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets the clustered towers within all white beneath their golden spires are loftier still so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky sometimes shining clear sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours and where thrans gates open on the river are great wharves of marble with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places landward beyond the walls lies the farm country where small white cottages dream between little hills and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardensdown through this verdant land carter walked at evening and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of thran and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate and was stopped by a redrobed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thrans steep mysterious streets and linger in bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold then into that incredible city he walked through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers lights shone through grated and balconied windows and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled carter knew his way and edged down through darker streets to the river where at an old seatavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams there he bought his passage to celephas on a great green galleon and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten godsin the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephas and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the cerenerian sea began for many leagues the banks were much as they were above thran with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right and a drowsy village on the shore with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun mindful of his search carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of celephas asking the names and ways of the strange men with long narrow eyes longlobed ears thin noses and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephas of these men the sailors knew not much save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about themtheir land very far away was called inganok and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land and said to be close to unpleasant leng although high impassable mountains towered on the side where leng was thought to lie so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon certainly men reached leng from very different oceans of other boundaries of inganok those sailors had no notion nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath save from vague unplaced report and of the marvellous sunset city which carter sought they knew nothing at all so the traveller asked no more of far things but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on ngraneklate in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of kled here carter wished he might disembark for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory lone and unbroken where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed for it is written that there may one day be need of them again and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due but the ship swept on and dusk hushed the hum of the day and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been and all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit themin the morning the river had broadened out greatly and carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea here the walls are of rugged granite and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland so that the city is not sought except for barter but is prized for the solid work of its artisans the wharves of hlanith are of oak and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns carter also went ashore and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden oxcarts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars the seataverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low blackbeamed ceilings and casements of greenish bullseye panes ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports and told many stories of the curious men from twilight inganok but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told then at last after much unloading and loading the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given themtwo nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its gingkotrees swaying on the lower slopes and carter knew that they were come to the land of oothnargai and the marvellous city of celephas swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues and the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea then rose the green gentle hills behind the town with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them and far in the background the purple ridge of the tanarians potent and mystical behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dreamthe harbour was full of painted galleys some of which were from the marble cloudcity of serannian that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spicefragrant wharves where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the citys million lights began to twinkle out over the water ever new seemed this deathless city of vision for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy as it has always been is still the turquoise temple of nathhorthath and the eighty orchidwreathed priests are the same who builded it ten thousand years ago shining still is the bronze of the great gates nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable yet without one grey hair in their forked beardscarter did not at once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors and when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he sought the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of inganok but was told that none were now in port their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks he found however one thorabonian sailor who had been to inganok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place and this sailor said there was certainly a desert to the north of the peopled region which everybody seemed to fear and shun the thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into lengs horrible plateau and that this was why men feared it though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown kadath stands he did not know but it seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels if indeed they truly existed were stationed for naughton the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the highpriest though nathhorthath is chiefly worshipped in celephas all the great ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods like atal in distant ulthar he strongly advised against any attempt to see them declaring that they are testy and capricious and subject to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish carter to reach it and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them no man had ever found kadath in the past and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuringhaving thanked the orchidcrowned highpriest carter left the temple and sought the bazaar of the sheepbutchers where the old chief of celephas cats dwelt sleek and contented that grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement and extended a languid paw as his caller approached but when carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of oothnargai best of all he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of celephas about the men of inganok on whose dark ships no cat will goit seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them though that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships the reason for this is that inganok holds shadows which no cat can endure so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical leng or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north none may say but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like and to which they are more sensitive than men therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of inganokthe old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king kuranes who in carters latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rosecrystal palace of the seventy delights at celephas and in the turreted cloudcastle of skyfloating serannian it seems that he could no more find content in those places but had formed a mighty longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood where in little dreaming villages englands old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys he could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the seacliffs to the foot of the tanarian hills there he dwelt in a grey gothic manorhouse of stone looking on the sea and tried to think it was ancient trevor towers where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light and on the coast nearby he had built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways settling therein such people as had the most english faces and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose tower he could see from his window placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon and with a moss somewhat like old englands moss for though kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream with all imagined pomps and marvels splendours and beauties ecstacies and delights novelties and excitements at his command he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet england that ancient beloved england which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a partso when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu he did not seek the terraced palace of rosecrystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the seacliffs and in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and anointed lackey of the palace but a small stubbly old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall and carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to englands trees and climbed the terraces among gardens set out as in queen annes time at the door flanked by stone cats in the old way he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery and was presently taken to the library where kuranes lord of oothnargai and the sky around serannian sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawnparty at the vicars with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patiencekuranes clad in a dressinggown of the sort favoured by london tailors in his youth rose eagerly to meet his guest for the sight of an anglosaxon from the waking world was very dear to him even if it was a saxon from boston massachusetts instead of from cornwall and for long they talked of old times having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places kuranes indeed had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyageat length carter brought up the subject of his quest and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others kuranes did not know where kadath was or the marvellous sunset city but he did know that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out and that the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of space especially in that region where form does not exist and coloured gases study the innermost secrets the violet gas sngac had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemonsultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark altogether it was not well to meddle with the elder ones and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city it were better not to seek that citykuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it he himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely celephas and the land of oothnargai and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains conventions and stupidities but now that he was come into that city and that land and was the king thereof he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories he was a king in oothnargai but found no meaning therein and drooped always for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth all his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over the downs and all the thousand minarets of celephas for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home so he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite the content he sought and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and halfremembered dream for he had visited carter often in the old waking days and knew well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birthat the last he was very certain the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes the glow of beacon hill at evening the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and witchhaunted arkham and the blessed miles of meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure these things he told randolph carter but still the seeker held to his purpose and in the end they parted each with his own conviction and carter went back through the bronze gate into celephas and down the street of the pillars to the old seawall where he talked more with the mariners of far parts and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inganok whose strangefaced sailors and onyxtraders had in them the blood of the great onesone starlight evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the longedfor ship put in and strangefaced sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the seawall it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features on ngranek but carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land they talked little with the other folk in those ancient seataverns but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland and so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melodyfor a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of celephas and before they sailed carter had taken passage on their dark ship telling them that he was an old onyxminer and wishful to work in their quarries that ship was very lovely and cunningly wrought being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted and as carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunriseblazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless celephas sink into the distance and the snowy peak of mount aran grow smaller and smaller by noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea with one painted galley afar off bound for that cloudhung realm of serannian where the sea meets the skyand night came with gorgeous stars and the dark ship steered for charles wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea carter went to sleep at midnight and rose in the glow of a young morning marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont and all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land of their exquisite onyx city and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which leng was said to be they told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of inganok and how they thought the hidden nearness of leng was to blame for it only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk there was something disquieting about that desert and it was thought expedient not to admit its existenceon later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was going to work there were many of them for all the city of inganok was builded of onyx whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in rinar ogrothan and celephas and at home with the merchants of thraa ilarnek and kadatheron for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports and far to the north almost in that cold desert whose existence the men of inganok did not care to admit there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld who had mined those incredible blocks and whither they had been transported no man might say but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling so it was left all alone in the twilight with only the raven and the rumoured shantakbird to brood on its immensities when carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought for he knew from old tales that the great ones castle atop unknown kadath is of onyxeach day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker and in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night on the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar the first land glimpsed since arans snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship carter asked the captain the name of that rock but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night and when after dark a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place the traveller was glad that no stop had been made and that the rock had no name the seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot and carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hourstwo mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs and some knelt down on the deck to pray so that carter knew they were come to the land of inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that lands name toward noon a dark coastline appeared and before three oclock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays all of delicate black with scrolls flutings and arabesques of inlaid gold tall and manywindowed were the houses and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination the walls were low and pierced by frequent gates each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant ngranek on a hill in the centre rose a sixteenangled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome this the seamen said was the temple of the elder ones and was ruled by an old highpriest sad with inner secretsat intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns viols and chanting voices and from a row of tripods on a gallery round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts as the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest and carter saw the slaves sailors and merchants on the docks the sailors and merchants were of the strangefaced race of the gods but the slaves were squat slanteyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from valleys beyond leng the wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar ogrothan and celephasit was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city the streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow the houses near the water were lower than the rest and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each the captain of the ship took carter to an old seatavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city and lead him to the taverns of the onyxminers by the northern wall and evening fell and little bronze lamps were lighted and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places but when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away for there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of inganok and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly closefar in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not like for it was unmistakably that of the old slanteyed merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of dylathleen who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar and even to have dealt with that highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and kadath and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inganok so close to the wonders of the north was not a reassuring thing he slipped wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined bearing the colossal and richflavoured eggs of the rumoured shantakbird to trade for the dexterous jade goblets that merchants brought from ilarnekon the following morning the shipcaptain led carter through the onyx streets of inganok dark under their twilight sky the inlaid doors and figured housefronts carven balconies and crystalpaned oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars colonnades and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous some of the vistas down long and unbending streets or through side alleys and over bulbous domes spires and arabesqued roofs were weird and beautiful beyond words and nothing was more splendid than the massive height of the great central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides its flattened dome and its lofty pinnacled belfry overtopping all else and majestic whatever its foreground and always to the east far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous leng was said to liethe captain took carter to the mighty temple which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheels hub the seven arched gates of that garden each having over it a carven face like those on the citys gates are always open and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods and there are fountains pools and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony all of onyx and having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean when the deep clang from the temples belfry shivers over the garden and the city and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates there issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in black bearing at arms length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises and all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file legs thrown far forward without bending the knees down the walks that lead to the seven lodges wherein they disappear and do not appear again it is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple and that the long files of priests return through them nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told but only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human priestscarter did not enter the temple because none but the veiled king is permitted to do that but before he left the garden the hour of the bell came and he heard the shivering clang deafeningly above him and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of bowlbearing priests in their singular way giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give when the last of them had vanished he left that garden noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed even the shipcaptain did not like that spot and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled kings palace rises manydomed and marvellousthe ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow all but that broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yakdrawn chariots carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance always ahead loomed those titan walls mighty buttresses and clustered and bulbous domes for which the veiled kings palace is famous and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarchs pleasure there carter paused in faintness at so much of beauty for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks the gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices the brazen urns and tripods with cunning basreliefs the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble the basaltbottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality and halffabulous even in the land of dream there it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right and ever the small birds and the fountains sang while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden no other human presence was there and carter was glad it was so then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps for the palace itself no visitor may enter and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantakbirds and to send out queer dreams to the curiousafter that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town near the gate of the caravans where are the taverns of the yakmerchants and the onyxminers and there in a lowceiled inn of quarrymen they said farewell for business called the captain whilst carter was eager to talk with miners about the north there were many men in that inn and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them saying that he was an old miner of onyx and anxious to know somewhat of inganoks quarries but all that he learnt was not much more than he knew before for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits they had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is said to lie and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks and they whispered also that the rumoured shantakbirds are no wholesome things it being indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one for that fabled father of shantaks in the kings dome is fed in the darkthe next day saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of inganok carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddlebags for a journey beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions once finding a host so austere and reticent and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves or upon one with full ninetenths of their blood dwelling amongst men and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded himthat night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygathtree to which he tied his yak and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage at about ten oclock he reached the smalldomed village of urg where traders rest and miners tell their tales and paused in its taverns till noon it is here that the great caravan road turns west toward selarn but carter kept on north by the quarry road all the afternoon he followed that rising road which was somewhat narrower than the great highway and which now led through a region with more rocks than tilled fields and by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizeable black cliffs so that he knew he was close to the mining country all the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right and the farther he went the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering onyxcarts along the wayon the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground he observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at this northerly point and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them and on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels before evening he had passed eleven quarries the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders with no vegetation at all but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right the third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west and they sang many songs and told many tales shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the great ones they asked him whither he went and cautioned him not to go too far to the north but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors in the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than mens hands had wrenched prodigious blocks but he did not like it when turning back to wave a last farewell he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant dylathleenafter two more quarries the inhabited part of inganok seemed to end and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yakpath among forbidding black cliffs always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time once in a while a raven would croak far overhead and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured shantakbird but in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak become more and more reluctant to advance and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the routethe path now contracted between sable and glistening walls and began to display an even greater steepness than before it was a bad footing and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strown thickly about in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course to reach this crest however was no easy task for the way had grown nearly perpendicular and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones eventually carter dismounted and led his dubious yak pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled and keeping his own footing as best he might then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond and gasped at what he sawthe path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down with the same lines of high natural walls as before but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space vast acres in extent where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giants quarry far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge and deep down within earths bowels its lower delvings yawned it was no quarry of man and the concave sides were scarred with great squares yards wide which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels high over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarryall at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom but carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed soon the lefthand cliffs resumed their course making the way once more a narrow lane and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flightonce he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast and doubled his speed from this encouragement he was covering miles and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north the gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the righthand crags and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark and limitless plain and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears plainer than before but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak these beats were ruthless and purposeful and they were behind himcarters pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable his yak must have heard or felt it first and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost he could not see the hoofprints of his yak but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings that he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its placethen dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing he had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains but now he saw it was something more the phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly and even silhouetted parts of it as low vapours glowed behind how distant it was he could not tell but it must have been very far it was thousands of feet high stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills but now those hills were hills no more for some hand greater than mans had touched them silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever all in a great half circle they squatted those doglike mountains carven into monstrous watching statues and their right hands were raised in menace against mankindit was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy laps great forms whose motions were no delusion winged and whirring those forms grew larger each moment and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end they were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horses carter knew that they must be the shantakbirds of ill rumour and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert and as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him where indeed was trotting the squat slanteyed trader of evil legend grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pitstrapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles randolph carter did not lose consciousness lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him while the slanteyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive then the man motioned carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks helping him up as his judgment struggled with his loathing it was hard work ascending for the shantakbird has scales instead of feathers and those scales are very slippery once he was seated the slanteyed man hopped up behind him leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossithere now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which leng was said to lie far above the clouds they flew till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of inganok have never seen and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on ngranek but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horseheaded shantak appeared oddly fearful of them hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rearthe shantak now flew lower revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light and there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inganoks people are right in their geographick rumours for travellers have heard such sounds before and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit that haunted place of evil and mystery which is lengaround the feeble fires dark forms were dancing and carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be for no healthy folk have ever been to leng and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold so that carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau as the shantak flew lower the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures beforethey leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns of other clothing they had none but most of them were quite furry behind they had dwarfish tails and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths then he knew what they were and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all for the cryptic folk of leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at dylathleen those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moonthings they were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long ago and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moonbut the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow day came and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence at times the slanteyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass all this while the land was getting higher and finally they came to a windswept tableland which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world there all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building around which a circle of crude monoliths stood in all this arrangement there was nothing human and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the highpriest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotepthe loathsome bird now settled to the ground and the slanteyed man hopped down and helped his captive alight of the purpose of his seizure carter now felt very sure for clearly the slanteyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx castle it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the moonthings in dylathleen and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried leng and the cold waste north of inganok must be close to the other gods and there the passes to kadath are well guardedthe slanteyed man was small but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed so carter followed where he led and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery there were no lights inside but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid basreliefs and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors on the walls of the corridors were painted frightful scenes older than history and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth after countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still for the cold and dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp and shuddered at the tale they toldthrough those archaic frescoes lengs annals stalked and the horned hooved and widemouthed almosthumans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities there were scenes of old wars wherein lengs almosthumans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon and of the submission of lengs people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them those slippery greyishwhite blasphemies they worshipped as gods nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys the monstrous moonbeasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea and carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to inganok that grey accursed rock which inganoks seamen shun and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the nightand in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almosthumans proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves and wondrous with high fanes and carven places great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinxcrowned gates to a vast central plaza and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase again and again were those huge winged lions shewn their mighty flanks of diorite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night and as carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were and what city it was that the almosthumans had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys there could be no mistake for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied sarkomand whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyssother views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inganok and the monstrous shantakbirds that build nests on the ledges half way up and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them carter had seen those caves when he passed over them and had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens and those batwings curving horns barbed tails prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him he had met those silent flitting and clutching creatures before those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones fear and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord for they were the dreaded nightgaunts who never laugh or smile because they have no faces and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the vale of pnath and the passes to the outer worldthe slanteyed merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking basreliefs and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring there was no light in this vast and evilsmelling crypt and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little at the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face to this being the slanteyed man made certain signs with his hands and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silkcovered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask this colloquy went on for some time and to carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place it made him think of a frightful redlitten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it of that and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond before the rescuing rush of earths friendly cats he knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the highpriest not to be described of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities but he feared to think just what that abhorred highpriest might bethen the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyishwhite paws and carter knew what the noisome highpriest was and in that hideous second stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold tableland outside and that even on that tableland the noxious shantak still waited yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling silkrobed monstrositythe slanteyed man had set his curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altarstones by the pit and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the highpriest with his hands carter hitherto wholly passive now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark in almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridorsafter a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in true they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good but he wished none the less he had made the attempt those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside in time he became quite sure he was not followed and slackened his pace somewhat but scarce had he breathed in halfrelief when a new peril beset him his lamp was waning and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidancewhen the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark and prayed to the great ones for such help as they might afford at times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist the farther he went the damper it seemed to be and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least he believed though that his general course was down and the vaultlike smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in lengs unwholesome tableland but there was not any warning of the thing which came at last only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breathtaking chaos one moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been wellnigh verticalof the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy then he realised he was still with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him all around were crumbling walls and broken columns and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come ahead stretched double rows of pillars and the fragments and pedestals of pillars that spoke of a broad and bygone street and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things huge winged lions of diorite they were with blackness and shadow between them full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads and snarled derisive on the ruins around them and carter knew right well what they must be for legend tells of only one such twain they were the changeless guardians of the great abyss and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomandcarters first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around he wished no follower from lengs hateful monastery for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers of how to get from sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls since he knew they were no better informed than he the three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach sarkomand in their journey back but had planned to ask old traders in dylathleen he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed over lengs plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided for the highpriests emissaries must be many while at the journeys end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with if he could get a boat he might sail back to inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from sarkomands basalt quays but to find a boat in this aeondeserted city was no probable thing and it did not appear likely that he could ever make onesuch were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind all this while there had stretched before him the great corpselike width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinxcrowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city the glow rose and fell fitfully flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher and when he crept closer down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor and carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moonthen just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear and crept forward again instead of retreating once in crossing an open street he wriggled wormlike on his stomach and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole greenlitten scene of action there around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi there squatted a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their almosthuman slaves some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames and at intervals applying their whitehot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that the bluntsnouted moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native deepsthe number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess but fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in dylathleen concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the highpriest not to be described for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls black kingdom clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley it occurred to him that the portal like other gates to the abyss might be guarded by flocks of nightgaunts but he did not fear these faceless creatures now he had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls and the ghoul which was pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understoodso carter began another silent crawl through the ruins edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions it was ticklish work but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunted trees and briers that had grown up therein the gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard ten feet apart crouched the mockingfaced beasts of diorite brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled into fearsome basreliefs betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx midway in this space a black well opened and carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmareterrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs so worn and narrow were the steps and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian nightgaunts would suddenly pounce upon him if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage all about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind in time he became very numb and somnolent moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will nor did he realise any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind he was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery nightgaunts had performed their dutyawaked to the fact that he was in the cold damp clutch of the faceless flutterers carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight mindless though nightgaunts are said to be the effect was instantaneous for all tickling stopped at once and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position thus encouraged carter ventured some explanations telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moonbeasts and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them the nightgaunts though inarticulate seemed to understand what was said and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place and as carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery doglike tenants the nightgaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomercarter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared and made significant signs to the nightgaunts causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of nightgaunts on the plain till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled nightgaunts in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist richard pickman of boston and to him carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred the erstwhile pickman surprised to greet his ancient friend again seemed very much impressed and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throngfinally after scanning the ranks with care the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and nightgaunts a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended fore legs awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one as each ghoul reached the pair of nightgaunts to which he was assigned he was taken up and borne away into the blackness till at last the whole throng had vanished save for carter pickman and the other chiefs and a few pairs of nightgaunts pickman explained that nightgaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls and that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp slippery paws another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness endlessly up up up to the gate of the winged lions and the spectral ruins of primal sarkomandwhen after a great interval carter saw again the sickly light of sarkomands nocturnal sky it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and nightgaunts day he felt sure must be almost due but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless nightgaunts ahead the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame carter was now beside pickman in the front rank of ghouls and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts were totally unprepared the three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order the almosthuman slaves were asleep even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctorythe final swoop of the nightgaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almosthuman slaves being seized by a group of nightgaunts before a sound was made the moonbeasts of course were voiceless and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic nightgaunts clutched them but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons when a moonbeast writhed too violently a nightgaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles carter expected to see much slaughter but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans they glibbered certain simple orders to the nightgaunts which held the captives trusting the rest to instinct and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the great abyss to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes gugs ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moonbeasts and boarded the evilsmelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat surely enough the capture had been thorough for not a sign of further life could the victors detect carter anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland urged them not to sink the anchored galley and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio on the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations some of which carter cast at once into the seaghouls and nightgaunts now formed themselves in separate groups the former questioning their rescued fellows anent past happenings it appeared that the three had followed carters directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to dylathleen by way of nir and the skai stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a mans walk in dylathleens taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment but they had persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them then they knew that only a ship for lelagleng would serve their purpose and prepared to wait patiently for such a vesselbut evil spies had doubtless reported much for shortly a black galley put into port and the widemouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had once found himself this time however the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique sarkomand bent evidently on taking their captives before the highpriest not to be described they had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inganoks mariners shun and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the real masters of the ship being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour there too were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident garrisonsuch pastimes as give rise to the nighthowlings which men fear after that had come the landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures whose continuance the present rescue had preventedfuture plans were next discussed the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there to this however the nightgaunts objected since the prospect of flying over water did not please them most of the ghouls favoured the design but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged nightgaunts thereupon carter seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars to which proposal they eagerly assented grey day had now come and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers benches carter found them fairly apt at learning and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour not till three days later however did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest then the rowers trained and the nightgaunts safely stowed in the forecastle the party set sail at last pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing modes of approach and procedureon the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard such was their timbre that all the galleys crew shook visibly but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky the sides of the rock were very steep but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings and the low railings guarding travelled high roads no ship of men had ever come so near the place or at least had never come so near and departed again but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlandsthe headlands were prolongations of the island proper and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them there seemed to be no watchers on the outside so the galley was steered boldly through the flumelike strait and into the stagnant foetid harbour beyond here however all was bustle and activity with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay and scores of almosthuman slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouragingat sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness those with eyes staring intently and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly they did not of course realise that the black ship had changed hands for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almosthumans and the nightgaunts were all out of sight below by this time the leaders had fully formed a plan which was to loose the nightgaunts as soon as the wharf was touched and then to sail directly away leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures marooned on the rock the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there and afterward quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark from which not much would emerge alivethe ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the nightgaunts their simple instructions while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almosthuman slaves whose places they were taking some silent alarm must have been given for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring nightgaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean batsthe jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship but when the nightgaunts struck them they thought of such things no more it was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell when the last of the nightgaunts had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquestthe pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the nightgaunts to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men night fell and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the nightgaunts flight toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the topmost pinnacle and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast once or twice something seemed to fall from the thinning swarm into the sea but carter did not worry since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts cannot swim at length when the ghouls were satisfied that all the nightgaunts had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their doomed burdens the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stonefrightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many and in various stages of departure from their primal state carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive the stenchfilled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moontrees and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs countless weapons implements and ornaments lay about including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth these latter did not despite their material invite either appropriation or long inspection and carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces the scattered spears and javelins he collected and with pickmans approval distributed among the ghouls such devices were new to the doglike lopers but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hintsthe upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the mild gods atop kadath from the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions whose vaultings were covered with daemoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of leng where broods alone the highpriest not to be described on the distant shadowy side beyond the noisome well he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts and had profited in their fashion they had also found a hogshead of potent moonwine and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings though the rescued trio remembering its effect on them in dylathleen had warned their company to taste none of it of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store both rough and polished in one of the vaults near the water but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them carter did not try to carry any away since he knew too much about those which had mined themsuddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing and it could be but a moment before the almosthumans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter had distributed amongst them and at his command sustained by the being that was pickman they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crews discovery of the changed state of things and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account after a moment of hesitation the newcomers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemys course would bein a very few minutes a ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts and almosthumans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flumelike strait but only for a second then a few moments later a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for the ship itself moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible useby this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party the sea party commanded by carter boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea carter did not at once pursue it for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the townmeanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almosthumans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky the thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine and the general effect of those hybrid halfamorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama javelins began to fly from both sides and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almosthumans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubblesfor half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated on the east cliff however where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present the ghouls had not fared so well and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat then when the western battle was over the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hardpressed fellows turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland the almosthumans were by this time all slain but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws the time for javelins was now nearly past and the fight became a handtohand contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridgeas fury and recklessness increased the number falling into the sea became very great those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts the cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battleline some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above but a few survived to be rescued when the security of the land parties seemed assured carters galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the wayfinally the moonbeasts galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemys rear after which the fight was shortlived indeed attacked from both sides the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them the hostile galley meanwhile had disappeared and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victorsso by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care finding that over a fourth had been lost in the days battles the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley for pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating ones own wounded and the ablebodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed and carter was not sorry to be departing from that island of unwholesome secrets whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy dawn found the ship in sight of sarkomands ruined quays of basalt where a few nightgaunt sentries still waited squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of manthe ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand despatching a messenger for enough nightgaunts to serve them as steeds pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid carter had lent them and carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown kadath and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into doubleheaded images which guard it he spoke of the fear of shantaks for nightgaunts and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide inganok from hateful leng he spoke too of the things he had learnt concerning nightgaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the highpriest not to be described how even the great ones fear them and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at all but hoary and immemorial nodens lord of the great abyssall these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers he wished very much he said for the services of enough nightgaunts to bear him safely through the air past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains and up into the cold waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal he desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him and felt sure that the nightgaunts could take him thither without trouble high above the perils of the plain and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them and even were unexpected things to come from the other gods who are prone to oversee the affairs of earths milder gods the nightgaunts need not fear for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master but bow only to potent and archaic nodensa flock of ten or fifteen nightgaunts carter glibbered would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men the party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth if any ghouls chose to escort him into the throneroom of the great ones he would be thankful for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea he would not however insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself in case the gods proved favourable or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitlesswhilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those nightgaunts for which messengers had been sent the winged horrors settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with its fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at most expected as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned lending him not merely a few of their allied nightgaunts but their entire army as they encamped veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled nightgaunts alike save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea they would set out through the air whenever he might wish and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earths gods in their onyx castlemoved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage the army would fly high they decided over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the shantakfrightening nightgaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits they would then according to what advice they might receive from those denizens choose their final course approaching unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of inganok or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng itself doglike and soulless as they are the ghouls and nightgaunts had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mysteryabout midday the ghouls and nightgaunts prepared for flight each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman and in front of the whole a double line of riderless nightgaunts was provided as a vanguard at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial sarkomand higher and higher till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared and the cold sterile tableland of lengs outskirts laid open to sight still higher flew the black host till even this tableland grew small beneath them and as they worked northward over the windswept plateau of horror carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silkenmasked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the sterile landscape passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved horned almosthumans that dance and pipe eternally therein once they saw a shantakbird flying low over the plain but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panicat dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of inganok and hovered about those strange caves near the summits which carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks at the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and nightgaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures it soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of inganok for lengs northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the nightgaunts dislike abysmal influences centring in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotepof kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard they hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally but of definite data they had nothing to give so carter and his party thanked them kindly and crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of inganok dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rockthere they squatted in a hellish halfcircle their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds sinister wolflike and doubleheaded with faces of fury and right hands raised dully and malignly watching the rim of mans world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not mans from their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of nightgaunts was sighted in the misty sky northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose less and less luminous grew the clouds till at length carter could see only blackness around him but never did the winged steeds falter bred as they were in earths blackest crypts and seeing not with any eyes but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms on and on they flew past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import ever in thickest darkness and covering such prodigious spaces that carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earths dreamlandthen suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above all below was still black but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere it was not that the figures of the constellations were different but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain everything focussed toward the north every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of inganok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence it was more broken now with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles and carter studied closely the suggestive turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urgethey were flying past at a tremendous speed so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party the ghouls had likewise glimpsed it for he heard their low glibbering all about him and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen soon however he saw that this theory would not hold for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird its outline against the stars necessarily vague as it was resembled rather some huge mitred head or pair of heads infinitely magnified and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleftthen came a wide gap in the range where the hideous reaches of transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass through which the stars shone wanly carter watched this gap with intense care knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles the object had now floated ahead a trifle and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in fulllength silhouette gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army for another minute suspense was keen and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and halfchoked meep of cosmic fear and to the soul of the traveller a chill that has never wholly left it for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a heada mitred double headand below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it the mountainhigh monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence the hyaenalike distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky its repulsive pair of conecapped heads reaching half way to the zenithcarter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud for he was an old dreamer but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks bobbing along stealthily after the first one and straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the air the carven mountains then had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of inganok with right hands uplifted they had duties to perform and were not remiss but it was horrible that they never spoke and never even made a sound in walkingmeanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the nightgaunts and the whole army soared higher into the air up toward the stars the grotesque column shot till nothing stood out any longer against the sky neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven and mitred mountains that walked all was blackness beneath as the fluttering legions surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them the farther they went the faster they flew till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasised their northward focus gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance thereinthen he noticed with terror that the wings of the nightgaunts were not flapping any more the horned and faceless steeds had folded their membraneous appendages and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on a force not of earth had seized on the army and ghouls and nightgaunts alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned at length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead thereafter rising steadily as they approached and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the airhigher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it till half the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass lofty as the army was that pale and sinister beacon rose above it towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel no mountain known of man was that which loomed before them the high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills the gasping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven black in eternal night and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment clearer ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliffhigher and higher rose the light till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery all the north beneath it was blackness now dread stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision carter studied the light more closely and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the stars there were towers on that titan mountaintop horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man battlements and terraces of wonder and menace all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought and in it glowed the daemonlight then randolph carter knew that his quest was done and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions the fabulous the incredible home of the great ones atop unknown kadatheven as he realised this thing carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly windsucked party they were rising abruptly now and it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone so close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above and carter could see that it was wellnigh blasphemous in its immensity well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of inganok for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as an ant on the steps of earths loftiest fortress the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow sickly flare so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx the pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse it was a strangely arched window of a design wholly alien to earththe solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated vast walls shot up and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept all was night in the titan courtyard and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx and carter could never tell what cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless arial twisting always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness and never a sound touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery large as the army of ghouls and nightgaunts was it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle and when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon it took carter long to discern the far walls and high distant ceiling and to realise that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outsiderandolph carter had hoped to come into the throneroom of the great ones with poise and dignity flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers he had known that the great ones themselves are not beyond a mortals power to cope with and had trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment as they had so often done before when men sought out earths gods in their home or on their mountains and with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters and that nightgaunts own not nyarlathotep but only archaick nodens for their lord but now he saw that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels and that the other gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild feeble gods of earth void as they are of lordship over ghouls and nightgaunts the mindless shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that randolph carter came into the great ones throneroom with his ghouls swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolvedbefore no golden dais had randolph carter come nor was there any august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes longlobed ears thin nose and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray save for that one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark and the masters were not there carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold waste but he had not found the gods yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin curling mists earths gods were not there it was true but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack where the mild gods are absent the other gods are not unrepresented and certainly the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless in what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could by no means imagine he felt that his visit had been expected and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos nyarlathotep it is nyarlathotep horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods that the fungous moonbeasts serve and carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the jagged rock in the seareflecting upon these things he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that palelitten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet three times pealed that frightful brazen scream and when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw that he was alone whither why and how the ghouls and nightgaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him to divine he knew only that he was suddenly alone and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earths friendly dreamland presently from the chambers uttermost reaches a new sound came this too was a rhythmic trumpeting but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had dissolved his grisly cohorts in this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence odours of incense came to match the golden notes and overhead a great light dawned its colours changing in cycles unknown to earths spectrum and following the song of the trumpet in weird symphonic harmonies torches flared in the distance and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancyout of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incense filed twin columns of giant black slaves with loincloths of iridescent silk upon their heads were strapped vast helmetlike torches of glittering metal from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn armlets and anklets of gold they had and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober gait that they were true black men of earths dreamland was at once apparent but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth ten feet from carter the columns stopped and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearers thick lips wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artificethen down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode a tall slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light close up to carter strode that regal figure whose proud carriage and swart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour it spoke and in its mellow tones there rippled the mild music of lethean streamsrandolph carter said the voice you have come to see the great ones whom it is unlawful for men to see watchers have spoken of this thing and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the daemonsultan whose name no lips dare speak aloudwhen barzai the wise climbed hathegkla to see the great ones dance and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned the other gods were there and they did what was expected zenig of aphorat sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste and his skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not namebut you randolph carter have braved all things of earths dreamland and burn still with the flame of quest you came not as one curious but as one seeking his due nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your dreams and wholly through their own small covetousness for verily they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned and vowed that henceforward no other spot should be their abodethey are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your marvellous city all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades arched bridges and silverbasined fountains and wide streets with blossomladen urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows and when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the towns steep northward slopes where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candlesthe gods love your marvellous city and walk no more in the ways of the gods they have forgotten the high places of earth and the mountains that knew their youth the earth has no longer any gods that are gods and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered kadath far away in a valley of your own childhood randolph carter play the heedless great ones you have dreamed too well o wise archdreamer for you have drawn dreams gods away from the world of all mens visions to that which is wholly yours having builded out of your boyhoods small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone beforeit is not well that earths gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of others fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you randolph carter who are the cause of their upsetting but that they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world in that halfwaking dreamland which is yours no power of uttermost night may pursue and only you can send the selfish great ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city back through the northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold wasteso randolph carter in the name of the other gods i spare you and charge you to serve my will i charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours and to send thence the drowsy truant gods for whom the dreamworld waits not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder for truly it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path behold it is not over unknown seas but back over wellknown years that your quest must go back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sundrenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyesfor know you that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth it is the glory of bostons hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset of the flowerfragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the manybridged charles flows drowsily these things you saw randolph carter when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love and there is antique salem with its brooding years and spectral marblehead scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries and the glory of salems towers and spires seen afar from marbleheads pastures across the harbour against the setting sunthere is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater arkham is there with its mossgrown gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it and antediluvian kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables and the marvel of high cliffs and the milkymisted ocean with tolling buoys beyondcool vales in concord cobbled lanes in portsmouth twilight bends of rustic newhampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking wellsweeps gloucesters salt wharves and truros windy willows vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the north shore hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in rhodeislands back country scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn these randolph carter are your city for they are yourself newengland bore you and into your soul she poured a liquid loveliness which cannot die this loveliness moulded crystallised and polished by years of memory and dreaming is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhoodlook through that window shine the stars of eternal night even now they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream there is antareshe is winking at this moment over the roofs of tremont street and you could see him from your window on beacon hill out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me some day you too may traverse them but if you are wise you will beware such folly for of those mortals who have been and returned only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding clawing horrors of the void terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter you and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been elsewhere busy and certain that you would yourself find the way shun then the outer hells and stick to the calm lovely things of your youth seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant great ones sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth and which wait uneasy for their returneasier even than the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for you see there comes hither a monstrous shantak led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep invisible mount and be readythere yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror steer for that brightest star just south of the zenithit is vega and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city steer for it only till you hear a faroff singing in the high aether higher than that lurks madness so rein your shantak when the first note lures look then back to earth and you will see shining the deathless altarflame of irednaa from the sacred roof of a temple that temple is in your desiderate sunset city so steer for it before you heed the singing and are lostwhen you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the outspread glory prodding the shantak till he cry aloud that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your citys wonders will not console them for the absence of kadaths grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns itthen must you land amongst them with the shantak and let them see and touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown kadath which you will so lately have left and telling them how its boundless halls are lonely and unlighted where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance and the shantak will talk to them in the manner of shantaks but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder daysover and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home and youth till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten thereat can you loose the waiting shantak sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind hearing which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods through the deep gulfs of heaven to kadaths familiar towers and domesthen will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit forever and once more will earths gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat go nowthe casement is open and the stars await outside already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience steer for vega through the night but turn when the singing sounds forget not this warning lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness remember the other gods they are great and mindless and terrible and lurk in the outer voids they are good gods to shunhei aashanta nyghyou are off send back earths gods to their haunts on unknown kadath and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms farewell randolph carter and bewarefor i am nyarlathotep the crawling chaosand randolph carter gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earths dreamland great polypous horrors slid darkly past and unseen batwings beat multitudinous around him but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird the stars danced mockingly almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared before and ever the winds of aether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmosthen through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible there rose a timid hint of faroff melody droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not and as that music grew the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead and carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain it was a song but not the song of any voice night and the spheres sang it and it was old when space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were bornfaster flew the shantak and lower bent the rider drunk with the marvels of strange gulfs and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic then came too late the warning of the evil one the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of those truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at will for madness and the voids wild vengeance are nyarlathoteps only gifts to the presumptuous and frantick though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed that leering tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinitys centre the mindless daemonsultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloudunswerving and obedient to the foul legates orders that hellish bird plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and pawed the nameless larvae of the other gods that are like them blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and thirstsonward unswerving and relentless and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and hysterics into which the siren song of night and the spheres had turned that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider hurtling and shooting cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter and darting meteorlike through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time wherein black azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled maddening beat of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutesonwardonwardthrough the screaming cackling and blackly populous gulfsand then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to randolph carter the doomed too well had nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising for he had brought up

visions of your wistful boyhoodonwardonwarddizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered but the image and the thought had come and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his infancy still lay words came againyou need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood turnturnblackness on every side but randolph carter could turnthick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses randolph carter could turn and move he could move and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of nyarlathotep he could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos core he could turn and move and leaphe couldhe wouldhe wouldoff that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell aeons reeled universes died and were born again stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars and still randolph carter fell through those endless voids of sentient blacknessthen in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into another futile completion and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before matter and light were born anew as space once had known them and comets suns and worlds sprang flaming into life though nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone been and gone always and always back to no first beginningand there was a firmament again and a wind and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the falling dreamer there were gods and presences and wills beauty and evil and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamers boyhood and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things out of the void sngac the violet gas had pointed the way and archaic nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deepsstars swelled to dawns and dawns burst into fountains of gold carmine and purple and still the dreamer fell cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside and hoary nodens raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep close on his quarry stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless huntinghorrors to grey dust randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city for he was come again to the fair new england world that had wrought himso to the organ chords of mornings myriad whistles and dawns blaze thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the state house on the hill randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within his boston room birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his masters start and shriek had disturbed and vast infinities away past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden lands and the cerenerian sea and the twilight reaches of inganok the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city,1
whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams walter gilman did not know behind everything crouched the brooding festering horror of the ancient town and of the mouldy unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed his ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery at night the subtle stirring of the black city outside the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium the darkness always teemed with unexplained soundand yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises which he suspected were lurking behind themhe was in the changeless legendhaunted city of arkham with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the kings men in the dark olden days of the province nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured himfor it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old keziah mason whose flight from salem gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain that was in 1692the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small whitefanged furry thing which scuttled out of keziahs cell and not even cotton mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red sticky fluidpossibly gilman ought not to have studied so hard noneuclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain and when one mixes them with folklore and tries to trace a strange background of multidimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimneycorner one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension gilman came from haverhill but it was only after he had entered college in arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points moreover they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library but all these precautions came late in the day so that gilman had some terrible hints from the dreadednecronomiconof abdul alhazred the fragmentarybook of eibonand the suppressedunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknownhe knew his room was in the old witch housethat indeed was why he had taken it there was much in the essex county records about keziah masons trial and what she had admitted under pressure to the court of oyer and terminer had fascinated gilman beyond all reason she had told judge hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond meadow hill and on the unpeopled island in the river she had spoken also of the black man of her oath and of her new secret name of nahab then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanishedgilman believed strange things about keziah and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than 235 years when he heard the hushed arkham whispers about keziahs persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets about the irregular human toothmarks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses about the childish cries heard near mayeve and hallowmass about the stench often noted in the old houses attic just after those dreaded seasons and about the small furry sharptoothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn he resolved to live in the place at any cost a room was easy to secure for the house was unpopular hard to rent and long given over to cheap lodgings gilman could not have told what he expected to find there but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of planck heisenberg einstein and de sitterhe studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where keziah was held to have practiced her spells it had been vacant from the firstfor no one had ever been willing to stay there longbut the polish landlord had grown wary about renting it yet nothing whatever happened to gilman till about the time of the fever no ghostly keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him and no record of the witchs incantations rewarded his constant search sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved mustysmelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow smallpaned windows here he knew strange things had happened once and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might notat least in the darkest narrowest and most intricately crooked alleyshave utterly perished he also rowed out twice to the illregarded island in the river and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the mossgrown rows of grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorialgilmans room was of good size but queerly irregular shape the north wall slanting perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end while the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction aside from an obvious rathole and the signs of other stoppedup ones there was no accessnor any appearance of a former avenue of accessto the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the houses north side though a view from the exterior shewed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote date the loft above the ceilingwhich must have had a slanting floorwas likewise inaccessible when gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry no amount of persuasion however could induce the stolid landlord to let him investigate either of these two closed spacesas time wore along his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose old keziah he reflected might have had excellent reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know his interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already onthe touch of brainfever and the dreams began early in february for some time apparently the curious angles of gilmans room had been having a strange almost hypnotic effect on him and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the downslanting ceiling met the inwardslanting wall about this period his inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably his apprehensions about the midyear examinations being very acute but the exaggerated sense of hearing was scarcely less annoying life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony and there was that constant terrifying impression ofothersoundsperhaps from regions beyond lifetrembling on the very brink of audibility so far as concrete noises went the rats in the ancient partitions were the worst sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate when it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry rattlingand when it came from the centuryclosed loft above the slanting ceiling gilman always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him utterlythe dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity and gilman felt that they must be a result jointly of his studies in mathematics and in folklore he had been thinking too much about the vague regions which his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know and about the possibility that old keziah masonguided by some influence past all conjecturehad actually found the gate to those regions the yellowed county records containing her testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human experienceand the descriptions of the darting little furry object which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible detailsthat objectno larger than a goodsized rat and quaintly called by the townspeople brown jenkinseemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic herddelusion for in 1692 no less than eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it there were recent rumours too with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat but that its sharptoothed bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like tiny human hands it took messages betwixt old keziah and the devil and was nursed on the witchs bloodwhich it sucked like a vampire its voice was a kind of loathsome titter and it could speak all languages of all the bizarre monstrosities in gilmans dreams nothing filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and diminutive hybrid whose image flitted across his vision in a form a thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking mind had deduced from the ancient records and the modern whispersgilmans dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound abysses whose material and gravitational properties and whose relation to his own entity he could not even begin to explain he did not walk or climb fly or swim crawl or wriggle yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary of his own condition he could not well judge for sight of his arms legs and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective but he felt that his physical organisation and faculties were somehow marvellously transmuted and obliquely projectedthough not without a certain grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and propertiesthe abysses were by no means vacant being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alienhued substance some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic a few of the organic objects tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind though he could form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested in the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared to be divided and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of conductpattern and basic motivation of these categories one seemed to him to include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other categoriesall the objectsorganic and inorganic alikewere totally beyond description or even comprehension gilman sometimes compared the inorganic masses to prisms labyrinths clusters of cubes and planes and cyclopean buildings and the organic things struck him variously as groups of bubbles octopi centipedes living hindoo idols and intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him he felt a stark hideous fright which generally jolted him awake of how the organic entities moved he could tell no more than of how he moved himself in time he observed a further mysterythe tendency of certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space or to disappear totally with equal suddenness the shrieking roaring confusion of sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch timbre or rhythm but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual changes in all the indefinite objects organic and inorganic alike gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure relentlessly inevitable fluctuationsbut it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin that shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the fullest depths of sleep he would be lying in the dark fighting to keep awake when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the centuried room shewing in a violet mist the convergence of angled planes which had seized his brain so insidiously the horror would appear to pop out of the rathole in the corner and patter toward him over the sagging wideplanked floor with evil expectancy in its tiny bearded human facebut mercifully this dream always melted away before the object got close enough to nuzzle him it had hellishly long sharp canine teeth gilman tried to stop up the rathole every day but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction whatever it might be once he had the landlord nail tin over it but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh holein making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bonegilman did not report his fever to the doctor for he knew he could not pass the examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every moment was needed for cramming as it was he failed in calculus d and advanced general psychology though not without hope of making up lost ground before the end of the term it was in march when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary dreaming and the nightmare shape of brown jenkin began to be companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old woman this addition disturbed him more than he could account for but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves on those occasions the evil sardonic and seemingly unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost shiveringespecially the first time when an overgrown rat darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think irrationally of brown jenkin now he reflected those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreamsthat the influence of the old house was unwholesome he could not deny but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there he argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly phantasies and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous visions those visions however were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered he was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both brown jenkin and the old woman and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of greater potencytoward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics though other studies bothered him increasingly he was getting an intuitive knack for solving riemannian equations and astonished professor upham by his comprehension of fourthdimensional and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the transgalactic gulfs themselvesor even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian spacetime continuum gilmans handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity what made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that a man mightgiven mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human acquirementstep deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic patternsuch a step he said would require only two stages first a passage out of the threedimensional sphere we know and second a passage back to the threedimensional sphere at another point perhaps one of infinite remoteness that this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable any being from any part of threedimensional space could probably survive in the fourth dimension and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part of threedimensional space it might select for its reentry denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain otherseven planets belonging to other galaxies or to similardimensional phases of other spacetime continuathough of course there must be vast numbers of mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or zones of spaceit was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensionsbe they within or outside the given spacetime continuumand that the converse would be likewise true this was a matter for speculation though one could be fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next higher plane would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquityhuman or prehumanwhose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than oursaround the first of april gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate he was also troubled by what some of his fellowlodgers said about his sleepwalking it seemed that he was often absent from his bed and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the room below this fellow also spoke of hearing the tread of shod feet in the night but gilman was sure he must have been mistaken in this since shoes as well as other apparel were always precisely in place in the morning one could develop all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old housefor did not gilman himself even in daylight now feel certain that noises other than ratscratchings came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling his pathologically sensitive ears began to listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead and sometimes the illusion of such things was agonisingly realistichowever he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist for twice at night his room had been found vacant though with all his clothing in place of this he had been assured by frank elwood the one fellowstudent whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house elwood had been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on a differential equation only to find gilman absent it had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response but he had needed the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle prodding awake on neither occasion though had gilman been thereand when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering barefoot and with only his nightclothes on he resolved to investigate the matter if reports of his sleepwalking continued and thought of sprinkling flour on the floor of the corridor to see where his footsteps might lead the door was the only conceivable egress for there was no possible foothold outside the narrow windowas april advanced gilmans feversharpened ears were disturbed by the whining prayers of a superstitious loomfixer named joe mazurewicz who had a room on the ground floor mazurewicz had told long rambling stories about the ghost of old keziah and the furry sharpfanged nuzzling thing and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifixgiven him for the purpose by father iwanicki of st stanislaus churchcould bring him relief now he was praying because the witches sabbath was drawing near mayeve was walpurgisnight when hells blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds it was always a very bad time in arkham even though the fine folks up in miskatonic avenue and high and saltonstall streets pretended to know nothing about it there would be bad doingsand a child or two would probably be missing joe knew about such things for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her grandmother it was wise to pray and count ones beads at this season for three months keziah and brown jenkin had not been near joes room nor near paul choynskis room nor anywhere elseand it meant no good when they held off like that they must be up to somethinggilman dropped in at a doctors office on the 16th of the month and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared the physician questioned him sharply and advised him to see a nerve specialist on reflection he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor old waldron who had curtailed his activities before would have made him take a restan impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations he was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the fourth dimension and who could say how much farther he might gobut even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange confidence did all of this perilous sense of imminence come from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day the soft stealthy imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving and now too there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do how about the somnambulism where did he go sometimes in the night and what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while seemed to trickle through the maddening confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad daylight and full wakefulness its rhythm did not correspond to anything on earth unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two unmentionable sabbatchants and sometimes he feared it corresponded to certain attributes of the vague shrieking or roaring in those wholly alien abysses of dreamthe dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious in the lighter preliminary phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness and gilman knew she was the one who had frightened him in the slums her bent back long nose and shrivelled chin were unmistakable and her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered the expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened he must meet the black man and go with them all to the throne of azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos that was what she said he must sign in his own blood the book of azathoth and take a new secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far what kept him from going with her and brown jenkin and the other to the throne of chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name azathoth in thenecronomiconand knew it stood for a primal evil too horrible for descriptionthe old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant she seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted brown jenkin too was always a little nearer at the last and its yellowishwhite fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet phosphorescence its shrill loathsome tittering stuck more and more in gilmans head and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced the words azathoth and nyarlathotepin the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of lifeforms from our own planet including human beings what the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think two of the less irrelevantly moving thingsa rather large congeries of iridescent prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface anglesseemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms labyrinths cubeandplane clusters and quasibuildings and all the while the vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder as if approaching some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensityduring the night of april 1920 the new development occurred gilman was halfinvoluntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubblemass and the small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prismclusters in another second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense diffused green light he was barefooted and in his nightclothes and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet a swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapourthen he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward himthe old woman and the little furry thing the crone strained up to her knees and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion while brown jenkin pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid fore paw which it raised with evident difficulty spurred by an impulse he did not originate gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by the angle of the old womans arms and the direction of the small monstrositys paw and before he had shuffled three steps he was back in the twilight abysses geometrical shapes seethed around him and he fell dizzily and interminably at last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old househe was good for nothing that morning and stayed away from all his classes some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant direction for he could not help staring at a certain vacant spot on the floor as the day advanced the focus of his unseeing eyes changed position and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy about two oclock he went out for lunch and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the southeast only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more stronglyhe would have to consult a nerve specialist after allperhaps there was a connexion with his somnambulismbut meanwhile he might at least try to break the morbid spell himself undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away from the pull so with great resolution he headed against it and dragged himself deliberately north along garrison street by the time he had reached the bridge over the miskatonic he was in a cold perspiration and he clutched at the iron railing as he gazed upstream at the illregarded island whose regular lines of ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlightthen he gave a start for there was a clearly visible living figure on that desolate island and a second glance told him it was certainly the strange old woman whose sinister aspect had worked itself so disastrously into his dreams the tall grass near her was moving too as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground when the old woman began to turn toward him he fled precipitately off the bridge and into the shelter of the towns labyrinthine waterfront alleys distant though the island was he felt that a monstrous and invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent ancient figure in brownthe southeastward pull still held and only with tremendous resolution could gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs for hours he sat silent and aimless with his eyes shifting gradually westward about six oclock his sharpened ears caught the whining prayers of joe mazurewicz two floors below and in desperation he seized his hat and walked out into the sunsetgolden streets letting the now directly southward pull carry him where it might an hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond hangmans brook with the glimmering spring stars shining ahead the urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to leap mystically into space and suddenly he realised just where the source of the pull layit was in the sky a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn in the morning it had been underfoot afternoon found it rising in the southeast and now it was roughly south but wheeling toward the west what was the meaning of this new thing was he going mad how long would it last again mustering his resolution gilman turned and dragged himself back to the sinister old housemazurewicz was waiting for him at the door and seemed both anxious and reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition it was about the witch light joe had been out celebrating the night beforeit was patriots day in massachusettsand had come home after midnight looking up at the house from outside he had thought at first that gilmans window was dark but then he had seen the faint violet glow within he wanted to warn the gentleman about that glow for everybody in arkham knew it was keziahs witch light which played near brown jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself he had not mentioned this before but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her longtoothed familiar were haunting the young gentleman sometimes he and paul choynski and landlord dombrowski thought they saw that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young gentlemans room but they had all agreed not to talk about that however it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like father iwanickias the man rambled on gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat he knew that joe must have been half drunk when he came home the night before yet this mention of a violet light in the garret window was of frightful import it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the dreamluminance was utterly beyond sane harbourage yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion had he himself talked as well as walked around the house in his sleep no joe said he had notbut he must check up on this perhaps frank elwood could tell him something though he hated to askfeverwild dreamssomnambulismillusions of soundsa pull toward a point in the skyand now a suspicion of insane sleeptalking he must stop studying see a nerve specialist and take himself in hand when he climbed to the second story he paused at elwoods door but saw that the other youth was out reluctantly he continued up to his garret room and sat down in the dark his gaze was still pulled to the southwest but he also found himself listening intently for some sound in the closed loft above and half imagining that an evil violet light seeped down through an infinitesimal crack in the low slanting ceilingthat night as gilman slept the violet light broke upon him with heightened intensity and the old witch and small furry thinggetting closer than ever beforemocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish gestures he was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight abysses though the pursuit of that iridescent bubblecongeries and that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and irritating then came the shift as vast converging planes of a slipperylooking substance loomed above and below hima shift which ended in a flash of delirium and a blaze of unknown alien light in which yellow carmine and indigo were madly and inextricably blendedhe was half lying on a high fantastically balustraded terrace above a boundless jungle of outlandish incredible peaks balanced planes domes minarets horizontal discs poised on pinnacles and numberless forms of still greater wildnesssome of stone and some of metalwhich glittered gorgeously in the mixed almost blistering glare from a polychromatic sky looking upward he saw three stupendous discs of flame each of a different hue and at a different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains behind him tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see the city below stretched away to the limits of vision and he hoped that no sound would well up from itthe pavement from which he easily raised himself was of a veined polished stone beyond his power to identify and the tiles were cut in bizarreangled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend the balustrade was chesthigh delicate and fantastically wrought while along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship they like the whole balustrade seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose colour could not be guessed in this chaos of mixed effulgences and their nature utterly defied conjecture they represented some ridged barrelshaped object with thin horizontal arms radiating spokelike from a central ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the head and base of the barrel each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long flat triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfishnearly horizontal but curving slightly away from the central barrel the base of the bottom knob was fused to the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been broken off and were missing the figures were about four and a half inches in height while the spiky arms gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a half incheswhen gilman stood up the tiles felt hot to his bare feet he was wholly alone and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place the sight turned him giddy after a while so that he would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous balustrade his right hand fell on one of the projecting figures the touch seeming to steady him slightly it was too much however for the exotic delicacy of the metalwork and the spiky figure snapped off under his grasp still halfdazed he continued to clutch it as his other hand seized a vacant space on the smooth railingbut now his oversensitive ears caught something behind him and he looked back across the level terrace approaching him softly though without apparent furtiveness were five figures two of which were the sinister old woman and the fanged furry little animal the other three were what sent him unconsciousfor they were living entities about eight feet high shaped precisely like the spiky images on the balustrade and propelling themselves by a spiderlike wriggling of their lower set of starfisharmsgilman awakened in his bed drenched by a cold perspiration and with a smarting sensation in his face hands and feet springing to the floor he washed and dressed in frantic haste as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible he did not know where he wished to go but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes the odd pull toward that spot in the sky between hydra and argo had abated but another of even greater strength had taken its place now he felt that he must go northinfinitely north he dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the miskatonic so went over the peabody avenue bridge very often he stumbled for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty point in the blank blue skyafter about an hour he got himself under better control and saw that he was far from the city all around him stretched the bleak emptiness of salt marshes while the narrow road ahead led to innsmouththat ancient halfdeserted town which arkham people were so curiously unwilling to visit though the northward pull had not diminished he resisted it as he had resisted the other pull and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other plodding back to town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain he dragged himself into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter magazines once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he looked but he did not tell them of his walk at three oclock he took some lunch at a restaurant noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself after that he killed the time at a cheap cinema show seeing the inane performance over and over again without paying any attention to itabout nine at night he drifted homeward and stumbled into the ancient house joe mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers and gilman hastened up to his own garret chamber without pausing to see if elwood was in it was when he turned on the feeble electric light that the shock came at once he saw there was something on the table which did not belong there and a second look left no room for doubt lying on its sidefor it could not stand up alonewas the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade no detail was missing the ridged barrelshaped centre the thin radiating arms the knobs at each end and the flat slightly outwardcurving starfisharms spreading from those knobsall were there in the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of iridescent grey veined with green and gilman could see amidst his horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dreamrailingonly his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear still dazed he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to landlord dombrowskis quarters the whining prayers of the superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls but gilman did not mind them now the landlord was in and greeted him pleasantly no he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it but his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon and maybe that was it dombrowski called her and she waddled in yes that was the thing she had found it in the young gentlemans bedon the side next the wall it had looked very queer to her but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his roombooks and curios and pictures and markings on paper she certainly knew nothing about itso gilman climbed upstairs again in a mental turmoil convinced that he was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places where had he got this outr thing he did not recall seeing it in any museum in arkham it must have been somewhere though and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd dreampicture of the balustraded terrace next day he would make some very guarded inquiriesand perhaps see the nerve specialistmeanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism as he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowedwith a frank admission as to its purposefrom the landlord he had stopped at elwoods door on the way but had found all dark within entering his room he placed the spiky thing on the table and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress from the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding but he was too disorganised even to mind it that cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the skyin the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion this time they actually reached him and he felt the crones withered claws clutching at him he was pulled out of bed and into empty space and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw the twilight amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him but that moment was very brief for presently he was in a crude windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a peak just above his head and with a curious slanting floor underfoot propped level on that floor were low cases full of books of every degree of antiquity and disintegration and in the centre were a table and bench both apparently fastened in place small objects of unknown shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases and in the flaming violet light gilman thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky image which had puzzled him so horribly on the left the floor fell abruptly away leaving a black triangular gulf out of which after a seconds dry rattling there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human facethe evilly grinning beldame still clutched him and beyond the table stood a figure he had never seen beforea tall lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features wholly devoid of either hair or beard and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench but he must have been shod since there was a clicking whenever he changed position the man did not speak and bore no trace of expression on his small regular features he merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into gilmans right hand over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamers clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff as the blood spurted from this wound gilman lapsed into a fainthe awaked on the morning of the 22nd with a pain in his left wrist and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood his recollections were very confused but the scene with the black man in the unknown space stood out vividly the rats must have bitten him as he slept giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream opening the door he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the other end of the garret so he had not been sleepwalking this time but something would have to be done about those rats he would speak to the landlord about them again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size his ears were ringing horribly as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreamsas he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in the violetlitten space but nothing definite would crystallise in his mind that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead which had begun to attack his imagination so violently but later impressions were faint and hazy there were suggestions of the vague twilight abysses and of still vaster blacker abysses beyond themabysses in which all fixed suggestions of form were absent he had been taken there by the bubblecongeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him but they like himself had changed to wisps of milky barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness something else had gone on aheada larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of formand he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos eventually there had been a hint of vast leaping shadows of a monstrous halfacoustic pulsing and of the thin monotonous piping of an unseen flutebut that was all gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in thenecronomiconabout the mindless entity azathoth which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of chaoswhen the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight and gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures it occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lainwhich was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff had he been sleepwalking within his room and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position he looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains but did not find any he had better he thought sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the doorthough after all no further proof of his sleepwalking was needed he knew he did walkand the thing to do now was to stop it he must ask frank elwood for help this morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable it was a vague insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly as he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger but even so it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urgehe took the spiky image down to elwoods room steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor elwood was in thank heaven and appeared to be stirring about there was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college so gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears his host was very sympathetic and agreed that something ought to be done he was shocked by his guests drawn haggard aspect and noticed the queer abnormallooking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week there was not much though that he could say he had not seen gilman on any sleepwalking expedition and had no idea what the curious image could be he had though heard the frenchcanadian who lodged just under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening they were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of walpurgisnight now only a few days off and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor doomed young gentleman desrochers the fellow under gilmans room had spoken of nocturnal footsteps both shod and unshod and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through gilmans keyhole he had not dared to peer he told mazurewicz after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door there had been soft talking tooand as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisperelwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping but supposed their imaginations had been roused by gilmans late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand and by the nearness of traditionally feared mayeve on the other hand that gilman talked in his sleep was plain and it was obviously from desrochers keyholelistenings that the delusive notion of the violet dreamlight had got abroad these simple people were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about as for a plan of actiongilman had better move down to elwoods room and avoid sleeping alone elwood would if awake rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep very soon too he must see the specialist meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain professors seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public rubbishcan also dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the wallsbraced up by elwoods companionship gilman attended classes that day strange urges still tugged at him but he could sidetrack them with considerable success during a free period he shewed the queer image to several professors all of whom were intensely interested though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin that night he slept on a couch which elwood had had the landlord bring to the secondstory room and for the first time in weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams but the feverishness still hung on and the whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influenceduring the next few days gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations he had elwood said shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep and meanwhile the landlord was putting ratpoison everywhere the only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners whose imaginations had become highly excited mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix and finally forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good father iwanicki desrochers too had something to sayin fact he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of gilmans absence from it paul choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night and claimed that his door had been softly tried while mrs dombrowski vowed she had seen brown jenkin for the first time since allhallows but such naive reports could mean very little and gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his hosts dresserfor three days gilman and elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image but always without success in every quarter however interest was intense for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity one of the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical analysis and the result is still talked about in college circles professor ellery found platinum iron and tellurium in the strange alloy but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify not only did they fail to correspond with any known element but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for probable elements in the periodic system the mystery remains unsolved to this day though the image is on exhibition at the museum of miskatonic universityon the morning of april 27 a fresh rathole appeared in the room where gilman was a guest but dombrowski tinned it up during the day the poison was not having much effect for scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished elwood was out late that night and gilman waited up for him he did not wish to go to sleep in a room aloneespecially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams he wondered who she was and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a rubbishheap at the mouth of a squalid courtyard the crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at himthough perhaps this was merely his imaginationthe next day both youths felt very tired and knew they would sleep like logs when night came in the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed gilman and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable they spoke of old keziah mason and elwood agreed that gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant information the hidden cults to which these witches belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder forgotten aeons and it was by no means impossible that keziah had actually mastered the art of passing through dimensional gates tradition emphasises the uselessness of material barriers in halting a witchs motions and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the nightwhether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical research alone was still to be seen success gilman added might lead to dangerous and unthinkable situations for who could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally inaccessible dimension on the other hand the picturesque possibilities were enormous time could not exist in certain belts of space and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve ones life and age indefinitely never suffering organic metabolism or deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to ones own or similar planes one might for example pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earths history as young as beforewhether anybody had ever managed to do this one could hardly conjecture with any degree of authority old legends are hazy and ambiguous and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and messengers from outside there was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powersthe black man of the witchcult and the nyarlathotep of thenecronomiconthere was too the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediariesthe quasianimals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches familiars as gilman and elwood retired too sleepy to argue further they heard joe mazurewicz reel into the house halfdrunk and shuddered at the desperate wildness of his whining prayersthat night gilman saw the violet light again in his dream he had heard a scratching and gnawing in the partitions and thought that someone fumbled clumsily at the latch then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor the beldames face was alight with inhuman exultation and the little yellowtoothed morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavily sleeping form of elwood on the other couch across the room a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out as once before the hideous crone seized gilman by the shoulders yanking him out of bed and into empty space again the infinitude of the shrieking twilight abysses flashed past him but in another second he thought he was in a dark muddy unknown alley of foetid odours with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on every handahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man which the deep mud largely concealed there was a dark open doorway on the right to which the black man silently pointed into this the grimacing crone started dragging gilman after her by his pajama sleeve there were evilsmelling staircases which creaked ominously and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light and finally a door leading off a landing the crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the door open motioning to gilman to wait and disappearing inside the black aperturethe youths oversensitive ears caught a hideous strangled cry and presently the beldame came out of the room bearing a small senseless form which she thrust at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it the sight of this form and the expression on its face broke the spell still too dazed to cry out he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man as consciousness departed he heard the faint shrill tittering of the fanged ratlike abnormalityon the morning of the 29th gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror the instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall and ceiling sprawled on the now unmade bed his throat was aching inexplicably and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajamabottoms were brown with caked mud for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy but he knew at least that he must have been sleepwalking elwood had been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him on the floor were confused muddy prints but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door the more gilman looked at them the more peculiar they seemed for in addition to those he could recognise as his there were some smaller almost round markingssuch as the legs of a large chair or table might make except that most of them tended to be divided into halves there were also some curious muddy rattracks leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again utter bewilderment and the fear of madness racked gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were no muddy prints outside the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors belowdescending to elwoods room he roused his stillsleeping host and began telling of how he had found himself but elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened where gilman could have been how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall and how the muddy furniturelike prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber were wholly beyond conjecture then there were those dark livid marks on his throat as if he had tried to strangle himself he put his hands up to them but found that they did not even approximately fit while they were talking desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours no there had been no one on the stairs after midnightthough just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret and cautiously descending steps he did not like it was he added a very bad time of year for arkham the young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him even the daytime was not safe for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the houseespecially a thin childish wail hastily choked offgilman mechanically attended classes that morning but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies a mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had seized him and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow at noon he lunched at the university spa picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert but he never ate that dessert for an item on the papers first page left him limp wildeyed and able only to pay his check and stagger back to elwoods roomthere had been a strange kidnapping the night before in ornes gangway and the twoyearold child of a clodlike laundry worker named anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight the mother it appeared had feared the event for some time but the reasons she assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them seriously she had she said seen brown jenkin about the place now and then ever since early in march and knew from its grimaces and titterings that little ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the awful sabbat on walpurgisnight she had asked her neighbour mary czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child but mary had not dared she could not tell the police for they never believed such things children had been taken that way every year ever since she could remember and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way anyhowbut what threw gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after midnight they admitted they had been drunk but both vowed they had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway there had they said been a huge robed negro a little old woman in rags and a young white man in his nightclothes the old woman had been dragging the youth while around the feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mudgilman sat in a daze all the afternoon and elwoodwho had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from themfound him thus when he came home this time neither could doubt but that something hideously serious was closing in around them between the phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallising and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments gilman must see a specialist sooner or later but not just now when all the papers were full of this kidnapping businessjust what had really happened was maddeningly obscure and for a moment both gilman and elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest kind had gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his studies of space and its dimensions had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable whereif anywherehad he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage the roaring twilight abyssesthe green hillsidethe blistering terracethe pulls from the starsthe ultimate black vortexthe black manthe muddy alley and the stairsthe old witch and the fanged furry horrorthe bubblecongeries and the little polyhedronthe strange sunburnthe wrist woundthe unexplained imagethe muddy feetthe throatmarksthe tales and fears of the superstitious foreignerswhat did all this mean to what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a casethere was no sleep for either of them that night but next day they both cut classes and drowsed this was april 30th and with the dusk would come the hellish sabbattime which all the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared mazurewicz came home at six oclock and said people at the mill were whispering that the walpurgisrevels would be held in the dark ravine beyond meadow hill where the old white stone stands in a place queerly void of all plantlife some of them had even told the police and advised them to look there for the missing wolejko child but they did not believe anything would be done joe insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his nickelchained crucifix and gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to humour the fellowlate at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs lulled by the rhythmical praying of the loomfixer on the floor below gilman listened as he nodded his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for some subtle dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house unwholesome recollections of things in thenecronomiconand the black book welled up and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehendpresently he realised what he was listening forthe hellish chant of the celebrants in the distant black valley how did he know so much about what they expected how did he know the time when nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black goat he saw that elwood had dropped asleep and tried to call out and waken him something however closed his throat he was not his own master had he signed the black mans book after allthen his fevered abnormal hearing caught the distant windborne notes over miles of hill and field and alley they came but he recognised them none the less the fires must be lit and the dancers must be starting in how could he keep himself from going what was it that had enmeshed him mathematicsfolklorethe houseold keziahbrown jenkin and now he saw that there was a fresh rathole in the wall near his couch above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of joe mazurewicz came another sounda stealthy determined scratching in the partitions he hoped the electric lights would not go out then he saw the fanged bearded little face in the ratholethe accursed little face which he at last realised bore such a shocking mocking resemblance to old keziahsand heard the faint fumbling at the doorthe screaming twilight abysses flashed before him and he felt himself helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubblecongeries ahead raced the small kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax he seemed to know what was comingthe monstrous burst of walpurgisrhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal ultimate spacetime seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periodsbut all this vanished in a second he was again in the cramped violetlitten peaked space with the slanting floor the low cases of ancient books the bench and table the queer objects and the triangular gulf at one side on the table lay a small white figurean infant boy unclothed and unconsciouswhile on the other side stood the monstrous leering old woman with a gleaming grotesquehafted knife in her right hand and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her left she was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which gilman could not understand but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in thenecronomiconas the scene grew clear he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the empty bowl across the tableand unable to control his own motions he reached far forward and took it in both hands noticing as he did so its comparative lightness at the same moment the disgusting form of brown jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left the crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach the fanged furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual while the witch croaked loathsome responses gilman felt a gnawing poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp a second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely and he dropped the bowl with a resounding belllike clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deedin an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the knife from the old womans claws sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf in another instant however matters were reversed for those murderous claws had locked themselves tightly around his own throat while the wrinkled face was twisted with insane fury he felt the chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck and in his peril wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature her strength was altogether superhuman but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol snapping the chain and pulling it freeat sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic and her grip relaxed long enough to give gilman a chance to break it entirely he pulled the steellike claws from his neck and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again this time he resolved to reply in kind and his own hands reached out for the creatures throat before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix twisted about her neck and a moment later he had tightened it enough to cut off her breath during her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle and saw that brown jenkin had come to her aid with one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far belowwhether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know but he let her rest on the floor where she had fallen then as he turned away he saw on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his reason brown jenkin tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity had been busy while the witch was throttling him and his efforts had been in vain what he had prevented the knife from doing to the victims chest the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy had done to a wristand the bowl so lately on the floor stood full beside the small lifeless bodyin his dreamdelirium gilman heard the hellish alienrhythmed chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance and knew the black man must be there confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics and he believed his subconscious mind held theangleswhich he needed to guide him back to the normal worldalone and unaided for the first time he felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own room but whether he could ever escape through the slanting floor or the longstopped egress he doubted greatly besides would not an escape from a dreamloft bring him merely into a dreamhousean abnormal projection of the actual place he sought he was wholly bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiencesthe passage through the vague abysses would be frightful for the walpurgisrhythm would be vibrating and at last he would have to hear that hitherto veiled cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded even now he could detect a low monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well at sabbattime it always mounted and reached through to the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites half the chants of the sabbat were patterned on this faintly overheard pulsing which no earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness gilman wondered too whether he could trust his instinct to take him back to the right part of space how could he be sure he would not land on that greenlitten hillside of a far planet on the tessellated terrace above the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of chaos wherein reigns the mindless daemonsultan azathothjust before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness the witchold keziahnahabthat must have meant her death and mixed with the distant chant of the sabbat and the whimpers of brown jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard another and wilder whine from unknown depths joe mazurewiczthe prayers against the crawling chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant shriekworlds of sardonic actuality impinging on vortices of febrile dreami shubniggurath the goat with a thousand young they found gilman on the floor of his queerly angled old garret room long before dawn for the terrible cry had brought desrochers and choynski and dombrowski and mazurewicz at once and had even wakened the soundly sleeping elwood in his chair he was alive and with open staring eyes but seemed largely unconscious on his throat were the marks of murderous hands and on his left ankle was a distressing ratbite his clothing was badly rumpled and joes crucifix was missing elwood trembled afraid even to speculate on what new form his friends sleepwalking had taken mazurewicz seemed halfdazed because of a sign he said he had had in response to his prayers and he crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from beyond the slanting partitionwhen the dreamer was settled on his couch in elwoods room they sent for dr malkowskia local practitioner who would repeat no tales where they might prove embarrassingand he gave gilman two hypodermic injections which caused him to relax in something like natural drowsiness during the day the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to elwood it was a painful process and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting factgilmanwhose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitivenesswas now stone deaf dr malkowski summoned again in haste told elwood that both eardrums were ruptured as if by the impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception or endurance how such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours without arousing all the miskatonic valley was more than the honest physician could sayelwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper so that a fairly easy communication was maintained neither knew what to make of the whole chaotic business and decided it would be better if they thought as little as possible about it both though agreed that they must leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged evening papers spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a ravine beyond meadow hill just before dawn and mentioned that the white stone there was an object of agelong superstitious regard nobody had been caught but among the scattering fugitives had been glimpsed a huge negro in another column it was stated that no trace of the missing child ladislas wolejko had been foundthe crowning horror came that very night elwood will never forget it and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous breakdown he had thought he heard rats in the partitions all the evening but paid little attention to them then long after both he and gilman had retired the atrocious shrieking began elwood jumped up turned on the lights and rushed over to his guests couch the occupant was emitting sounds of veritably inhuman nature as if racked by some torment beyond description he was writhing under the bedclothes and a great red stain was beginning to appear on the blanketselwood scarcely dared to touch him but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided by this time dombrowski choynski desrochers mazurewicz and the topfloor lodger were all crowding into the doorway and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for dr malkowski everybody shrieked when a large ratlike form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh open hole close by when the doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers walter gilman was deadit would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed gilman there had been virtually a tunnel through his bodysomething had eaten his heart out dombrowski frantic at the failure of his constant ratpoisoning efforts cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in walnut street the worst thing for a while was keeping joe mazurewicz quiet for the brooding loomfixer would never stay sober and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible thingsit seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson rattracks which led from gilmans couch to the nearby hole on the carpet they were very indistinct but a piece of open flooring intervened between the carpets edge and the baseboard there mazurewicz had found something monstrousor thought he had for no one else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the prints the tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the average prints of a rat but even choynski and desrochers would not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human handsthe house was never rented again as soon as dombrowski left it the pall of its final desolation began to descend for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid odour perhaps the exlandlords ratpoison had worked after all for not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside the eastern garret room and agreed that the number of dead rats must be enormous they decided however that it was not worth their while to hew open and disinfect the longsealed spaces for the foetor would soon be over and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards indeed there were always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in the witch house just after mayeve and hallowmass the neighbours grumblingly acquiesced in the inertiabut the foetor none the less formed an additional count against the place toward the last the house was condemned as an habitation by the building inspectorgilmans dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been explained elwood whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening came back to college the next autumn and graduated in the following june he found the spectral gossip of the town much diminished and it is indeed a fact thatnotwithstanding certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itselfno fresh appearances either of old keziah or of brown jenkin have been muttered of since gilmans death it is rather fortunate that elwood was not in arkham in that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors of course he heard about the matter afterward and suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation but even that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights would have beenin march 1931 a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant witch house so that a chaos of crumbling bricks blackened mossgrown shingles and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the floor beneath the whole attic story was choked with debris from above but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure that ultimate step came in the following december and it was when gilmans old room was cleared out by reluctant apprehensive workmen that the gossip beganamong the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in the police later the police in turn called in the coroner and several professors from the university there were bonesbadly crushed and splintered but clearly recognisable as humanwhose manifestly modern date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only possible lurkingplace the low slantfloored loft overhead had supposedly been sealed from all human access the coroners physician decided that some belonged to a small child while certain othersfound mixed with shreds of rotten brownish clothbelonged to a rather undersized bent female of advanced years careful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse as well as older ratbones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of controversy and reflectionother objects found included the mingled fragments of many books and papers together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers all without exception appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones an even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed archaic writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of at least 150 to 200 years to some though the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objectsobjects whose shapes materials types of workmanship and purposes baffle all conjecturefound scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury one of these thingswhich excited several miskatonic professors profoundlyis a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which gilman gave to the college museum save that it is larger wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphicsarchaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by joe mazurewicz as that which he had given poor gilman many years before some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of gilmans old room all the time still others including joe himself have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credencewhen the slanting wall of gilmans room was torn out the once sealed triangular space between that partition and the houses north wall was found to contain much less structural debris even in proportion to its size than the room itself though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror in brief the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small childrensome fairly modern but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete on this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size obvious antiquity and grotesque ornate and exotic designabove which the debris was piledin the midst of this debris wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney was an object destined to cause more bafflement veiled fright and openly superstitious talk in arkham than anything else discovered in the haunted and accursed building this object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence among the members of miskatonics department of comparative anatomy very little concerning this skeleton has leaked out but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the long brownish hairs with which it was associatedthe bones of the tiny paws it is rumoured imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness appearing from certain angles like a miniature monstrously degraded parody of a human skull the workmen crossed themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy but later burned candles of gratitude in st stanislaus church because of the shrill ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again,1

massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the aylesbury pike just beyond deans corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country the ground gets higher and the brierbordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty curving road the trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large and the wild weeds brambles and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions at the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age squalor and dilapidation without knowing why one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping rockstrown meadows those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things with which it would be better to have nothing to do when a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased the summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crownedgorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety when the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs the thin shining line of the miskatonics upper reaches has an oddly serpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it risesas the hills draw nearer one heeds their wooded sides more than their stonecrowned tops those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance but there is no road by which to escape them across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region it is not reassuring to see on a closer glance that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin and that the brokensteepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge yet there is no way to avoid it once across it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint malign odour about the village street as of the massed mould and decay of centuries it is always a relief to get clear of the place and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwichoutsiders visit dunwich as seldom as possible and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down the scenery judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon is more than commonly beautiful yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists two centuries ago when talk of witchblood satanworship and strange forest presences was not laughed at it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality in our sensible agesince the dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the towns and the worlds welfare at heartpeople shun it without knowing exactly why perhaps one reasonthough it cannot apply to uninformed strangersis that the natives are now repellently decadent having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many new england backwaters they have come to form a race by themselves with the welldefined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding the average of their intelligence is woefully low whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of halfhidden murders incests and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity the old gentry representing the two or three armigerous families which came from salem in 1692 have kept somewhat above the general level of decay though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace some of the whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to harvard and miskatonic though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were bornno one even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror can say just what is the matter with dunwich though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the indians amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below in 1747 the reverend abijah hoadley newly come to the congregational church at dunwich village preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of satan and his imps in which he saidit must be allowd that these blasphemies of an infernall train of daemons are matters of too common knowledge to be denyd the cursed voices ofazazelandbuzraelofbeelzebubandbelialbeing heard now from under ground by above a score of credible witnesses now living i my self did not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain discourse of evill powers in the hill behind my house wherein there were a rattling and rolling groaning screeching and hissing such as no things of this earth coud raise up and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magick can discover and only the divell unlockmr hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon but the text printed in springfield is still extant noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographersother traditions tell of foul odours near the hillcrowning circles of stone pillars and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines while still others try to explain the devils hop yarda bleak blasted hillside where no tree shrub or grassblade will grow then too the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights it is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferers struggling breath if they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter but if they fail they subside gradually into a disappointed silencethese tales of course are obsolete and ridiculous because they come down from very old times dunwich is indeed ridiculously oldolder by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house which was built before 1700 whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls built in 1806 form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen industry did not flourish here and the nineteenthcentury factory movement proved shortlived oldest of all are the great rings of roughhewn stone columns on the hilltops but these are more generally attributed to the indians than to the settlers deposits of skulls and bones found within these circles and around the sizeable tablelike rock on sentinel hill sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burialplaces of the pocumtucks even though many ethnologists disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory persist in believing the remains caucasianiiit was in the township of dunwich in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling that wilbur whateley was born at 5 am on sunday the second of february 1913 this date was recalled because it was candlemas which people in dunwich curiously observe under another name and because the noises in the hills had sounded and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently throughout the night before less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent whateleys a somewhat deformed unattractive albino woman of thirtyfive living with an aged and halfinsane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth lavinia whateley had no known husband but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk mightand didspeculate as widely as they chose on the contrary she seemed strangely proud of the dark goatishlooking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pinkeyed albinism and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous futurelavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of whateleys and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes she had never been to school but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that old whateley had taught her the remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old whateleys reputation for black magic and the unexplained death by violence of mrs whateley when lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular isolated among strange influences lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular occupations nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappearedthere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs barking on the night wilbur was born but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward when old whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into dunwich village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at osborns general store there seemed to be a change in the old manan added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fearthough he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter and what he said of the childs paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterwardi dunt keer what folks thinkef lavinnys

day yew folksll hear a child o lavinnys acallin its fathers name on the top o sentinel hillthe only persons who saw wilbur during the first month of his life were old zechariah whateley of the undecayed whateleys and earl sawyers commonlaw wife mamie bishop mamies visit was frankly one of curiosity and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis this marked the beginning of a course of cattlebuying on the part of small wilburs family which ended only in 1928 when the dunwich horror came and went yet at no time did the ramshackle whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock there came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic bloodlesslooking specimens evidently some blight or distemper perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn caused a heavy mortality amongst the whateley animals odd wounds or sores having something of the aspect of incisions seemed to afflict the visible cattle and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey unshaven old man and his slatternly crinklyhaired albino daughterin the spring after wilburs birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child public interest in the whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit wilburs growth was indeed phenomenal for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age his motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant and no one was really unprepared when at seven months he began to walk unassisted with falterings which another month was sufficient to removeit was somewhat after this timeon halloweenthat a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill where the old tablelike stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones considerable talk was started when silas bishopof the undecayed bishopsmentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked silas was rounding up a stray heifer but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern they darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed afterward he could not be sure about the boy who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm his contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasonsthe next january gossips were mildly interested in the fact that lavinnys black brat had commenced to talk and at the age of only eleven months his speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud the boy was not talkative yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by dunwich and its denizens the strangeness did not reside in what he said or even in the simple idioms he used but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds his facial aspect too was remarkable for its maturity for though he shared his mothers and grandfathers chinlessness his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large dark almost latin eyes to give him an air of quasiadulthood and wellnigh preternatural intelligence he was however exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips largepored yellowish skin coarse crinkly hair and oddly elongated ears he was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of old whateley and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name ofyogsothothin the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him dogs abhorred the boy and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menaceiiimeanwhile old whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd he also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his housea spacious peakedroofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside and whose three leastruined groundfloor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter there must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour and though he still babbled dementedly at times his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born when one of the many toolsheds had been put suddenly in order clapboarded and fitted with a stout fresh lock now in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house he was a no less thorough craftsman his mania shewed itself only in his tight boardingup of all the windows in the reclaimed sectionthough many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandsona room which several callers saw though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story this chamber he lined with tall firm shelving along which he began gradually to arrange in apparently careful order all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various roomsi made some use of em he would say as he tried to mend a torn blackletter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove but the boys fitten to make better use of em hed orter hev em as well sot as he kin for theyre goin to be all of his larninwhen wilbur was a year and seven months oldin september of 1914his size and accomplishments were almost alarming he had grown as large as a child of four and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker he ran freely about the fields and hills and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings at home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfathers books while old whateley would instruct and catechise him through long hushed afternoons by this time the restoration of the house was finished and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door it was a window in the rear of the east gable end close against the hill and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground about the period of this works completion people noticed that the old toolhouse tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since wilburs birth had been abandoned again the door swung listlessly open and when earl sawyer once stepped within after a cattleselling call on old whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encounteredsuch a stench he averred as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the indian circles on the hills and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth but then the homes and sheds of dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculatenessthe following months were void of visible events save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises on mayeve of 1915 there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt whilst the following halloween produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flamethem witch whateleys doinsfrom the summit of sentinel hill wilbur was growing up uncannily so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year he read avidly by himself now but talked much less than formerly a settled taciturnity was absorbing him and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face he would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror the aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety his occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardiansthe few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boardedup second story she would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fishpeddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway that peddler told the store loungers at dunwich village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above the loungers reflected thinking of the door and runway and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared then they shuddered as they recalled tales of old whateleys youth and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personallyin 1917 the war came and squire sawyer whateley as chairman of the local draft board had hard work finding a quota of young dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp the government alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence sent several officers and medical experts to investigate conducting a survey which new england newspaper readers may still recall it was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the whateleys and caused theboston globeandarkham advertiserto print flamboyant sunday stories of young wilburs precociousness old whateleys black magic the shelves of strange books the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises wilbur was four and a half then and looked like a lad of fifteen his lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down and his voice had begun to breakearl sawyer went out to the whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces it was he said exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared and grinned over the obvious mistakes they wondered too why the writers made so much of the fact that old whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date the whateleys had received their visitors with illconcealed distaste though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talkivfor a decade the annals of the whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their mayeve and allhallows orgies twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse in the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside worlds attention to themselvesabout 1923 when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind voice stature and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house it was all inside the sealed upper part and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof they had torn down the great central chimney too and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipein the spring after this event old whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of cold spring glen to chirp under his window at night he seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance and told the loungers at osborns that he thought his time had almost comethey whistle jest in tune with my breathin naow he said an i guess theyre gittin ready to ketch my soul they know its agoin aout an dunt calclate to miss it yewll know boys arter im gone whether they git me er not ef they dew theyll keep up asingin an laffin till break o day ef they dunt theyll kinder quiet daown like i expeck them an the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimeson lammas night 1924 dr houghton of aylesbury was hastily summoned by wilbur whateley who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from osborns in the village he found old whateley in a very grave state with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off the shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping as of the waves on some level beach the doctor though was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man it was uncanny and unnaturaltoo much thought dr houghton like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent calltoward one oclock old whateley gained consciousness and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandsonmore space willy more space soon yew growsanthatgrows faster itll be ready to sarve ye soon boy open up the gates to yogsothoth with the long chant that yell find on page 751of the complete editionanthenput a match to the prison fire from airth cant burn it nohaowhe was obviously quite mad after a pause during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off he added another sentence or twofeed it reglar willy an mind the quantity but dunt let it grow too fast fer the place fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to yogsothoth its all over an no use only them from beyont kin make it multiply an work only them the old uns as wants to come back but speech gave place to gasps again and lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change it was the same for more than an hour when the final throaty rattle came dr houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence lavinia sobbed but wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintlythey didnt git him he muttered in his heavy bass voicewilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his onesided way and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept he was more and more hated and dreaded around dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of oldtime gold which still as in his grandfathers time went forth regularly and increasingly for cattlebuying he was now tremendously mature of aspect and his height having reached the normal adult limit seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure in 1925 when a scholarly correspondent from miskatonic university called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled he was fully six and threequarters feet tallthrough all the years wilbur had treated his halfdeformed albino mother with a growing contempt finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on mayeve and hallowmass and in 1926 the poor creature complained to mamie bishop of being afraid of himtheys more abaout him as i knows than i kin tell ye mamie she said an naowadays theys more nor what i know myself i vaow afur gawd i dunt know what he wants nor what hes atryin to dewthat halloween the hill noises sounded louder than ever and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse after midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside and not until dawn did they finally quiet down then they vanished hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue what this meant no one could quite be certain till later none of the country folk seemed to have diedbut poor lavinia whateley the twisted albino was never seen againin the summer of 1927 wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them soon afterward earl sawyer told the loungers at osborns that more carpentry was going on in the whateley farmhouse wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before he was living in one of the sheds and sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous people generally suspected him of knowing something about his mothers disappearance and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now his height had increased to more than seven feet and shewed no signs of ceasing its developmentvthe following winter brought an event no less strange than wilburs first trip outside the dunwich region correspondence with the widener library at harvard the bibliothque nationale in paris the british museum the university of buenos ayres and the library of miskatonic university of arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted so at length he set out in person shabby dirty bearded and uncouth of dialect to consult the copy at miskatonic which was the nearest to him geographically almost eight feet tall and carrying a cheap new valise from osborns general store this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college librarythe hideousnecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius latin version as printed in spain in the seventeenth century he had never seen a city before but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds where indeed he passed heedlessly by the great whitefanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity and tugged frantically at its stout chainwilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of dr dees english version which his grandfather had bequeathed him and upon receiving access to the latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume this much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarianthe same erudite henry armitage am miskatonic ph d princeton litt d johns hopkins who had once called at the farm and who now politely plied him with questions he was looking he had to admit for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful nameyogsothothand it puzzled him to find discrepancies duplications and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy as he copied the formula he finally chose dr armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages the lefthand one of which in the latin version contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the worldnor is it to be thought ran the text as armitage mentally translated it that man is either the oldest or the last of earths masters or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone the old ones were the old ones are and the old ones shall be not in the spaces we know

what he had heard of dunwich and its brooding presences and of wilbur whateley and his dim hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tombs cold clamminess the bent goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension like something only partly of mankind and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter space and time presently wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange resonant fashion which hinted at soundproducing organs unlike the run of mankindsmr armitage he said i calclate ive got to take that book home theys things in it ive got to try under sarten conditions that i cant git here an it ud be a mortal sin to let a redtape rule hold me up let me take it along sir an ill swar they wunt nobody know the difference i dunt need to tell ye ill take good keer of it it want me that put this dee copy in the shape it is he stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarians face and his own goatish features grew crafty armitage halfready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself there was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres whateley saw how things stood and tried to answer lightlywal all right ef ye feel that way abaout it maybe harvard wunt be so fussy as yew be and without saying more he rose and strode out of the building stooping at each doorwayarmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog and studied whateleys gorillalike lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window he thought of the wild tales he had heard and recalled the old sunday stories in theadvertiserthese things and the lore he had picked up from dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there unseen things not of earthor at least not of tridimensional earthrushed foetid and horrible through new englands glens and brooded obscenely on the mountaintops of this he had long felt certain now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare he locked away thenecronomiconwith a shudder of disgust but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench as a foulness shall ye know them he quoted yesthe odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the whateley farmhouse less than three years before he thought of wilbur goatish and ominous once again and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentageinbreeding armitage muttered halfaloud to himself great god what simpletons shew them arthur machens great god pan and theyll think it a common dunwich scandal but what thingwhat cursed shapeless influence on or off this threedimensioned earthwas wilbur whateleys father born on candlemasnine months after mayeve of 1912 when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to arkham what walked on the mountains that maynight what roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in halfhuman flesh and bloodduring the ensuing weeks dr armitage set about to collect all possible data on wilbur whateley and the formless presences around dunwich he got in communication with dr houghton of aylesbury who had attended old whateley in his last illness and found much to ponder over in the grandfathers last words as quoted by the physician a visit to dunwich village failed to bring out much that was new but a close survey of thenecronomiconin those parts which wilbur had sought so avidly seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature methods and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet talks with several students of archaic lore in boston and letters to many others elsewhere gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear as the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper miskatonic valley and about the monstrous being known to the human world as wilbur whateleyvithe dunwich horror itself came between lammas and the equinox in 1928 and dr armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue he had heard meanwhile of whateleys grotesque trip to cambridge and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from thenecronomiconat the widener library those efforts had been in vain since armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume wilbur had been shockingly nervous at cambridge anxious for the book yet almost equally anxious to get home again as if he feared the results of being away longearly in august the halfexpected outcome developed and in the small hours of the 3d dr armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus deep and terrible the snarling halfmad growls and barks continued always in mounting volume but with hideously significant pauses then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throatsuch a scream as roused half the sleepers of arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwardsuch a scream as could come from no being born of earth or wholly of eartharmitage hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings saw that others were ahead of him and heard the echoes of a burglaralarm still shrilling from the library an open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight what had come had indeed completed its entrance for the barking and the screaming now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning proceeded unmistakably from within some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door among the others he saw professor warren rice and dr francis morgan men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings and these two he motioned to accompany him inside the inward sounds except for a watchful droning whine from the dog had by this time quite subsided but armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying manthe building was full of a frightful stench which dr armitage knew too well and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical readingroom whence the low whining came for a second nobody dared to turn on the light then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch one of the threeit is not certain whichshrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs professor rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant though he did not stumble or fallthe thing that lay halfbent on its side in a foetid pool of greenishyellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin it was not quite dead but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside bits of shoeleather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown near the central desk a revolver had fallen a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired the thing itself however crowded out all other images at the time it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common lifeforms of this planet and of the three known dimensions it was partly human beyond a doubt with very manlike hands and head and the goatish chinless face had the stamp of the whateleys upon it but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicatedabove the waist it was semianthropomorphic though its chest where the dogs rending paws still rested watchfully had the leathery reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator the back was piebald with yellow and black and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes below the waist though it was the worst for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur and from the abdomen a score of long greenishgrey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply their arrangement was odd and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system on each of the hips deep set in a kind of pinkish ciliated orbit was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat the limbs save for their black fur roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earths giant saurians and terminated in ridgyveined pads that were neither hooves nor claws when the thing breathed its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour as if from some circulatory cause normal to the nonhuman side of its ancestry in the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyishwhite in the spaces between the purple rings of genuine blood there was none only the foetid greenishyellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness and left a curious discolouration behind itas the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing it began to mumble without turning or raising its head dr armitage made no written record of its mouthings but asserts confidently that nothing in english was uttered at first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth but toward the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from thenecronomiconthat monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished these fragments as armitage recalls them ran something likengai nghaghaa buggshoggog yhah yogsothoth yogsothoth they trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipationthen came a halt in the gasping and the dog raised its head in a long lugubrious howl a change came over the yellow goatish face of the prostrate thing and the great black eyes fell in appallingly outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panicstruck whirring and fluttering against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight frantic at that which they had sought for preyall at once the dog started up abruptly gave a frightened bark and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered a cry rose from the crowd and dr armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came he was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one by this time two policemen had arrived and dr morgan meeting them in the vestibule was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stenchfilled readingroom till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered upmeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor one need not describe thekindandrateof shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of dr armitage and professor rice but it is permissible to say that aside from the external appearance of face and hands the really human element in wilbur whateley must have been very small when the medical examiner came there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared apparently whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton at least in any true or stable sense he had taken somewhat after his unknown fatherviiyet all this was only the prologue of the actual dunwich horror formalities were gone through by bewildered officials abnormal details were duly kept from press and public and men were sent to dunwich and aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late wilbur whateley they found the countryside in great agitation both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills and because of the unwonted stench and the surging lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by whateleys boardedup farmhouse earl sawyer who tended the horse and cattle during wilburs absence had developed a woefully acute case of nerves the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place and were glad to confine their survey of the deceaseds living quarters the newly mended sheds to a single visit they filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in aylesbury and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys decayed and undecayed of the upper miskatonic valleyan almost interminable manuscript in strange characters written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owners desk after a week of debate it was sent to miskatonic university together with the deceaseds collection of strange books for study and possible translation but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease no trace of the ancient gold with which wilbur and old whateley always paid their debts has yet been discoveredit was in the dark of september 9th that the horror broke loose the hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening and dogs barked frantically all night early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air about seven oclock luther brown the hired boy at george coreys between cold spring glen and the village rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to tenacre meadow with the cows he was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing

falls an bears denby that noon fully threequarters of the men and boys of dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade whateley ruins and cold spring glen examining in horror the vast monstrous prints the maimed bishop cattle the strange noisome wreck of the farmhouse and the bruised matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipicehanging underbrush it was as though a house launched by an avalanche had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope from below no sound came but only a distant undefinable foetor and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue rather than descend and beard the unknown cyclopean horror in its lair three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen someone telephoned the news to theaylesbury transcriptbut the editor accustomed to wild tales from dunwich did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it an item soon afterward reproduced by the associated pressthat night everyone went home and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible needless to say no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage about two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at elmer fryes on the eastern edge of cold spring glen and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside mrs frye proposed telephoning the neighbours and elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations it came apparently from the barn and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle the dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fearnumbed family frye lit a lantern through force of habit but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard the children and the womenfolk whimpered kept from screaming by some obscure vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence at last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning and a great snapping crashing and crackling ensued the fryes huddled together in the sittingroom did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in cold spring glen then amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen selina frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horrorthe next day all the countryside was in a panic and cowed uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the frye farmyard monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in of the cattle only a quarter could be found and identified some of these were in curious fragments and all that survived had to be shot earl sawyer suggested that help be asked from aylesbury or arkham but others maintained it would be of no use old zebulon whateley of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hilltops he came of a line where tradition ran strong and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with wilbur and his grandfatherdarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence in a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before and a futile ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about nothing however occurred except some hill noises and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come there were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majoritywhen night came again the barricading was repeated though there was less huddling together of families in the morning both the frye and the seth bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting sentinel hill as before the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions as if the moving mountain had come from cold spring glen and returned to it along the same path at the base of the hill a thirtyfoot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail whatever the horror was it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality and as the investigators climbed around to the hills summit by safer routes they saw that the trail endedor rather reversedthereit was here that the whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the tablelike stone on mayeve and hallowmass now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped men looked at one another and muttered then they looked down the hill apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent to speculate was futile reason logic and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded only old zebulon who was not with the group could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanationthursday night began much like the others but it ended less happily the whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep and about 3 am all the party telephones rang tremulously those who took down their receivers heard a frightmad voice shriek out help oh my gawd and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation there was nothing more no one dared do anything and no one knew till morning whence the call came then those who had heard it called everyone on the line and found that only the fryes did not reply the truth appeared an hour later when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the frye place at the head of the glen it was horrible yet hardly a surprise there were more swaths and monstrous prints but there was no longer any house it had caved in like an eggshell and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered only a stench and a tarry stickiness the elmer fryes had been erased from dunwichviiiin the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelflined room in arkham the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley delivered to miskatonic university for translation had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern its very alphabet notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded arabic used in mesopotamia being absolutely unknown to any available authority the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet giving the effect of a cipher though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used the ancient books taken from whateleys quarters while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science were of no assistance whatever in this matter one of them a heavy tome with an iron clasp was in another unknown alphabetthis one of a very different cast and resembling sanscrit more than anything else the old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of dr armitage both because of his peculiar interest in the whateley matter and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle agesarmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the saracenic world that question however he did not deem vital since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if as he suspected they were used as a cipher in a modern language it was his belief that considering the great amount of text involved the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in englishdr armitage knew from the repeated failures of his colleagues that the riddle was a deep and complex one and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial all through late august he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library and wading night after night amidst the arcana of trithemiuspoligraphiagiambattista portasde furtivis literarum notisde vigenrestrait des chiffresfalconerscryptomenysis patefactadavys and thicknesses eighteenthcentury treatises and such fairly modern authorities as blair von marten and klberskryptographikhe interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table and the message built up with arbitrary keywords known only to the initiated the older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones and armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters several times he seemed near daylight only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle then as september approached the clouds began to clear certain letters as used in certain parts of the manuscript emerged definitely and unmistakably and it became obvious that the text was indeed in englishon the evening of september 2nd the last major barrier gave way and dr armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of wilbur whateleys annals it was in truth a diary as all had thought and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered an entry dated november 26 1916 proved highly startling and disquieting it was written he remembered by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteentoday learned the aklo for the sabaoth it ran which did not like it being answerable from the hill and not from the air that upstairs more ahead of me than i had thought it would be and is not like to have much earth brain shot elam hutchins collie jack when he went to bite me and elam says he would kill me if he dast i guess he wont grandfather kept me saying the dho formula last night and i think i saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles i shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off if i cant break through with the dhohna formula when i commit it they from the air told me at sabbat that it will be years before i can clear off the earth and i guess grandfather will be dead then so i shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the yr and the nhhngr they from outside will help but they cannot take body without human blood that upstairs looks it will have the right cast i can see it a little when i make the voorish sign or blow the powder of ibn ghazi at it and it is near like them at mayeve on the hill the other face may wear off some i wonder how i shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it he that came with the aklo sabaoth said i may be transfigured there being much of outside to work onmorning found dr armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration he had not left the manuscript all night but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text he had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful all that day he read on now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary lunch and dinner were brought him but he ate only the smallest fraction of either toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to mans existence that he had uncoveredon the morning of september 4th professor rice and dr morgan insisted on seeing him for a while and departed trembling and ashengrey that evening he went to bed but slept only fitfully wednesdaythe next dayhe was back at the manuscript and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered in the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easychair in his office but was at the manuscript again before dawn some time before noon his physician dr hartwell called to see him and insisted that he cease work he refused intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due course of timethat evening just as twilight fell he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted his wife bringing his dinner found him in a halfcomatose state but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken weakly rising he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket he had sufficient strength to get home but was so clearly in need of medical aid that dr hartwell was summoned at once as the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over againbut what in gods name can we dodr armitage slept but was partly delirious the next day he made no explanations to hartwell but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with rice and morgan his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed including frantic appeals that something in a boardedup farmhouse be destroyed and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension he would shout that the world was in danger since the elder things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen vigintillions of aeons ago at other times he would call for the dreadednecronomiconand thedaemonolatreiaof remigius in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured upstop them stop them he would shout those whateleys meant to let them in and the worst of all is left tell rice and morgan we must do somethingits a blind business but i know how to make the powder it hasnt been fed since the second of august when wilbur came here to his death and at that rate but armitage had a sound physique despite his seventythree years and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever he woke late friday clear of head though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon rice and morgan for a conference and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance of scepticism there was none all three had seen the body of wilbur whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madmans ravingopinions were divided as to notifying the massachusetts state police and the negative finally won there were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan but all day sunday armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory the more he reflected on the hellish diary the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which wilbur whateley had left behind himthe earththreatening entity which unknown to him was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable dunwich horrormonday was a repetition of sunday with dr armitage for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain by tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out and believed he would try a trip to dunwich within a week then on wednesday the great shock came tucked obscurely away in a corner of thearkham advertiserwas a facetious little item from the associated press telling what a recordbreaking monster the bootleg whiskey of dunwich had raised up armitage half stunned could only telephone for rice and morgan far into the night they discussed and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before himixfriday morning armitage rice and morgan set out by motor for dunwich arriving at the village about one in the afternoon the day was pleasant but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep shadowy ravines of the stricken region now and then on some mountaintop a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky from the air of hushed fright at osborns store they knew something hideous had happened and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard the wounded seth bishop cattle and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance and he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summitat length the visitors apprised of a party of state police which had come from aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the frye tragedy decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable this however they found more easily planned than performed since no sign of the party could be found in any direction there had been five of them in a car but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the frye yard the natives all of whom had talked with the policemen seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions then old sam hutchins thought of something and turned pale nudging fred farr and pointing to the dank deep hollow that yawned close bygawd he gasped i telled em not ter go daown into the glen an i never thought nobodyd dew it with them tracks an that smell an the whippoorwills ascreechin daown thar in the dark o noonday a cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive unconscious listening armitage now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his night would soon fall and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch coursenegotium perambulans in tenebris the old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised he saw that his electric flashlight was in working order rice beside him took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects whilst morgan uncased the biggame rifle on which he relied despite his colleagues warnings that no material weapon would be of helparmitage having read the hideous diary knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect but he did not add to the fright of the dunwich people by giving any hints or clues he hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped as the shadows gathered the natives commenced to disperse homeward anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose they shook their heads at the visitors plan to stand guard at the frye ruins near the glen and as they left had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers againthere were rumblings under the hills that night and the whippoorwills piped threateningly once in a while a wind sweeping up out of cold spring glen would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being but the lookedfor terror did not appear whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time and armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the darkmorning came wanly and the nightsounds ceased it was a grey bleak day with now and then a drizzle of rain and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest the men from arkham were undecided what to do seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings they debated the wisdom of waiting or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless monstrous quarry the downpour waxed in heaviness and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons sheet lightning shimmered and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand as if descending into the accursed glen itself the sky grew very dark and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short sharp one followed by clear weatherit was still gruesomely dark when not much over an hour later a confused babel of voices sounded down the road another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men running shouting and even whimpering hysterically someone in the lead began sobbing out words and the arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent formoh my gawd my gawd the voice choked out its agoin aginan this time by dayits aoutits aout an amovin this very minute an only the lord knows when itll be on us allthe speaker panted into silence but another took up his messagenigh on a haour ago zeb whateley here heerd the phone aringin an it was mis corey

think its the lords jedgment fer our iniquities that no mortal kin ever set asidearmitage saw that the time for positive action had come and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rusticswe must follow it boys he made his voice as reassuring as possible i believe theres a chance of putting it out of business you men know that those whateleys were wizardswell this thing is a thing of wizardry and must be put down by the same means ive seen wilbur whateleys diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away of course one cant be sure but we can always take a chance its invisiblei knew it would bebut theres a powder in this longdistance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second later on well try it its a frightful thing to have alive but it isnt as bad as what wilbur would have let in if hed lived longer youll never know what the world has escaped now weve only this one thing to fight and it cant multiply it can though do a lot of harm so we mustnt hesitate to rid the community of itwe must follow itand the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked let somebody lead the wayi dont know your roads very well but ive an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots how about itthe men shuffled about a moment and then earl sawyer spoke softly pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening raini guess ye kin git to seth bishops quickest by cuttin acrost the lower medder here wadin the brook at the low place an climbin through carriers mowin and the timberlot beyont that comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh sethsa leetle tother sidearmitage with rice and morgan started to walk in the direction indicated and most of the natives followed slowly the sky was growing lighter and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away when armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction joe osborn warned him and walked ahead to shew the right one courage and confidence were mounting though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder put these qualities to a severe testat length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out they were a little beyond the seth bishop place but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had passed by only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend it was the frye incident all over again and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the bishop house and barn no one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked whateley farmhouse and the altarcrowned slopes of sentinel hillas the men passed the site of wilbur whateleys abode they shuddered visibly and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal it was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon opposite the base of sentinel hill the tracks left the road and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monsters former route to and from the summitarmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill then he handed the instrument to morgan whose sight was keener after a moment of gazing morgan cried out sharply passing the glass to earl sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger sawyer as clumsy as most nonusers of optical devices are fumbled a while but eventually focussed the lenses with armitages aid when he did so his cry was less restrained than morgans had beengawd almighty the grass an bushes is amovin its agoin upslowlikecreepin up ter the top this minute heaven only knows what furthen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers it was one thing to chase the nameless entity but quite another to find it spells might be all rightbut suppose they werent voices began questioning armitage about what he knew of the thing and no reply seemed quite to satisfy everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane experience of mankindxin the end the three men from arkhamold whitebearded dr armitage stocky irongrey professor rice and lean youngish dr morganascended the mountain alone after much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around it was hard going and armitage had to be helped more than once high above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed with snaillike deliberateness then it was obvious that the pursuers were gainingcurtis whateleyof the undecayed branchwas holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath he told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending this indeed proved to be true and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed itthen wesley corey who had taken the glass cried out that armitage was adjusting the sprayer which rice held and that something must be about to happen the crowd stirred uneasily recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility two or three men shut their eyes but curtis whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost he saw that rice from the partys point of vantage above and behind the entity had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effectthose without the telescope saw only an instants flash of grey clouda cloud about the size of a moderately large buildingnear the top of the mountain curtis who had held the instrument dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankledeep mud of the road he reeled and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him all he could do was moan halfinaudiblyoh oh great gawd that that there was a pandemonium of questioning and only henry wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud curtis was past all coherence and even isolated replies were almost too much for himbiggern a barn all made o squirmin ropes hull thing sort o shaped like a hens egg biggern anything with dozens o legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step nothin solid abaout itall like jelly an made o seprit wrigglin ropes pushed clost together great bulgin eyes all over it ten or twenty maouths or

whatever it was proved too much for poor curtis and he collapsed completely before he could say more fred farr and will hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass henry wheeler trembling turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed only thesenothing more then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind and even in the underbrush of sentinel hill itself it was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancyearl sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge virtually level with the altarstone but at a considerable distance from it one figure he said seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals and as sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint halfmusical sound from the distance as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures the weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation i guess hes sayin the spell whispered wheeler as he snatched back the telescope the whippoorwills were piping wildly and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritualsuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud it was a very peculiar phenomenon and was plainly marked by all a rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky lightning flashed aloft and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm the chanting of the men from arkham now became unmistakable and wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogsthe change in the quality of the daylight increased and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder a purplish darkness born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the skys blue pressed down upon the rumbling hills then the lightning flashed again somewhat brighter than before and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altarstone on the distant height no one however had been using the telescope at that instant the whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation and the men of dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surchargedwithout warning came those deep cracked raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them not from any human throat were they born for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions rather would one have said they came from the pit itself had not their source been so unmistakably the altarstone on the peak it is almost erroneous to call themsoundsat all since so much of their ghastly infrabass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear yet one must do so since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of halfarticulatewordsthey were loudloud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoedyet did they come from no visible being and because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of nonvisible beings the huddled crowd at the mountains base huddled still closer and winced as if in expectation of a blowygnaiih ygnaiih thflthkhngha yogsothoth rang the hideous croaking out of spaceybthnk hehyengrkdllh the speaking impulse seemed to falter here as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on henry wheeler strained his eye at the telescope but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination from what black wells of acherontic fear or feeling from what unplumbed gulfs of extracosmic consciousness or obscure longlatent heredity were those halfarticulate thundercroakings drawn presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark utter ultimate frenzyehyayayayahaaheyayayayaaaa nghaaaaa nghaaaa hyuh hyuh help help fffffffather father yogsothoth but that was all the pallid group in the road still reeling at theindisputably englishsyllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altarstone were never to hear such syllables again instead they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills the deafening cataclysmic peal whose source be it inner earth or sky no hearer was ever able to place a single lightningbolt shot from the purple zenith to the altarstone and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside trees grass and underbrush were whipped into a fury and the frightened crowd at the mountains base weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them were almost hurled off their feet dogs howled from the distance green grass and foliage wilted to a curious sickly yellowgrey and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwillsthe stench left quickly but the vegetation never came right again to this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted they were grave and quiet and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering in reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital factthe thing has gone forever armitage said it has been split up into what it was originally made of and can never exist again it was an impossibility in a normal world only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know it was like its fatherand most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hillsthere was a brief silence and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity so that he put his hands to his head with a moan memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him againoh oh my gawd that haff facethat haff face on top of it that face with the red eyes an crinkly albino hair an no chin like the whateleys it was a octopus centipede spider kind o thing but they was a haffshaped mans face on top of it an it looked like wizard whateleys only it was yards an yards acrost he paused exhausted as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror only old zebulon whateley who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore spoke aloudfifteen year gone he rambled i heerd ol whateley say as haow some day wed hear a child o lavinnys acallin its fathers name on the top o sentinel hill but joe osborn interrupted him to question the arkham men anewwhat was it anyhaowan haowever did young wizard whateley call it aout o the air it come fromarmitage chose his words very carefullyit waswell it was mostly a kind of force that doesnt belong in our part of space a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature we have no business calling in such things from outside and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to there was some of it in wilbur whateley himselfenough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight im going to burn his accursed diary and if you men are wise youll dynamite that altarstone up there and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills things like that brought down the beings those whateleys were so fond ofthe beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purposebut as to this thing weve just sent backthe whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come it grew fast and big from the same reason that wilbur grew fast and bigbut it beat him because it had a greater share of theoutsidenessin it you neednt ask how wilbur called it out of the air he didnt call it outit was his twin brother but it looked more like the father than he did,1
for one who has never faced the danger of legal execution i have a rather queer horror of the electric chair as a subject indeed i think the topic gives me more of a shudder than it gives many a man who has been on trial for his life the reason is that i associate the thing with an incident of forty years agoa very strange incident which brought me close to the edge of the unknowns black abyssin 1889 i was an auditor and investigator connected with the tlaxcala mining company of san francisco which operated several small silver and copper properties in the san mateo mountains in mexico there had been some trouble at mine no 3 which had a surly furtive assistant superintendent named arthur feldon and on august 6th the firm received a telegram saying that feldon had decamped taking with him all the stock records securities and private papers and leaving the whole clerical and financial situation in dire confusionthis development was a severe blow to the company and late in the afternoon president mccomb called me into his office to give orders for the recovery of the papers at any cost there were he knew grave drawbacks i had never seen feldon and there were only very indifferent photographs to go by moreover my own wedding was set for thursday of the following weekonly nine days aheadso that i was naturally not eager to be hurried off to mexico on a manhunt of indefinite length the need however was so great that mccomb felt justified in asking me to go at once and i for my part decided that the effect on my status with the company would make ready acquiescence eminently worth whilei was to start that night using the presidents private car as far as mexico city after which i would have to take a narrowgauge railway to the mines jackson the superintendent of no 3 would give me all details and any possible clues upon my arrival and then the search would begin in earnestthrough the mountains down to the coast or among the byways of mexico city as the case might be i set out with a grim determination to get the matter doneand successfully doneas swiftly as possible and tempered my discontent with pictures of an early return with papers and culprit and of a wedding which would be almost a triumphal ceremonyhaving notified my family fiance and principal friends and made hasty preparations for the trip i met president mccomb at eight pm at the southern pacific depot received from him some written instructions and a checkbook and left in his car attached to the 815 eastbound transcontinental train the journey that followed seemed destined for uneventfulness and after a good nights sleep i revelled in the ease of the private car so thoughtfully assigned me reading my instructions with care and formulating plans for the capture of feldon and the recovery of the documents i knew the tlaxcala country quite wellprobably much better than the missing manhence had a certain amount of advantage in my search unless he had already used the railwayaccording to the instructions feldon had been a subject of worry to superintendent jackson for some time acting secretively and working unaccountably in the companys laboratory at odd hours that he was implicated with a mexican boss and several peons in some thefts of ore was strongly suspected but though the natives had been discharged there was not enough evidence to warrant any positive step regarding the subtle official indeed despite his furtiveness there seemed to be more of defiance than of guilt in the mans bearing he wore a chip on his shoulder and talked as if the company were cheating him instead of his cheating the company the obvious surveillance of his colleagues jackson wrote appeared to irritate him increasingly and now he had gone with everything of importance in the office of his possible whereabouts no guess could be made though jacksons final telegram suggested the wild slopes of the sierra de malinche that tall mythsurrounded peak with the corpseshaped silhouette from whose neighbourhood the thieving natives were said to have comeat el paso which we reached at two am of the night following our start my private car was detached from the transcontinental train and joined to an engine specially ordered by telegraph to take it southward to mexico city i continued to drowse till dawn and all the next day grew bored on the flat desert chihuahua landscape the crew had told me we were due in mexico city at noon friday but i soon saw that countless delays were wasting precious hours there were waits on sidings all along the singletracked route and now and then a hotbox or other difficulty would further complicate the scheduleat torren we were six hours late and it was almost eight oclock on friday eveningfully twelve hours behind schedulewhen the conductor consented to do some speeding in an effort to make up time my nerves were on edge and i could do nothing but pace the car in desperation in the end i found that the speeding had been purchased at a high cost indeed for within a halfhour the symptoms of a hotbox had developed in my car itself so that after a maddening wait the crew decided that all the bearings would have to be overhauled after a quarterspeed limp ahead to the next station with shopsthe factory town of quertaro this was the last straw and i almost stamped like a child actually i sometimes caught myself pushing at my chairarm as if trying to urge the train forward at a less snaillike paceit was almost ten in the evening when we drew into quertaro and i spent a fretful hour on the station platform while my car was sidetracked and tinkered at by a dozen native mechanics at last they told me the job was too much for them since the forward truck needed new parts which could not be obtained nearer than mexico city everything indeed seemed against me and i gritted my teeth when i thought of feldon getting farther and farther awayperhaps to the easy cover of vera cruz with its shipping or mexico city with its varied rail facilitieswhile fresh delays kept me tied and helpless of course jackson had notified the police in all the cities around but i knew with sorrow what their efficiency amounted tothe best i could do i soon found out was to take the regular night express for mexico city which ran from aguas calientes and made a fiveminute stop at quertaro it would be along at one am if on time and was due in mexico city at five oclock saturday morning when i purchased my ticket i found that the train would be made up of european compartment carriages instead of long american cars with rows of twoseat chairs these had been much used in the early days of mexican railroading owing to the european construction interests back of the first lines and in 1889 the mexican central was still running a fair number of them on its shorter trips ordinarily i prefer the american coaches since i hate to have people facing me but for this once i was glad of the foreign carriage at such a time of night i stood a good chance of having a whole compartment to myself and in my tired nervously hypersensitive state i welcomed the solitudeas well as the comfortably upholstered seat with soft armrests and headcushion running the whole width of the vehicle i bought a firstclass ticket obtained my valise from the sidetracked private car telegraphed both president mccomb and jackson of what had happened and settled down in the station to wait for the night express as patiently as my strained nerves would let mefor a wonder the train was only half an hour late though even so the solitary station vigil had about finished my endurance the conductor shewing me into a compartment told me he expected to make up the delay and reach the capital on time and i stretched myself comfortably on the forwardfacing seat in the expectation of a quiet threeandahalfhour run the light from the overhead oil lamp was soothingly dim and i wondered whether i could snatch some muchneeded sleep in spite of my anxiety and nervetension it seemed as the train jolted into motion that i was alone and i was heartily glad of it my thoughts leaped ahead to my quest and i nodded with the accelerating rhythm of the speeding string of carriagesthen suddenly i perceived that i was not alone after all in the corner diagonally opposite me slumped down so that his face was invisible sat a roughly clad man of unusual size whom the feeble light had failed to reveal before beside him on the seat was a huge valise battered and bulging and tightly gripped even in his sleep by one of his incongruously slender hands as the engine whistled sharply at some curve or crossing the sleeper started nervously into a kind of watchful halfawakening raising his head and disclosing a handsome face bearded and clearly anglosaxon with dark lustrous eyes at sight of me his wakefulness became complete and i wondered at the rather hostile wildness of his glance no doubt i thought he resented my presence when he had hoped to have the compartment alone all the way just as i was myself disappointed to find strange company in the halflighted carriage the best we could do however was to accept the situation gracefully so i began apologising to the man for my intrusion he seemed to be a fellowamerican and we could both feel more at ease after a few civilities then we could leave each other in peace for the balance of the journeyto my surprise the stranger did not respond to my courtesies with so much as a word instead he kept staring at me fiercely and almost appraisingly and brushed aside my embarrassed proffer of a cigar with a nervous lateral movement of his disengaged hand his other hand still tensely clutched the great worn valise and his whole person seemed to radiate some obscure malignity after a time he abruptly turned his face toward the window though there was nothing to see in the dense blackness outside oddly he appeared to be looking at something as intently as if there really were something to look at i decided to leave him to his own curious devices and meditations without further annoyance so settled back in my seat drew the brim of my soft hat over my face and closed my eyes in an effort to snatch the sleep i had half counted oni could not have dozed very long or very fully when my eyes fell open as if in response to some external force closing them again with some determination i renewed my quest of a nap yet wholly without avail an intangible influence seemed bent on keeping me awake so raising my head i looked about the dimly lighted compartment to see if anything were amiss all appeared normal but i noticed that the stranger in the opposite corner was looking at me very intentlyintently though without any of the geniality or friendliness which would have implied a change from his former surly attitude i did not attempt conversation this time but leaned back in my previous sleepy posture half closing my eyes as if i had dozed off once more yet continuing to watch him curiously from beneath my downturned hat brimas the train rattled onward through the night i saw a subtle and gradual metamorphosis come over the expression of the staring man evidently satisfied that i was asleep he allowed his face to reflect a curious jumble of emotions the nature of which seemed anything but reassuring hatred fear triumph and fanaticism flickered compositely over the lines of his lips and the angles of his eyes while his gaze became a glare of really alarming greed and ferocity suddenly it dawned upon me that this man was mad and dangerously soi will not pretend that i was anything but deeply and thoroughly frightened when i saw how things stood perspiration started out all over me and i had hard work to maintain my attitude of relaxation and slumber life had many attractions for me just then and the thought of dealing with a homicidal maniacpossibly armed and certainly powerful to a marvellous degreewas a dismaying and terrifying one my disadvantage in any sort of struggle was enormous for the man was a virtual giant evidently in the best of athletic trim while i have always been rather frail and was then almost worn out with anxiety sleeplessness and nervous tension it was undeniably a bad moment for me and i felt pretty close to a horrible death as i recognised the fury of madness in the strangers eyes events from the past came up into my consciousness as if for a farewelljust as a drowning mans whole life is said to resurrect itself before him at the last momentof course i had my revolver in my coat pocket but any motion of mine to reach and draw it would be instantly obvious moreover if i did secure it there was no telling what effect it would have on the maniac even if i shot him once or twice he might have enough remaining strength to get the gun from me and deal with me in his own way or if he were armed himself he might shoot or stab without trying to disarm me one can cow a sane man by covering him with a pistol but an insane mans complete indifference to consequences gives him a strength and menace quite superhuman for the time being even in those prefreudian days i had a commonsense realisation of the dangerous power of a person without normal inhibitions that the stranger in the corner was indeed about to start some murderous action his burning eyes and twitching facial muscles did not permit me to doubt for a momentsuddenly i heard his breath begin to come in excited gasps and saw his chest heaving with mounting excitement the time for a showdown was close and i tried desperately to think of the best thing to do without interrupting my pretence of sleep i began to slide my right hand gradually and inconspicuously toward the pocket containing my pistol watching the madman closely as i did so to see if he would detect any move unfortunately he didalmost before he had time to register the fact in his expression with a bound so agile and abrupt as to be almost incredible in a man of his size he was upon me before i knew what had happened looming up and swaying forward like a giant ogre of legend and pinioning me with one powerful hand while with the other he forestalled me in reaching the revolver taking it from my pocket and placing it in his own he released me contemptuously well knowing how fully his physique placed me at his mercy then he stood up at his full heighthis head almost touching the roof of the carriageand stared down at me with eyes whose fury had quickly turned to a look of pitying scorn and ghoulish calculationi did not move and after a moment the man resumed his seat opposite me smiling a ghastly smile as he opened his great bulging valise and extracted an article of peculiar appearancea rather large cage of semiflexible wire woven somewhat like a baseball catchers mask but shaped more like the helmet of a divingsuit its top was connected with a cord whose other end remained in the valise this device he fondled with obvious affection cradling it in his lap as he looked at me afresh and licked his bearded lips with an almost feline motion of the tongue then for the first time he spokein a deep mellow voice of softness and cultivation startlingly at variance with his rough corduroy clothes and unkempt aspectyou are fortunate sir i shall use you first of all you shall go into history as the first fruits of a remarkable invention vast sociological consequencesi shall let my light shine as it were im radiating all the time but nobody knows it now you shall know intelligent guineapig cats and burrosit worked even with a burro he paused while his bearded features underwent a convulsive motion closely synchronised with a vigorous gyratory shaking of the whole head it was as though he were shaking clear of some nebulous obstructing medium for the gesture was followed by a clarification or subtilisation of expression which hid the more obvious madness in a look of suave composure through which the craftiness gleamed only dimly i glimpsed the difference at once and put in a word to see if i could lead his mind into harmless channelsyou seem to have a marvellously fine instrument if im any judge wont you tell me how you came to invent ithe noddedmere logical reflection dear sir i consulted the needs of the age and acted upon them others might have done the same had their minds been as powerfulthat is as capable of sustained concentrationas mine i had the sense of convictionthe available will powerthat is all i realised as no one else has yet realised how imperative it is to remove everybody from the earth before quetzalcoatl comes back and realised also that it must be done elegantly i hate butchery of any kind and hanging is barbarously crude you know last year the new york legislature voted to adopt electric execution for condemned menbut all the apparatus they have in mind is as primitive as stephensons rocket or davenports first electric engine i knew of a better way and told them so but they paid no attention to me god the fools as if i didnt know all there is to know about men and death and electricitystudent man and boytechnologist and engineersoldier of fortune he leaned back and narrowed his eyesi was in maximilians army twenty years and more ago they were going to make me a nobleman then those damned greasers killed him and i had to go home but i came backback and forth back and forth i live in rochester ny his eyes grew deeply crafty and he leaned forward touching me on the knee with the fingers of a paradoxically delicate handi came back i say and i went deeper than any of them i hate greasers but i like mexicans a puzzle listen to me young fellowyou dont think mexico is really spanish do you god if you knew

conversational toneit would surprise you to know what things are told in the mountains huitzilopotchli is coming back of that there can be no doubt any peon south of mexico city can tell you that but i meant to do nothing about it i went home as i tell you again and again and was going to benefit society with my electric executioner when that cursed albany legislature adopted the other way a joke

you carebut youll soon knowwhy damn you all the good there ever will be in that electric chair will have been stolen from me the ghost of nezahualpilli told me that on the sacred mountain they watched

needs is testing that is ithere the wire hood or headnet is flexible and slips on easily neckpiece binds but doesnt choke electrodes touch forehead and base of cerebellumall thats necessary stop the head and what else can go the fools up at albany with their carved oak easychair think theyve got to make it a headtofoot affair idiotsdont they know that you dont need to shoot a man through the body

hearingnobody knowsi alone have the secretthats why i and quetzalcoatl and huitzilopotchli will rule the world alonei and they if i choose to let them but i must have experimental subjectssubjectsdo you know whom ive chosen for the firsti tried jocoseness quickly merging into friendly seriousness as a sedative quick thought and apt words might save me yetwell there are lots of fine subjects among the politicians of san francisco where i come from they need your treatment and id like to help you introduce it but really i think i can help you in all truth i have some influence in sacramento and if youll go back to the states with me after im through with my business in mexico ill see that you get a hearinghe answered soberly and civillynoi cant go back i swore not to when those criminals at albany turned down my invention and set spies to watch me and steal from me but i must have american subjects those greasers are under a curse and would be too easy and the fullblood indiansthe real children of the feathered serpentare sacred and inviolate except for proper sacrificial victims and even those must be slain according to ceremony i must have americans without going backand the first man i choose will be signally honoured do you know who he isi temporised desperatelyoh if thats all the trouble ill find you a dozen firstrate yankee specimens as soon as we get to mexico city i know where there are lots of small mining men who wouldnt be missed for daysbut he cut me short with a new and sudden air of authority which had a touch of real dignity in itthatll doweve trifled long enough get up and stand erect like a man youre the subject ive chosen and youll thank me for the honour in the other world just as the sacrificial victim thanks the priest for transferring him to eternal glory a new principleno other man alive has dreamed of such a battery and it might never again be hit on if the world experimented a thousand years do you know that atoms arent what they seem fools a century after this some dolt would be guessing if i were to let the world liveas i arose at his command he drew additional feet of cord from the valise and stood erect beside me the wire helmet outstretched toward me in both hands and a look of real exaltation on his tanned and bearded face for an instant he seemed like a radiant hellenic mystagogue or hierophanthere o youtha libation wine of the cosmosnectar of the starry spaceslinosiacchusialmenoszagreusdionysosatyshylassprung from apollo and slain by the hounds of argosseed of psamathechild of the sunevo evohe was chanting again and this time his mind seemed far back amongst the classic memories of his college days in my erect posture i noticed the nearness of the signal cord overhead and wondered whether i could reach it through some gesture of ostensible response to his ceremonial mood it was worth trying so with an antiphonal cry of evo i put my arms forward and upward toward him in a ritualistic fashion hoping to give the cord a tug before he could notice the act but it was useless he saw my purpose and moved one hand toward the righthand coat pocket where my revolver lay no words were needed and we stood for a moment like carven figures then he quietly said make hasteagain my mind rushed frantically about seeking avenues of escape the doors i knew were not locked on mexican trains but my companion could easily forestall me if i tried to unlatch one and jump out besides our speed was so great that success in that direction would probably be as fatal as failure the only thing to do was to play for time of the threeandahalfhour trip a good slice was already worn away and once we got to mexico city the guards and police in the station would provide instant safetythere would i thought be two distinct times for diplomatic stalling if i could get him to postpone the slipping on of the hood that much time would be gained of course i had no belief that the thing was really deadly but i knew enough of madmen to understand what would happen when it failed to work to his disappointment would be added a mad sense of my responsibility for the failure and the result would be a red chaos of murderous rage therefore the experiment must be postponed as long as possible yet the second opportunity did exist for if i planned cleverly i might devise explanations for the failure which would hold his attention and lead him into more or less extended searches for corrective influences i wondered just how far his credulity went and whether i could prepare in advance a prophecy of failure which would make the failure itself stamp me as a seer or initiate or perhaps a god i had enough of a smattering of mexican mythology to make it worth trying though i would try other delaying influences first and let the prophecy come as a sudden revelation would he spare me in the end if i could make him think me a prophet or divinity could i get by as quetzalcoatl or huitzilopotchli anything to drag matters out till five oclock when we were due in mexico citybut my opening stall was the veteran willmaking ruse as the maniac repeated his command for haste i told him of my family and intended marriage and asked for the privilege of leaving a message and disposing of my money and effects if i said he would lend me some paper and agree to mail what i should write i could die more peacefully and willingly after some cogitation he gave a favourable verdict and fished in his valise for a pad which he handed me solemnly as i resumed my seat i produced a pencil artfully breaking the point at the outset and causing some delay while he searched for one of his own when he gave me this he took my broken pencil and proceeded to sharpen it with a large hornhandled knife which had been in his belt under his coat evidently a second pencilbreaking would not profit me greatlywhat i wrote i can hardly recall at this date it was largely gibberish and composed of random scraps of memorised literature when i could think of nothing else to set down i made my handwriting as illegible as i could without destroying its nature as writing for i knew he would be likely to look at the result before commencing his experiment and realised how he would react to the sight of obvious nonsense the ordeal was a terrible one and i chafed each second at the slowness of the train in the past i had often whistled a brisk gallop to the sprightly tac of wheels on rails but now the tempo seemed slowed down to that of a funeral marchmy funeral march i grimly reflectedmy ruse worked till i had covered over four pages six by nine when at last the madman drew out his watch and told me i could have but five minutes more what should i do next i was hastily going through the form of concluding the will when a new idea struck me ending with a flourish and handing him the finished sheets which he thrust carelessly into his lefthand coat pocket i reminded him of my influential sacramento friends who would be so much interested in his inventionoughtnt i to give you a letter of introduction to them i said oughtnt i to make a signed sketch and description of your executioner so that theyll grant you a cordial hearing they can make you famous you knowand theres no question at all but that theyll adopt your method for the state of california if they hear of it through someone like me whom they know and trusti was taking this tack on the chance that his thoughts as a disappointed inventor would let him forget the aztecreligious side of his mania for a while when he veered to the latter again i reflected i would spring the revelation and prophecy the scheme worked for his eyes glowed an eager assent though he brusquely told me to be quick he further emptied the valise lifting out a queerlooking congeries of glass cells and coils to which the wire from the helmet was attached and delivering a fire of running comment too technical for me to follow yet apparently quite plausible and straightforward i pretended to note down all he said wondering as i did so whether the queer apparatus was really a battery after all would i get a slight shock when he applied the device the man surely talked as if he were a genuine electrician description of his own invention was clearly a congenial task for him and i saw he was not as impatient as before the hopeful grey of dawn glimmered red through the windows before he wound up and i felt at last that my chance of escape had really become tangiblebut he too saw the dawn and began glaring wildly again he knew the train was due in mexico city at five and would certainly force quick action unless i could override all his judgment with engrossing ideas as he rose with a determined air setting the battery on the seat beside the open valise i reminded him that i had not made the needed sketch and asked him to hold the headpiece so that i could draw it near the battery he complied and resumed his seat with many admonitions to me to hurry after another moment i paused for some information asking him how the victim was placed for execution and how his presumable struggles were overcomewhy he replied the criminal is securely strapped to a post it does not matter how much he tosses his head for the helmet fits tightly and draws even closer when the current comes on we turn the switch graduallyyou see it here a carefully arranged affair with a rheostata new idea for delay occurred to me as the tilled fields and increasingly frequent houses in the dawnlight outside told of our approach to the capital at lastbut i said i must draw the helmet in place on a human head as well as beside the battery cant you slip it on yourself a moment so that i can sketch you with it the papers as well as the officials will want all this and they are strong on completenessi had by chance made a better shot than i had planned for at my mention of the press the madmans eyes lit up afreshthe papers yesdamn them you can make even the papers give me a hearing they all laughed at me and wouldnt print a word here you hurry up weve not a second to losehe had slipped the headpiece on and was watching my flying pencil avidly the wire mesh gave him a grotesque comic look as he sat there with nervously twitching handsnow curse em theyll print pictures ill revise your sketch if you make any blundersmust be accurate at any cost police will find you afterwardtheyll tell how it works associated press itemback up your letterimmortal fame hurry i sayhurry confound youthe train was lurching over the poorer roadbed near the city and we swayed disconcertingly now and then with this excuse i managed to break the pencil again but of course the maniac at once handed me my own which he had sharpened my first batch of ruses was about used up and i felt that i should have to submit to the headpiece in a moment we were still a good quarterhour from the terminal and it was about time for me to divert my companion to his religious side and spring the divine prophecymustering up my scraps of nahuanaztec mythology i suddenly threw down pencil and paper and commenced to chanti i tloquenahuaque thou who art all in thyself thou too ipalnemoan by whom we live i hear i hear i see i see serpentbearing eagle hail a message a message huitzilopotchli in my soul echoes thy thunderat my intonations the maniac stared incredulously through his odd mask his handsome face shewn in a surprise and perplexity which quickly changed to alarm his mind seemed to go blank a moment and then to recrystallise in another pattern raising his hands aloft he chanted as if in a dreammictlanteuctli great lord a sign a sign from within thy black cave i tonatiuhmetztli cthulhutl command and i servenow in all this responsive gibberish there was one word which struck an odd chord in my memory odd because it never occurs in any printed account of mexican mythology yet had been overheard by me more than once as an awestruck whisper amongst the peons in my own firms tlaxcala mines it seemed to be part of an exceedingly secret and ancient ritual for there were characteristic whispered responses which i had caught now and then and which were as unknown as itself to academic scholarship this maniac must have spent considerable time with the hill peons and indians just as he had said for surely such unrecorded lore could have come from no mere booklearning realising the importance he must attach to this doubly esoteric jargon i determined to strike at his most vulnerable spot and give him the gibberish responses the natives usedyarlyeh yarlyeh i shouted cthulhutl fhtaghn niguratlyig yogsototlbut i never had a chance to finish galvanised into a religious epilepsy by the exact response which his subconscious mind had probably not really expected the madman scrambled down to a kneeling posture on the floor bowing his wirehelmeted head again and again and turning it to the right and left as he did so with each turn his obeisances became more profound and i could hear his foaming lips repeating the syllable kill kill kill in a rapidly swelling monotone it occurred to me that i had overreached myself and that my response had unloosed a mounting mania which would rouse him to the slayingpoint before the train reached the stationas the arc of the madmans turnings gradually increased the slack in the cord from his headpiece to the battery had naturally been taken up more and more now in an allforgetting delirium of ecstasy he began to magnify his turns to complete circles so that the cord wound round his neck and began to tug at its moorings to the battery on the seat i wondered what he would do when the inevitable would happen and the battery would be dragged to presumable destruction on the floorthen came the sudden cataclysm the battery yanked over the seats edge by the maniacs last gesture of orgiastic frenzy did indeed fall but it did not seem to have wholly broken instead as my eye caught the spectacle in one toofleeting instant the actual impact was borne by the rheostat so that the switch was jerked over instantly to full current and the marvellous thing is that therewasa current the invention was no mere dream of insanityi saw a blinding blue auroral coruscation heard an ululating shriek more hideous than any of the previous cries of that mad horrible journey and smelled the nauseous odour of burning flesh that was all my overwrought consciousness could bear and i sank instantly into oblivionwhen the train guard at mexico city revived me i found a crowd on the station platform around my compartment door at my involuntary cry the pressing faces became curious and dubious and i was glad when the guard shut out all but the trim doctor who had pushed his way through to me my cry was a very natural thing but it had been prompted by something more than the shocking sight on the carriage floor which i had expected to see or should say by somethinglessbecause in truth there was not anything on the floor at allnor said the guard had there been when he opened the door and found me unconscious within my ticket was the only one sold for that compartment and i was the only person found within it just myself and my valise nothing more i had been alone all the way from quertaro guard doctor and spectators alike tapped their foreheads significantly at my frantic and insistent questionshad it all been a dream or was i indeed mad i recalled my anxiety and overwrought nerves and shuddered thanking the guard and doctor and shaking free of the curious crowd i staggered into a cab and was taken to the fonda nacional where after telegraphing jackson at the mine i slept till afternoon in an effort to get a fresh grip on myself i had myself called at one oclock in time to catch the narrowgauge for the mining country but when i got up i found a telegram under the door it was from jackson and said that feldon had been found dead in the mountains that morning the news reaching the mine about ten oclock the papers were all safe and the san francisco office had been duly notified so the whole trip with its nervous haste and harrowing mental ordeal had been for nothingknowing that mccomb would expect a personal report despite the course of events i sent another wire ahead and took the narrowgauge after all four hours later i was rattled and jolted into the station of mine no 3 where jackson was waiting to give a cordial greeting he was so full of the affair at the mine that he did not notice my still shaken and seedy appearancethe superintendents story was brief and he told me it as he led me toward the shack up the hillside above thearrastrewhere feldons body lay feldon he said had always been a queer sullen character ever since he was hired the year before working at some secret mechanical device and complaining of constant espionage and being disgustingly familiar with the native workmen but he certainly knew the work the country and the people he used to make long trips into the hills where the peons lived and even to take part in some of their ancient heathenish ceremonies he hinted at odd secrets and strange powers as often as he boasted of his mechanical skill of late he had disintegrated rapidly growing morbidly suspicious of his colleagues and undoubtedly joining his native friends in orethieving after his cash got low he needed unholy amounts of money for something or otherwas always having boxes come from laboratories and machine shops in mexico city or the statesas for the final absconding with all the papersit was only a crazy gesture of revenge for what he called spying he was certainly stark mad for he had gone across country to a hidden cave on the wild slope of the haunted sierra de malinche where no white men live and had done some amazingly queer things the cave which would never have been found but for the final tragedy was full of hideous old aztec idols and altars the latter covered with the charred bones of recent burntofferings of doubtful nature the natives would tell nothingindeed they swore they knew nothingbut it was easy to see that the cave was an old rendezvous of theirs and that feldon had shared their practices to the fullest extentthe searchers had found the place only because of the chanting and the final cry it had been close to five that morning and after an allnight encampment the party had begun to pack up for its emptyhanded return to the mines then somebody had heard faint rhythms in the distance and knew that one of the noxious old native rituals was being howled from some lonely spot up the slope of the corpseshaped mountain they heard the same old namesmictlanteuctli tonatiuhmetzli cthulhutl yarlyeh and all the restbut the queer thing was that some english words were mixed with them real white mans english and no greaser patter guided by the sound they had hastened up the weedentangled mountainside toward it when after a spell of quiet the shriek had burst upon them it was a terrible thinga worse thing than any of them had ever heard before there seemed to be some smoke too and a morbid acrid smellthen they stumbled on the cave its entrance screened by scrub mesquites but now emitting clouds of foetid smoke it was lighted within the horrible altars and grotesque images revealed flickeringly by candles which must have been changed less than a halfhour before and on the gravelly floor lay the horror that made all the crowd reel backward it was feldon head burned to a crisp by some odd device he had slipped over ita kind of wire cage connected with a rather shakenup battery which had evidently fallen to the floor from a nearby altarpot when the men saw it they exchanged glances thinking of the electric executioner feldon had always boasted of inventingthe thing which everyone had rejected but had tried to steal and copy the papers were safe in feldons open portmanteau which stood close by and an hour later the column of searchers started back for no 3 with a grisly burden on an improvised stretcherthat was all but it was enough to make me turn pale and falter as jackson led me up past thearrastreto the shed where he said the body lay for i was not without imagination and knew only too well into what hellish nightmare this tragedy somehow supernaturally dovetailed i knew what i should see inside that gaping door around which the curious miners clustered and did not flinch when my eyes took in the giant form the rough corduroy clothes the oddly delicate hands the wisps of burnt beard and the hellish machine itselfbattery slightly broken and headpiece blackened by the charring of what was inside the great bulging portmanteau did not surprise me and i quailed only at two thingsthe folded sheets of paper sticking out of the lefthand pocket and the queer sagging of the corresponding righthand pocket in a moment when no one was looking i reached out and seized the too familiar sheets crushing them in my hand without daring to look at their penmanship i ought to be sorry now that a kind of panic fear made me burn them that night with averted eyes they would have been a positive proof or disproof of somethingbut for that matter i could still have had proof by asking about the revolver the coroner afterward took from that sagging righthand coat pocket i never had the courage to ask about thatbecause my own revolver was missing after the night on the train my pocket pencil too shewed signs of a crude and hasty sharpening unlike the precise pointing i had given it friday afternoon on the machine in president mccombs private carso in the end i went home still puzzledmercifully puzzled perhaps the private car was repaired when i got back to quertaro but my greatest relief was crossing the rio grande into el paso and the states by the next friday i was in san francisco again and the postponed wedding came off the following weekas to what really happened that nightas ive said i simply dont dare to speculate that chap feldon was insane to start with and on top of his insanity he had piled a lot of prehistoric aztec witchlore that nobody has any right to know he was really an inventive genius and that battery must have been the genuine stuff i heard later how he had been brushed aside in former years by press public and potentates alike too much disappointment isnt good for men of a certain kind anyhow some unholy combination of influences was at work he had really by the way been a soldier of maximilianswhen i tell my story most people call me a plain liar others lay it to abnormal psychologyand heaven knows iwasoverwroughtwhile still others talk of astral projection of some sort my zeal to catch feldon certainly sent my thoughts ahead toward him and with all his indian magic hed be about the first one to recognise and meet them was he in the railway carriage or was i in the cave on the corpseshaped haunted mountain what would have happened to me had i not delayed him as i did ill confess i dont know and im not sure that i want to know ive never been in mexico sinceand as i said at the start i dont enjoy hearing about electric executions,1
i was shewn into the attic chamber by a grave intelligentlooking man with quiet clothes and an irongrey beard who spoke to me in this fashionyeshelived herebut i dont advise your doing anything your curiosity makes you irresponsiblewenever come here at night and its only because ofhiswill that we keep it this way you know whathedid that abominable society took charge at last and we dont know whereheis buried there was no way the law or anything else could reach the societyi hope you wont stay till after dark and i beg of you to let that thing on the tablethe thing that looks like a match boxalone we dont know what it is but we suspect it has something to do with whathedid we even avoid looking at it very steadilyafter a time the man left me alone in the attic room it was very dingy and dusty and only primitively furnished but it had a neatness which shewed it was not a slumdenizens quarters there were shelves full of theological and classical books and another bookcase containing treatises on magicparacelsus albertus magnus trithemius hermes trismegistus borellus and others in strange alphabets whose titles i could not decipher the furniture was very plain there was a door but it led only into a closet the only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude steep staircase led the windows were of bullseye pattern and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity plainly this house was of the old world i seemed to know where i was but cannot recall what i then knew certainly the town wasnotlondon my impression is of a small seaportthe small object on the table fascinated me intensely i seemed to know what to do with it for i drew a pocket electric lightor what looked like oneout of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes the light was not white but violet and seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment i recall that i did not regard it as a common flashlightindeed ihada common flashlight in another pocketit was getting dark and the ancient roofs and chimneypots outside looked very queer through the bullseye windowpanes finally i summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a bookthen turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it the light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a continuous beam as the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange device they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its centre then i noticed that i was not alone in the roomand put the rayprojector back in my pocketbut the newcomer did not speaknor did i hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments everything was shadowy pantomime as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening hazealthough on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close as if both near and distant according to some abnormal geometrythe newcomer was a thin dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church he was apparently about thirty years old with a sallow olive complexion and fairly good features but an abnormally high forehead his black hair was well cut and neatly brushed and he was cleanshaven though bluechinned with a heavy growth of beard he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen but he had a vastly higher forehead and was darker and more intelligentlookingalso more subtly and concealedlyevillooking at the present momenthaving just lighted a faint oil lamphe looked nervous and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room where the wall slanted sharply which i had not noticed before the flames devoured the volumes greedilyleaping up in strange colours and emitting indescribably hideous odours as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element all at once i saw there were others in the roomgravelooking men in clerical costume one of whom wore the bands and kneebreeches of a bishop though i could hear nothing i could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the firstcomer they seemed to hate and fear him at the same time and he seemed to return these sentiments his face set itself into a grim expression but i could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair the bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace where the flames had died down amidst a charred noncommittal mass and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing the firstcomer then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table everyone then seemed frightened the procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor turning and making menacing gestures as they left the bishop was last to gothe firstcomer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope mounting a chair he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak and began making a noose with the other end realising he was about to hang himself i started forward to dissuade or save him he saw me and ceased his preparations looking at me with a kind oftriumphwhich puzzled and disturbed me he slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark thinlipped facei felt somehow in deadly peril and drew out the peculiar rayprojector as a weapon of defence why i thought it could help me i do not know i turned it onfull in his face and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light his expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fearwhich did not however wholly displace the exultation he stopped in his tracksthen flailing his arms wildly in the air began to stagger backward i saw he was edging toward the open stairwell in the floor and tried to shout a warning but he did not hear me in another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to viewi found difficulty in moving toward the stairwell but when i did get there i found no crushed body on the floor below instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tridimensional something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place had there been a noise i had not heard presently the two people simply villagers apparently farthest in the lead saw meand stood paralysed one of them shrieked loudly and reverberentlyahrrh it be ee zur againthen they all turned and fled frantically all that is but one when the crowd was gone i saw the gravebearded man who had brought me to this placestanding alone with a lantern he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly but did not seem afraid then he began to ascend the stairs and joined me in the attic he spokeso youdidntlet it alone im sorry i know what has happened it happened once before but the man got frightened and shot himself you ought not to have madehimcome back you know whathewants but you mustnt get frightened like the other man he got something very strange and terrible has happened to you but it didnt get far enough to hurt your mind and personality if youll keep cool and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life you can keep right on enjoying the world and the fruits of your scholarship but you cant live hereand i dont think youll wish to go back to london id advise americayou mustnt try anything more with thatthing nothing can be put back now it would only make matters worse to door summonanything you are not as badly off as you might bebut you must get out of here at once and stay away youd better thank heaven it didnt go further im going to prepare you as bluntly as i can theres been a certain changein your personal appearancehealways causes that but in a new country you can get used to it theres a mirror up at the other end of the room and im going to take you to it youll get a shockthough you will see nothing repulsivei was now shaking with a deadly fear and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror the faint lamp ie that formerly on the table not the still fainter lantern he had brought in his free hand this is what i saw in the glassa thin dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church apparently about thirty and with rimless steelbowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow olive forehead of abnormal heightit was the silent firstcomer who had burned his booksfor all the rest of my life in outward form i was to be that man,1
when the last days were upon me and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body i loved the irradiate refuge of sleep in my dreams i found a little of the beauty i had vainly sought in life and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woodsonce when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange starsonce when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight iridescent arbours and undying rosesand once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines and pierced by a little gate of bronzemany times i walked through that valley and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral halflight where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk sometimes disclosing the mouldstained stones of buried temples and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vinegrown wall with the little gate of bronze thereinafter a while as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness i would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves and wonder how i might seize them for my eternal dwellingplace so that i need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall i felt that beyond it lay a dreamcountry from which once it was entered there would be no returnso each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall though it was exceedingly well hidden and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely but more lovely and radiant as wellthen one night in the dreamcity of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dreamsages who dwelt of old in that city and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world therein were written many things concerning the world of dream and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate when i saw this lore i knew that it touched on the scenes i had haunted and i therefore read long in the yellowed papyrussome of the dreamsages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate but others told of horror and disappointment i knew not which to believe yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through i resolved to take it when next i awakedlast night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves and when i came this time to the antique wall i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples and i drifted on songfully expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never returnbut as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through i knew that all sights and glories were at an end for in that new realm was neither land nor sea but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space so happier than i had ever dared hoped to be i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and desolate hour,1
ilife is a hideous thing and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous science already oppressive with its shocking revelations will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human speciesif separate species we befor its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world if we knew what we are we should do as sir arthur jermyn did and arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night no one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been for certain papers and a certain boxedobjectwere found which made men wish to forget some who knew him do not admit that he ever existedarthur jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxedobjectwhich had come from africa it was thisobjectand not his peculiar personal appearance which made him end his life many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded learning was in his blood for his greatgrandfather sir robert jermyn bt had been an anthropologist of note whilst his greatgreatgreatgrandfather sir wade jermyn was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region and had written eruditely of its tribes animals and supposed antiquities indeed old sir wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his bookobservations on the several parts of africawas published in 1765 this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdonmadness was in all the jermyns and people were glad there were not many of them the line put forth no branches and arthur was the last of it if he had not been one cannot say what he would have done when theobjectcame the jermyns never seemed to look quite rightsomething was amiss though arthur was the worst and the old family portraits in jermyn house shewed fine faces enough before sir wades time certainly the madness began with sir wade whose wild stories of africa were at once the delight and terror of his few friends it shewed in his collection of trophies and specimens which were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve and appeared strikingly in the oriental seclusion in which he kept his wife the latter he had said was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa and did not like english ways she with an infant son born in africa had accompanied him back from the second and longest of his trips and had gone with him on the third and last never returning no one had ever seen her closely not even the servants for her disposition had been violent and singular during her brief stay at jermyn house she occupied a remote wing and was waited on by her husband alone sir wade was indeed most peculiar in his solicitude for his family for when he returned to africa he would permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman from guinea upon coming back after the death of lady jermyn he himself assumed complete care of the boybut it was the talk of sir wade especially when in his cups which chiefly led his friends to deem him mad in a rational age like the eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild sights and strange scenes under a congo moon of the gigantic walls and pillars of a forgotten city crumbling and vinegrown and of damp silent stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness of abysmal treasurevaults and inconceivable catacombs especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged cityfabulous creatures which even a pliny might describe with scepticism things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars the vaults and the weird carvings yet after he came home for the last time sir wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest mostly after his third glass at the knights head boasting of what he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to him and finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse he had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon for his mind moved curiously ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy he had liked his home less and less till at last he had seemed to dread it the knights head had been his headquarters and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection three years later he diedwade jermyns son philip was a highly peculiar person despite a strong physical resemblance to his father his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned though he did not inherit the madness which was feared by some he was densely stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence in frame he was small but intensely powerful and was of incredible agility twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper a person said to be of gypsy extraction but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor completing the general disgust which his habits and mesalliance had begun after the close of the american war he was heard of as a sailor on a merchantman in the african trade having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the congo coastin the son of sir philip jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange and fatal turn tall and fairly handsome with a sort of weird eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion robert jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator it was he who first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from africa and who made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration in 1815 sir robert married a daughter of the seventh viscount brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three children the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body saddened by these family misfortunes the scientist sought relief in work and made two long expeditions in the interior of africa in 1849 his second son nevil a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of philip jermyn with the hauteur of the brightholmes ran away with a vulgar dancer but was pardoned upon his return in the following year he came back to jermyn house a widower with an infant son alfred who was one day to be the father of arthur jermynfriends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of sir robert jermyn yet it was probably merely a bit of african folklore which caused the disaster the elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the onga tribes near the field of his grandfathers and his own explorations hoping in some way to account for sir wades wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures a certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madmans imagination might have been stimulated by native myths on october 19 1852 the explorer samuel seaton called at jermyn house with a manuscript of notes collected among the ongas believing that certain legends of a grey city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist in his conversation he probably supplied many additional details the nature of which will never be known since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into being when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer and before he could be restrained had put an end to all three of his children the two who were never seen and the son who had run away nevil jermyn died in the successful defence of his own twoyearold son who had apparently been included in the old mans madly murderous scheme sir robert himself after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter any articulate sound died of apoplexy in the second year of his confinementsir alfred jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday but his tastes never matched his title at twenty he had joined a band of musichall performers and at thirtysix had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant american circus his end was very revolting among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers with this gorilla alfred jermyn was singularly fascinated and on many occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars eventually jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal astonishing audiences and fellowperformers alike with his success one morning in chicago as the gorilla and alfred jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match the former delivered a blow of more than usual force hurting both the body and dignity of the amateur trainer of what followed members of the greatest show on earth do not like to speak they did not expect to hear sir alfred jermyn emit a shrill inhuman scream or to see him seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands dash it to the floor of the cage and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat the gorilla was off its guard but not for long and before anything could be done by the regular trainer the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognitioniiarthur jermyn was the son of sir alfred jermyn and a musichall singer of unknown origin when the husband and father deserted his family the mother took the child to jermyn house where there was none left to object to her presence she was not without notions of what a noblemans dignity should be and saw to it that her son received the best education which limited money could provide the family resources were now sadly slender and jermyn house had fallen into woeful disrepair but young arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents he was not like any other jermyn who had ever lived for he was a poet and a dreamer some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old sir wade jermyns unseen portuguese wife declared that her latin blood must be shewing itself but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty attributing it to his musichall mother who was socially unrecognised the poetic delicacy of arthur jermyn was the more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance most of the jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast but arthurs case was very striking it is hard to say just what he resembled but his expression his facial angle and the length of his arms gave a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first timeit was the mind and character of arthur jermyn which atoned for his aspect gifted and learned he took highest honours at oxford and seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family though of poetic rather than scientific temperament he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in african ethnology and antiquities utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of sir wade with his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latters wilder notes and paragraphs for the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his greatgrandfather and samuel seaton amongst the ongasin 1911 after the death of his mother sir arthur jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the congo arranging with the belgian authorities for a party of guides he spent a year in the onga and kaliri country finding data beyond the highest of his expectations among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu who possessed not only a highly retentive memory but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to himaccording to mwanu the grey city and the hybrid creatures were no more having been annihilated by the warlike nbangus many years ago this tribe after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest the white apegoddess which the strange beings worshipped and which was held by congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among those beings just what the white apelike creatures could have been mwanu had no idea but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city jermyn could form no conjecture but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddessthe apeprincess it was said became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the west for a long time they had reigned over the city together but when they had a son all three went away later the god and the princess had returned and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone where it was worshipped then he had departed alone the legend here seemed to present three variants according to one story nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it it was for this reason that the nbangus carried it off a second story told of the gods return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife a third told of the return of the son grown to manhoodor apehood or godhood as the case might beyet unconscious of his identity surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendryof the reality of the jungle city described by old sir wade arthur jermyn had no further doubt and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came upon what was left of it its size must have been exaggerated yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere negro village unfortunately no carvings could be found and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which sir wade had mentioned the white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region but it remained for a european to improve on the data offered by old mwanu m verhaeren belgian agent at a tradingpost on the congo believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess of which he had vaguely heard since the once mighty nbangus were now the submissive servants of king alberts government and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off when jermyn sailed for england therefore it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his greatgreatgreatgrandfathers narrativesthat is the wildest which he had ever heard countrymen near jermyn house had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to sir wade around the tables of the knights headarthur jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from m verhaeren meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor he began to feel closely akin to sir wade and to seek relics of the latters personal life in england as well as of his african exploits oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous but no tangible relic of her stay at jermyn house remained jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement and decided that the husbands insanity was the prime cause his greatgreatgreatgrandmother he recalled was said to have been the daughter of a portuguese trader in africa no doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the dark continent had caused her to flout sir wades talk of the interior a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive she had died in africa perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told but as jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility a century and a half after the death of both of his strange progenitorsin june 1913 a letter arrived from m verhaeren telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess it was the belgian averred a most extraordinary object an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition time and the congo climate are not kind to mummies especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here around the creatures neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs no doubt some hapless travellers keepsake taken by the nbangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm in commenting on the contour of the mummys face m verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison or rather expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his correspondent but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity the stuffed goddess he wrote would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letterthe boxed object was delivered at jermyn house on the afternoon of august 3 1913 being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of african specimens as arranged by sir robert and arthur what ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined of the various tales that of aged soames the family butler is most ample and coherent according to this trustworthy man sir arthur jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box though the instant sound of hammer and chisel shewed that he did not delay the operation nothing was heard for some time just how long soames cannot exactly estimate but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream undoubtedly in jermyns voice was heard immediately afterward jermyn emerged from the room rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy the expression on his face a face ghastly enough in repose was beyond description when near the front door he seemed to think of something and turned back in his flight finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar the servants were utterly dumbfounded and watched at the head of the stairs but their master did not return a smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below after dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard and a stableboy saw arthur jermyn glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house then in an exaltation of supreme horror everyone saw the end a spark appeared on the moor a flame arose and a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens the house of jermyn no longer existedthe reason why arthur jermyns charred fragments were not collected and buried lies in what was found afterward principally the thing in the box the stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight withered and eaten away but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species less hairy than any recorded variety and infinitely nearer mankindquite shockingly so detailed description would be rather unpleasant but two salient particulars must be told for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of sir wade jermyns african expeditions and with the congolese legends of the white god and the apeprincess the two particulars in question are these the arms on the golden locket about the creatures neck were the jermyn arms and the jocose suggestion of m verhaeren about a certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid ghastly and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive arthur jermyn greatgreatgreatgrandson of sir wade jermyn and an unknown wife members of the royal anthropological institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well and some of them do not admit that arthur jermyn ever existed,1
efficiunt daemones ut quae non sunt sic tamenquasi sint conspicienda hominibus exhibeantlactantiusi was far from home and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me in the twilight i heard it pounding on the rocks and i knew it lay just over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening and because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond i pushed on through the shallow newfallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to where aldebaran twinkled among the trees on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but often dreamed ofit was the yuletide that men call christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon older than memphis and mankind it was the yuletide and i had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten mine were an old people and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before and they were strange because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blueeyed fishers and now they were scattered and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand i was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade for only the poor and the lonely rememberthen beyond the hills crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples ridgepoles and chimneypots wharves and small bridges willowtrees and graveyards endless labyrinths of steep narrow crooked streets and dizzy churchcrowned central peak that time durst not touch ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a childs disordered blocks antiquity hovering on grey wings over winterwhitened gables and gambrel roofs fanlights and smallpaned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join orion and the archaic stars and against the rotting wharves the sea pounded the secretive immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder timebeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose bleak and windswept and i saw that it was a buryingground where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse the printless road was very lonely and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in 1692 but i did not know just whereas the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry sounds of a village at evening but did not hear them then i thought of the season and felt that these old puritan folk might well have christmas customs strange to me and full of silent hearthside prayer so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers but kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and seataverns creaked in the salt breeze and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little curtained windowsi had seen maps of the town and knew where to find the home of my people it was told that i should be known and welcomed for village legend lives long so i hastened through back street to circle court and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town to where green lane leads off behind the market house the old maps still held good and i had no trouble though at arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place since i saw not a wire overhead snow would have hid the rails in any case i was glad i had chosen to walk for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill and now i was eager to knock at the door of my people the seventh house on the left in green lane with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second story all built before 1650there were lights inside the house when i came upon it and i saw from the diamond windowpanes that it must have been kept very close to its antique state the upper part overhung the narrow grassgrown street and nearly met the overhanging part of the house opposite so that i was almost in a tunnel with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow there was no sidewalk but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings it was an odd scene and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before though it pleased me i would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow and people in the streets and a few windows without drawn curtainswhen i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid some fear had been gathering in me perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage and the bleakness of the evening and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs and when my knock was answered i was fully afraid because i had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open but i was not afraid long for the gowned slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me and though he made signs that he was dumb he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carriedhe beckoned me into a low candlelit room with massive exposed rafters and dark stiff sparse furniture of the seventeenth century the past was vivid there for not an attribute was missing there was a cavernous fireplace and a spinningwheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep pokebonnet sat back toward me silently spinning despite the festive season an indefinite dampness seemed upon the place and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing the highbacked settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left and seemed to be occupied though i was not sure i did not like everything about what i saw and felt again the fear i had had this fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it for the more i looked at the old mans bland face the more its very blandness terrified me the eyes never moved and the skin was too like wax finally i was sure it was not a face at all but a fiendishly cunning mask but the flabby hands curiously gloved wrote genially on the tablet and told me i must wait a while before i could be led to the place of festivalpointing to a chair table and pile of books the old man now left the room and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and mouldy and that they included old morrysters wildmarvells of sciencethe terriblesaducismus triumphatusof joseph glanvill published in 1681 the shockingdaemonolatreiaof remigius printed in 1595 at lyons and worst of all the unmentionablenecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius forbidden latin translation a book which i had never seen but of which i had heard monstrous things whispered no one spoke to me but i could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning spinning i thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings i resolved to expect queer things so i tried to read and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursednecronomicona thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced as if it had been stealthily opened it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old womans spinningwheel this was not much though for the old woman was spinning very hard and the aged clock had been striking after that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume and sat down on that very bench so that i could not see him it was certainly nervous waiting and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so when eleven struck however the old man stood up glided to a massive carved chest in a corner and got two hooded cloaks one of which he donned and the other of which he draped round the old woman who was ceasing her monotonous spinning then they both started for the outer door the woman lamely creeping and the old man after picking up the very book i had been reading beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or maskwe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient town went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one and the dog star leered at the throng of cowled cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that past the creaking signs and antediluvian gables the thatched roofs and diamondpaned windows threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellationsamid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy but seeing never a face and hearing never a word up up up the eerie columns slithered and i saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town where perched a great white church i had seen it from the roads crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk and it had made me shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spirethere was an open space around the church partly a churchyard with spectral shafts and partly a halfpaved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables deathfires danced over the tombs revealing gruesome vistas though queerly failing to cast any shadows past the churchyard where there were no houses i could see over the hills summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour though the town was invisible in the dark only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church i waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway and till all the stragglers had followed the old man was pulling at my sleeve but i was determined to be the last then i finally went the sinister man and the old spinning woman before me crossing the threshold into that swarming temple of unknown darkness i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement and as i did so i shuddered for though the wind had not left much snow a few patches did remain on the path near the door and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet not even minethe church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it for most of the throng had already vanished they had streamed up the aisle between the high white pews to the trapdoor of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit and were now squirming noiselessly in i followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the dank suffocating crypt the tail of that sinuous line of nightmarchers seemed very horrible and as i saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still then i noticed that the tombs floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of roughhewn stone a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar it was a silent shocking descent and i observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature as if chiselled out of the solid rock what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes after more aeons of descent i saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery soon they became excessively numerous like impious catacombs of nameless menace and their pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evilthen i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters again i shivered for i did not like the things that the night had brought and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite as the steps and the passage grew broader i heard another sound the thin whining mockery of a feeble flute and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner worlda vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial oceanfainting and gasping i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan toadstools leprous fire and slimy water and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar it was the yulerite older than man and fated to survive him the primal rite of the solstice and of springs promise beyond the snows the rite of fire and evergreen light and music and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the rite and adore the sick pillar of flame and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare i saw this and i saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light piping noisomely on a flute and as the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where i could not see but what frightened me most was that flaming column spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable casting no shadows as healthy flame should and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty venomous verdigris for in all that seething combustion no warmth lay but only the clamminess of death and corruptionthe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he faced at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance especially when he held above his head that abhorrentnecronomiconhe had taken with him and i shared all the obeisances because i had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers then the old man made a signal to the halfseen fluteplayer in the darkness which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world but only of the mad spaces between the starsout of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny unheard and unsuspected there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame trained hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp or sound brain ever wholly remember they were not altogether crows nor moles nor buzzards nor ants nor vampire bats nor decomposed human beings but something i cannot and must not recall they flopped limply along half with their webbed feet and half with their membraneous wings and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataractsthe old spinning woman had gone with the throng and the old man remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest i saw when i staggered to my feet that the amorphous fluteplayer had rolled out of sight but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by as i hung back the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place that it had been decreed i should come back and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed he wrote this in a very ancient hand and when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch both with my family arms to prove that he was what he said but it was a hideous proof because i knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather in 1698presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face but i only shuddered because i was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask the flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the lichens and i saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself when one of the things began to waddle and edge away he turned quickly to stop it so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head and then because that nightmares position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come i flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea flung myself into that putrescent juice of earths inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pestgulfs might concealat the hospital they told me i had been found half frozen in kingsport harbour at dawn clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before and fallen over the cliffs at orange point a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow there was nothing i could say because everything was wrong everything was wrong with the broad window shewing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below they insisted that this was kingsport and i could not deny it when i went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on central hill they sent me to st marys hospital in arkham where i could have better care i liked it there for the doctors were broadminded and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazreds objectionablenecronomiconfrom the library of miskatonic university they said something about a psychosis and agreed i had better get any harassing obsessions off my mindso i read again that hideous chapter and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me i had seen it before let footprints tell what they might and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten there was no onein waking hourswho could remind me of it but my dreams are filled with terror because of phrases i dare not quote i dare quote only one paragraph put into such english as i can make from the awkward low latinthe nethermost caverns wrote the mad arab are not for the fathoming of eyes that see for their marvels are strange and terrific cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied and evil the mind that is held by no head wisely did ibn schacabac say that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes for it is of old rumour that the soul of the devilbought hastes not from his charnel clay but fats and instructsthe very worm that gnawstill out of corruption horrid life springs and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it great holes secretly are digged where earths pores ought to suffice and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl,1
horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend crawford tillinghast i had not seen him since that day two months and a half before when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage i had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine eating little and excluding even the servants but i had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature it is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed the eyes sunken circled and uncannily glowing the forehead veined and corrugated and the hands tremulous and twitching and if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness a wild disorder of dress a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once cleanshaven the cumulative effect is quite shocking but such was the aspect of crawford tillinghast on the night his halfcoherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me candle in hand and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient lonely house set back from benevolent streetthat crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake these things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action despair if he fail in his quest and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed tillinghast had once been the prey of failure solitary and melancholy but now i knew with nauseating fears of my own that he was the prey of success i had indeed warned him ten weeks before when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover he had been flushed and excited then talking in a high and unnatural though always pedantic voicewhat do we know he had said of the world and the universe about us our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow we see things only as we are constructed to see them and can gain no idea of their absolute nature with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos yet other beings with a wider stronger or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see but might see and study whole worlds of matter energy and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have i have always believed that such strange inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbowsand now i believe i have found a way to break down the barriersi am not joking within twentyfour hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised senseorgans that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life we shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight we shall see these things and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen we shall overleap time space and dimensions and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creationwhen tillinghast said these things i remonstrated for i knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused but he was a fanatic and drove me from the house now he was no less a fanatic but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment and he had written me imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognise as i entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle i became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light and i sickened at the hollow altered voice of my host i wished the servants were about and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously it seemed strange that old gregory at least should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rageyet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could only guess but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart i could not doubt before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit terrible though the cost of victory appeared up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man the electricity seemed to be turned off and when i asked my guide he said it was for a definite reasonit would be too much i would not dare he continued to mutter i especially noted his new habit of muttering for it was not like him to talk to himself we entered the laboratory in the attic and i observed that detestable electrical machine glowing with a sickly sinister violet luminosity it was connected with a powerful chemical battery but seemed to be receiving no current for i recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action in reply to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that i could understandhe now seated me near the machine so that it was on my right and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs the usual sputtering began turned to a whine and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence meanwhile the luminosity increased waned again then assumed a pale outr colour or blend of colours which i could neither place nor describe tillinghast had been watching me and noted my puzzled expressiondo you know what that is he whispered that is ultraviolet he chuckled oddly at my surprise you thought ultraviolet was invisible and so it isbut you can see that and many other invisible thingsnowlisten to me the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity i have seentruthand i intend to shew it to you do you wonder how it will seem i will tell you here tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes your existing senseorgansears first i thinkwill pick up many of the impressions for they are closely connected with the dormant organs then there will be others you have heard of the pineal gland i laugh at the shallow endocrinologist fellowdupe and fellowparvenu of the freudian that gland is the great senseorgan of organsi have found outit is like sight in the end and transmits visual pictures to the brain if you are normal that is the way you ought to get most of it i mean get most of the evidence frombeyondi looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall dimly lit by rays which the everyday eye cannot see the far corners were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm during the interval that tillinghast was silent i fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of longdead gods some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision the picture was very vivid for a while but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception that of utter absolute solitude in infinite sightless soundless space there seemed to be a void and nothing more and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver i always carried after dark since the night i was held up in east providence then from the farthermost regions of remoteness thesoundsoftly glided into existence it was infinitely faint subtly vibrant and unmistakably musical but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound as i waited breathlessly i perceived that both sound and wind were increasing the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive i began to speak to tillinghast and as i did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished i saw only the man the glowing machine and the dim apartment tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i if not a great deal more i whispered what i had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possibledont move he cautioned for in these rayswe are able to be seen as well as to seei told you the servants left but i didnt tell youhowit was that thickwitted housekeepershe turned on the lights downstairs after i had warned her not to and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations it must have been frightfuli could hear the screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hearing from another direction and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house mrs updikes clothes were close to the front hall switchthats how i know she did it it got them all but so long as we dont move were fairly safe remember were dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless keep stillthe combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what tillinghast called beyond i was now in a vortex of sound and motion with confused pictures before my eyes i saw the blurred outlines of the room but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognisable shapes or clouds penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me then i glimpsed the templelike effect again but this time the pillars reached up into an arial ocean of light which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen before after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic and in the jumble of sights sounds and unidentified senseimpressions i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form one definite flash i shall always remember i seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining revolving spheres and as it receded i saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape this shape being the distorted face of crawford tillinghast at another time i felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionallywalking or drifting through my supposedly solid bodyand thought i saw tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually i recalled what he had said of the pineal gland and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eyesuddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which though vague held the elements of consistency and permanence it was indeed somewhat familiar for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre i saw the attic laboratory the electrical machine and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien unknown entities it likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa foremost among the living objects were great inky jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine they were present in loathsome profusion and i saw to my horror that theyoverlappedthat they were semifluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids these things were never still but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose sometimes they appeared to devour one another the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants and could not exclude the things from my mind as i strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us but tillinghast had been watching me and was speakingyou see them you see them you see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life you see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky have i not succeeded in breaking down the barrier have i not shewn you worlds that no other living men have seen i heard him scream through the horrible chaos and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine his eyes were pits of flame and they glared at me with what i now saw was overwhelming hatred the machine droned detestablyyou think those floundering things wiped out the servants fool they are harmless but the servantsaregone arent they you tried to stop me you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i could get you were afraid of the cosmic truth you damned coward but now ive got you what swept up the servants what made them scream so loud dont know eh youll know soon enough look at melisten to what i saydo you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude do you fancy there are such things as form or matter i tell you i have struck depths that your little brain cant picture i have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars i have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness space belongs to me do you hear things are hunting me nowthe things that devour and dissolvebut i know how to elude them it is you they will get as they got the servants stirring dear sir i told you it was dangerous to move i have saved you so far by telling you to keep stillsaved you to see more sights and to listen to me if you had moved they would have been at you long ago dont worry they wonthurtyou they didnt hurt the servantsit wasseeingthat made the poor devils scream so my pets are not pretty for they come out of places where aesthetic standards arevery differentdisintegration is quite painless i assure youbuti want you to see themi almost saw them but i knew how to stop you are not curious i always knew you were no scientist trembling eh trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things i have discovered why dont you move then tired well dont worry my friendfor they are coming look look curse you look its just over your left shoulder what remains to be told is very brief and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast house and found us theretillinghast dead and me unconscious they arrested me because the revolver was in my hand but released me in three hours after they found it was apoplexy which had finished tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor i did not tell very much of what i had seen for i feared the coroner would be sceptical but from the evasive outline i did give the doctor told me that i had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madmani wish i could believe that doctor it would help my shaky nerves if i could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me i never feel alone or comfortable and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary what prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple factthat the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast murdered,1
imoonmadness a touch of fever i wish i could think so but when i am alone after dark in the waste places where my wanderings take me and hear across infinite voids the demon echoes of those screams and snarls and that detestable crunching of bones i shudder again at the memory of that eldritch nighti knew less of woodcraft in those days though the wilderness called just as strongly to me as it does now up to that night i had always been careful to employ a guide but circumstances now suddenly forced me to a trial of my own skill it was midsummer in maine and despite my great need to get from mayfair to glendale by the next noon i could find no person willing to pilot me unless i took the long route through potowisset which would not bring me to my goal in time there would be dense forests to penetrate yet whenever i asked for a guide i was met with refusal and evasionstranger that i was it seemed odd that everyone should have glib excuses there was too much important business on hand for such a sleepy village and i knew that the natives were lying but they all had imperative duties or said that they had and would do no more than assure me that the trail through the woods was very plain running due north and not in the least difficult for a vigorous young fellow if i started while the morning was still early they averred i could get to glendale by sundown and avoid a night in the open even then i suspected nothing the prospect seemed good and i resolved to try it alone let the lazy villagers hang back as they might probably i would have tried it even if i had suspected for youth is stubborn and from childhood i had only laughed at superstition and old wives talesso before the sun was high i had started off through the trees at a swinging stride lunch in my hand guardian automatic in my pocket and belt filled with crisp bills of large denominations from the distances given me and a knowledge of my own speed i had figured on making glendale a little after sunset but i knew that even if detained over night through some miscalculation i had plenty of camping experience to fall back on besides my presence at my destination was not really necessary till the following noonit was the weather that set my plans awry as the sun rose higher it scorched through even the thickest of the foliage and burned up my energy at every step by noon my clothes were soaking with perspiration and i felt myself faltering in spite of all my resolution as i pushed deeper into the woods i found the trail greatly obstructed with underbrush and at many points nearly effaced it must have been weeksperhaps monthssince anyone had broken his way through and i began to wonder if i could after all live up to my scheduleat length having grown very hungry i looked for the deepest patch of shade i could find and proceeded to eat the lunch which the hotel had prepared for me there were some indifferent sandwiches a piece of stale pie and a bottle of very light wine by no means sumptuous fare but welcome enough to one in my state of overheated exhaustionit was too hot for smoking to be of any solace so i did not take out my pipe instead i stretched myself at full length under the trees when my meal was done intent on stealing a few moments rest before commencing the last lap of my journey i suppose i was a fool to drink that wine for light though it was it proved just enough to finish the work the sultry oppressive day had begun my plan called for the merest momentary relaxation yet with scarcely a warning yawn i dropped off into a sound slumberiiwhen i opened my eyes twilight was closing in about me a wind fanned my cheeks restoring me quickly to full perception and as i glanced up at the sky i saw with apprehension that black racing clouds were leading on a solid wall of darkness prophetic of violent thunderstorm i knew now that i could not reach glendale before morning but the prospect of a night in the woodsmy first night of lone forest campingbecame very repugnant under these trying conditions in a moment i decided to push along for a while at least in the hope of finding some shelter before the tempest should breakdarkness spread over the woods like a heavy blanket the lowering clouds grew more threatening and the wind increased to a veritable gale a flash of distant lightning illuminated the sky followed by an ominous rumble that seemed to hint of malign pursuit then i felt a drop of rain on my outstretched hand and though still walking on automatically resigned myself to the inevitable another moment and i had seen the light the light of a window through the trees and the darkness eager only for shelter i hastened toward itwould to god i had turned and fledthere was a sort of imperfect clearing on the farther side of which with its back against the primeval wood stood a building i had expected a shanty or logcabin but stopped short in surprise when i beheld a neat and tasteful little house of two stories some seventy years old by its architecture yet still in a state of repair betokening the closest and most civilized attention through the small panes of one of the lower windows a bright light shone and toward thisspurred by the impact of another raindropi presently hurried across the clearing rapping loudly on the doors as soon as i gained the stepswith startling promptness my knock was answered by a deep pleasant voice which uttered the single syllable comepushing open the unlocked door i entered a shadowy hall lighted by an open doorway at the right beyond which was a booklined room with the gleaming window as i closed the outer door behind me i could not help noticing a peculiar odor about the house a faint elusive scarcely definable odor which somehow suggested animals my host i surmised must be a hunter or trapper with his business conducted on the premisesthe man who had spoken sat in a capacious easychair beside a marbletopped center table a long loungingrobe of gray swathing his lean form the light from a powerful argand lamp threw his features into prominence and as he eyed me curiously i studied him in no less detail he was strikingly handsome with thin cleanshaven face glossy flaxen hair neatly brushed long regular eyebrows that met in a slanting angle above the nose shapely ears set low and well back on the head and large expressive gray eyes almost luminous in their animation when he smiled a welcome he showed a magnificently even set of firm white teeth and as he waved me to a chair i was struck by the fineness of his slender hands with their long tapering fingers whose ruddy almondshaped nails were slightly curved and exquisitely manicured i could not help wondering why a man of such engaging personality should choose the life of a reclusesorry to intrude i ventured but ive given up the hope of making glendale before morning and theres a storm coming on which sent me looking for cover as if to corroborate my words there came at this point a vivid flash a crashing reverberation and the first breaking of a torrential downpour that beat maniacally against the windowsmy host seemed oblivious to the elements and flashed me another smile when he answered his voice was soothing and well modulated and his eyes held a calmness almost hypnoticyoure welcome to whatever hospitality i can offer but im afraid it wont be much ive a game leg so youll have to do most of the waiting on yourself if youre hungry youll find plenty in the kitchenplenty of food if not of ceremony it seemed to me that i could detect the slightest trace of a foreign accent in his tone though his language was fluently correct and idiomaticrising to an impressive height he headed for the door with long limping steps and i noticed the huge hairy arms that hung at his side in such curious contrast with his delicate handscome he suggested bring the lamp along with you i might as well sit in the kitchen as herei followed him into the hall and the room across it and at his direction ransacked the woodpile in the corner and the cupboard on the wall a few moments later when the fire was going nicely i asked him if i might not prepare food for both but he courteously declinedits too hot to eat he told me besides i had a bite before you cameafter washing the dishes left from my lone meal i sat down for a while smoking my pipe contentedly my host asked a few questions about the neighboring villages but lapsed into sullen taciturnity when he learned i was an outsider as he brooded there silently i could not help feeling a quality of strangeness in him some subtle alienage that could hardly be analyzed i was quite certain for one thing that he was tolerating me because of the storm rather than welcoming me with genuine hospitalityas for the storm it seemed almost to have spent itself outside it was already growing lighterfor there was a full moon behind the cloudsand the rain had dwindled to a trivial drizzle perhaps i thought i could now resume my journey after all an idea which i suggested to my hostbetter wait till morning he remarked you say youre afoot and its a good three hours to glendale ive two bedrooms upstairs and youre welcome to one of them if you care to staythere was a sincerity in his invitation which dispelled any doubts i had held regarding his hospitality and i now concluded that his silences must be the result of long isolation from his fellows in this wilderness after sitting without a word through three fillings of my pipe i finally began to yawnits been rather a strenuous day for me i admitted and i guess id better be making tracks for bed i want to be up at sunrise you know and on my waymy host waved his arm toward the door through which i could see the hall and the staircasetake the lamp with you he instructed its the only one i have but i dont mind sitting in the dark really half the time i dont light it at all when im alone oil is so hard to get out here and i go to the village so seldom your room is the one on the right at the head of the stairstaking the lamp and turning in the hall to say goodnight i could see his eyes glowing almost phosphorescently in the darkened room i had left and i was half reminded for a moment of the jungle and the circles of eyes that sometimes glow just beyond the radius of the campfire then i started upstairsas i reached the second floor i could hear my host limping across the hall to the other room below and perceived that he moved with owlish sureness despite the darkness truly he had but little need of the lamp the storm was over and as i entered the room assigned me i found it bright with the rays of a full moon that streamed on the bed from an uncurtained south window blowing out the lamp and leaving the house in darkness but for the moonbeams i sniffed at the pungent odor that rose above the scent of the kerosenethe quasianimal odor i had noticed on first entering the place i crossed to the window and threw it wide breathing deep of the cool fresh night airwhen i started to undress i paused almost instantly recalling my money belt still in its place about my waist possibly i reflected it would be well not to be too hasty or unguarded for i had read of men who seized just such an opportunity to rob and even to murder the stranger within their dwelling so arranging the bedclothes to look as if they covered a sleeping figure i drew the rooms only chair into the concealing shadows filled and lighted my pipe again and sat down to rest or watch as the occasion might demandiiii could not have been sitting there long when my sensitive ears caught the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs all the old lore of robber landlords rushed on me afresh when another moment revealed that the steps were plain loud and careless with no attempt at concealment while my hosts tread as i had heard it from the head of the staircase was a soft limping stride shaking the ashes from my pipe i slipped it in my pocket then seizing and drawing my automatic i rose from the chair tiptoed across the room and crouched tensely in a spot which the opening door would coverthe door opened and into the shaft of moonlight stepped a man i had never seen before tall broadshouldered and distinguished his face half hidden by a heavy squarecut beard and his neck buried in a high black stock of a pattern long obsolete in america he was indubitably a foreigner how he could have entered the house without my knowledge was quite beyond me nor could i believe for an instant that he had been concealed in either of the two rooms or the hall below me as i gazed intently at him in the insidious moonbeams it seemed to me that i could see directly through his sturdy form but perhaps this was only an illusion that came from my shock of surprisenoticing the disarray of the bed but evidently missing the intended effect of occupancy the stranger muttered something to himself in a foreign tongue and proceeded to disrobe flinging his clothes into the chair i had vacated he crept into bed pulled the covers over him and in a moment or two was breathing with the regular respiration of a sound sleepermy first thought was to seek out my host and demand an explanation but a second later i deemed it better to make sure that the whole incident was not a mere delusive aftereffect of my winedrugged sleep in the woods i still felt weak and faint and despite my recent supper was as hungry as if i had not eaten since that noonday lunchi crossed to the bed reached out and grasped at the shoulder of the sleeping man then barely checking a cry of mad fright and dizzy astonishment i fell back with pounding pulse and dilated eyesfor my clutching fingers had passed directly through the sleeping form and seized only the sheet belowa complete analysis of my jarred and jumbled sensations would be futile the man was intangible yet i could still see him there hear his regular breathing and watch his figure as it half turned beneath the clothes and then as i was quite certain of my own madness or hypnosis i heard other footsteps on the stairs soft padded doglike limping footsteps pattering up up up and again that pungent animal smell this time in redoubled volume dazed and dreamdrowsed i crept once more behind the protecting opened door shaken to the marrow but now resigned to any fate known or namelessthen into that shaft of eerie moonlight stepped the gaunt form of a great gray wolf limped i should have said for one hind foot was held in the air as though wounded by some stray shot the beast turned its head in my direction and as it did so the pistol dropped from my twitching fingers and clattered unheeded to the floor the ascending succession of horrors was fast paralyzing my will and consciousness forthe eyes that now glared toward me from that hellish head were the gray phosphorescent eyes of my host as they had peered at me through the darkness of the kitcheni do not yet know whether it saw me the eyes turned from my direction to the bed and gazed gluttonously on the spectral sleeping form there then the head tilted back and from that demon throat came the most shocking ululation i have ever heard a thick nauseous lupine howl that made my heart stand still the form on the bed stirred opened his eyes and shrank from what he saw the animal crouched quivering and thenas the ethereal figure uttered a shriek of mortal human anguish and terror that no ghost of legend could counterfeitsprang straight for its victims throat its white firm even teeth flashing in the moonlight as they closed on the jugular vein of the screaming phantasm the scream ended in a bloodchoked gurgle and the frightened human eyes turned glassythat scream had roused me to action and in a second i had retrieved my automatic and emptied its entire contents into the wolfish monstrosity before mebut i heard the unhindered thud of each bullet as it imbedded itself in the opposite wallmy nerves gave way blind fear hurled me toward the door and blind fear prompted the one backward glance in which i saw that the wolf had sunk its teeth into the body of its quarry then came that culminating sensory impression and the devastating thought to which it gave birth this was the same body i had thrust my handthrougha few moments before and yet as i plunged down that black nightmare staircasei could hear the crunching of bonesivhow i found the trail to glendale or how i managed to traverse it i suppose i shall never know i only know that sunrise found me on the hill at the edge of the woods with the steepled village outspread below me and the blue thread of the cataqua sparkling in the distance hatless coatless ashenfaced and as soaked with perspiration as if i had spent the night abroad in the storm i hesitated to enter the village till i had recovered at least some outward semblance of composure at last i picked my way down hill and through the narrow streets with their flagstone sidewalks and colonial doorways till i reached the lafayette house whose proprietor eyed me askancewhere from so early son and why the wild lookive just come through the woods from mayfairyoucamethroughthe devils woodslast nightandalone the old man stared with a queer look of alternate horror and incredulitywhy not i countered i couldnt have made it in time through potowisset and i had to be here not later than this noonand last night wasfull moon my gawd he eyed me curiously see anything of vasili oukranikov or the countsay do i look that simple what are you trying to dojolly mebut his tone was as grave as a priests as he replied you must be new to these parts sonny if you werent youd know all about devils woods and the full moon and vasili and the resti felt anything but flippant yet knew i must not seem serious after my earlier remarks go oni know youre dying to tell me im like a donkeyall earsthen he told the legend in his dry way stripping it of vitality and convincingness through lack of coloring detail and atmosphere but for me it needed no vitality or convincingness that any poet could have given remember what i had witnessed and remember that i had never heard of the tale untilafteri had had the experience and fled from the terror of those crunched phantom bonesthere used to be quite a few russians scattered betwixt here and mayfairthey came after one of their nihilist troubles back in russia vasili oukranikov was one of ema tall thin handsome chap with shiny yellow hair and a wonderful manner they said though that he was a servant of the devila werewolf and eater of menhe built him a house in the woods about a third of the way from here to mayfair and lived all alone every once in a while a traveler would come out of the woods with some pretty strange tale about being chased by a big wolf with shining human eyeslike oukranikovs one night somebody took a pot shot at the wolf and the next time the russian came into glendale he walked with a limp that settled it there wasnt any mere suspicion now but hard factsthen he sent to mayfair for the counthis name was feodor tchernevsky and he had bought the old gambrelroofed fowler place up state streetto come out and see him they all warned the count for he was a fine man and a splendid neighbor but he said he could take care of himself all right it was the night of the full moon he was brave as they make em and all he did was to tell some men he had around the place to follow him to vasilis if he didnt show up in decent time they didand you tell me sonny that youve been through those woods at nightsure i tell youi tried to appear nonchalantim no count and here i am to tell the tale but what did the men find at oukranikovs housethey found the counts mangled body sonny and a gaunt gray wolf hovering over it with bloodslavering jaws you can guess who the wolf was and folks do say that at every full moonbut sonny didnt you see or hear anythingnot a thing pop and say what became of the wolfor vasili oukranikovwhy son they killed itfilled it full of lead and buried it in the house and then burned the place downyou know all this was sixty years ago when i was a little shaver but i remember it as if twas yesterdayi turned away with a shrug of my shoulders it was all so quaint and silly and artificial in the full light of day but sometimes when i am alone after dark in waste places and hear the demon echoes of those screams and snarls and that detestable crunching of bones i shudder again at the memory of that eldritch night,1
translated by elizabeth neville berkeley and lewis theobald junintroductory note the following very singular narrative or record of impressions was discovered under circumstances so extraordinary that they deserve careful description on the evening of wednesday august 27 1913 at about 830 oclock the population of the small seaside village of potowonket maine usa was aroused by a thunderous report accompanied by a blinding flash and persons near the shore beheld a mammoth ball of fire dart from the heavens into the sea but a short distance out sending up a prodigious column of water the following sunday a fishing party composed of john richmond peter b carr and simon canfield caught in their trawl and dragged ashore a mass of metallic rock weighing 360 pounds and looking as mr canfield said like a piece of slag most of the inhabitants agreed that this heavy body was none other than the fireball which had fallen from the sky four days before and dr richmond m jones the local scientific authority allowed that it must be an aerolite or meteoric stone in chipping off specimens to send to an expert boston analyst dr jones discovered imbedded in the semimetallic mass the strange book containing the ensuing tale which is still in his possessionin form the discovery resembles an ordinary notebook about 5 3 inches in size and containing thirty leaves in material however it presents marked peculiarities the covers are apparently of some dark stony substance unknown to geologists and unbreakable by any mechanical means no chemical reagent seems to act upon them the leaves are much the same save that they are lighter in colour and so infinitely thin as to be quite flexible the whole is bound by some process not very clear to those who have observed it a process involving the adhesion of the leaf substance to the cover substance these substances cannot now be separated nor can the leaves be torn by any amount of force the writing isgreek of the purest classical qualityand several students of palaeography declare that the characters are in a cursive hand used about the second century b c there is little in the text to determine the date the mechanical mode of writing cannot be deduced beyond the fact that it must have resembled that of the modern slate and slatepencil during the course of analytical efforts made by the late prof chambers of harvard several pages mostly at the conclusion of the narrative were blurred to the point of utter effacement before being read a circumstance forming a wellnigh irreparable loss what remains of the contents was done into modern greek letters by the palaeographer rutherford and in this form submitted to the translatorsprof mayfield of the massachusetts institute of technology who examined samples of the strange stone declares it a true meteorite an opinion in which dr von winterfeldt of heidelberg interned in 1918 as a dangerous enemy alien does not concur prof bradley of columbia college adopts a less dogmatic ground pointing out that certain utterly unknown ingredients are present in large quantities and warning that no classification is as yet possiblethe presence nature and message of the strange book form so momentous a problem that no explanation can even be attempted the text as far as preserved is here rendered as literally as our language permits in the hope that some reader may eventually hit upon an interpretation and solve one of the greatest scientific mysteries of recent yearsenblt junthe storyit was a narrow place and i was alone on one side beyond a margin of vivid waving green was the sea blue bright and billowy and sending up vaporous exhalations which intoxicated me so profuse indeed were these exhalations that they gave me an odd impression of a coalescence of sea and sky for the heavens were likewise bright and blue on the other side was the forest ancient almost as the sea itself and stretching infinitely inland it was very dark for the trees were grotesquely huge and luxuriant and incredibly numerous their giant trunks were of a horrible green which blended weirdly with the narrow green tract whereon i stood at some distance away on either side of me the strange forest extended down to the waters edge obliterating the shore line and completely hemming in the narrow tract some of the trees i observed stood in the water itself as though impatient of any barrier to their progressi saw no living thing nor sign that any living thing save myself had ever existed the sea and the sky and the wood encircled me and reached off into regions beyond my imagination nor was there any sound save of the windtossed wood and of the seaas i stood in this silent place i suddenly commenced to tremble for though i knew not how i came there and could scarce remember what my name and rank had been i felt that i should go mad if i could understand what lurked about me i recalled things i had learned things i had dreamed things i had imagined and yearned for in some other distant life i thought of long nights when i had gazed up at the stars of heaven and cursed the gods that my free soul could not traverse the vast abysses which were inaccessible to my body i conjured up ancient blasphemies and terrible delvings into the papyri of democritus but as memories appeared i shuddered in deeper fear for i knew that i was alonehorribly alone alone yet close to sentient impulses of vast vague kind which i prayed never to comprehend nor encounter in the voice of the swaying green branches i fancied i could detect a kind of malignant hatred and daemoniac triumph sometimes they struck me as being in horrible colloquy with ghastly and unthinkable things which the scaly green bodies of the trees half hid hid from sight but not from consciousness the most oppressive of my sensations was a sinister feeling of alienage though i saw about me objects which i could nametrees grass sea and sky i felt that their relation to me was not the same as that of the trees grass sea and sky i knew in another and dimly remembered life the nature of the difference i could not tell yet i shook in stark fright as it impressed itself upon meand then in a spot where i had before discerned nothing but the misty sea i beheld the green meadow separated from me by a vast expanse of blue rippling water with suntipped wavelets yet strangely near often i would peep fearfully over my right shoulder at the trees but i preferred to look at the green meadow which affected me oddlyit was while my eyes were fixed upon this singular tract that i first felt the ground in motion beneath me beginning with a kind of throbbing agitation which held a fiendish suggestion of conscious action the bit of bank on which i stood detached itself from the grassy shore and commenced to float away borne slowly onward as if by some current of resistless force i did not move astonished and startled as i was by the unprecedented phenomenon but stood rigidly still until a wide lane of water yawned betwixt me and the land of trees then i sat down in a sort of daze and again looked at the suntipped water and the green meadowbehind me the trees and the things they may have been hiding seemed to radiate infinite menace this i knew without turning to view them for as i grew more used to the scene i became less and less dependent upon the five senses that once had been my sole reliance i knew the green scaly forest hated me yet now i was safe from it for my bit of bank had drifted far from the shorebut though one peril was past another loomed up before me pieces of earth were constantly crumbling from the floating isle which held me so that death could not be far distant in any event yet even then i seemed to sense that death would be death to me no more for i turned again to watch the green meadow imbued with a curious feeling of security in strange contrast to my general horrorthen it was that i heard at a distance immeasurable the sound of falling water not that of any trivial cascade such as i had known but that which might be heard in the far scythian lands if all the mediterranean were poured down an unfathomable abyss it was toward this sound that my shrinking island was drifting yet i was contentfar in the rear were happening weird and terrible things things which i turned to view yet shivered to behold for in the sky dark vaporous forms hovered fantastically brooding over trees and seeming to answer the challenge of the waving green branches then a thick mist arose from the sea to join the skyforms and the shore was erased from my sight though the sunwhat sun i knew notshone brightly on the water around me the land i had left seemed involved in a daemoniac tempest where clashed the will of the hellish trees and what they hid with that of the sky and the sea and when the mist vanished i saw only the blue sky and the blue sea for the land and the trees were no moreit was at this point that my attention was arrested by thesingingin the green meadow hitherto as i have said i had encountered no sign of human life but now there arose to my ears a dull chant whose origin and nature were apparently unmistakable while the words were utterly undistinguishable the chant awaked in me a peculiar train of associations and i was reminded of some vaguely disquieting lines i had once translated out of an egyptian book which in turn were taken from a papyrus of ancient mero through my brain ran lines that i fear to repeat lines telling of very antique things and forms of life in the days when our earth was exceeding young of things which thought and moved and were alive yet which gods and men would not consider alive it was a strange bookas i listened i became gradually conscious of a circumstance which had before puzzled me only subconsciously at no time had my sight distinguished any definite objects in the green meadow an impression of vivid homogeneous verdure being the sum total of my perception now however i saw that the current would cause my island to pass the shore at but a little distance so that i might learn more of the land and of the singing thereon my curiosity to behold the singers had mounted high though it was mingled with apprehensionbits of sod continued to break away from the tiny tract which carried me but i heeded not their loss for i felt that i was not to die with the body or appearance of a body which i seemed to possess that everything about me even life and death was illusory that i had overleaped the bounds of mortality and corporeal entity becoming a free detached thing impressed me as almost certain of my location i knew nothing save that i felt i could not be on the earthplanet once so familiar to me my sensations apart from a kind of haunting terror were those of a traveller just embarked upon an unending voyage of discovery for a moment i thought of the lands and persons i had left behind and of strange ways whereby i might some day tell them of my adventurings even though i might never returni had now floated very near the green meadow so that the voices were clear and distinct but though i knew many languages i could not quite interpret the words of the chanting familiar they indeed were as i had subtly felt when at a greater distance but beyond a sensation of vague and awesome remembrance i could make nothing of them a most extraordinaryqualityin the voicesa quality which i cannot describeat once frightened and fascinated me my eyes could now discern several things amidst the omnipresent verdurerocks covered with bright green moss shrubs of considerable height and less definable shapes of great magnitude which seemed to move or vibrate amidst the shrubbery in a peculiar way the chanting whose authors i was so anxious to glimpse seemed loudest at points where these shapes were most numerous and most vigorously in motionand then as my island drifted closer and the sound of the

dedicated to robert blochi have seen the dark universe yawningwhere the black planets roll without aimwhere they roll in their horror unheededwithout knowledge or lustre or namenemesiscautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that robert blake was killed by lightning or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge it is true that the window he faced was unbroken but nature has shewn herself capable of many freakish performances the expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered as for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church on federal hillthe shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry conscious or unconscious with at least some of which blake was secretly connectedfor after all the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth dream terror and superstition and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre spectral sort his earlier stay in the citya visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as hehad ended amidst death and flame and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in milwaukee he may have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflectionamong those however who have examined and correlated all this evidence there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories they are inclined to take much of blakes diary at its face value and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox starry wisdom sect prior to 1877 the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named edwin m lillibridge in 1893 andabove allthe look of monstrous transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died it was one of these believers who moved to fanatical extremes threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box found in the old church steeplethe black windowless steeple and not the tower where blakes diary said those things originally were though widely censured both officially and unofficially this mana reputable physician with a taste for odd folkloreaverred that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon itbetween these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself the papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle leaving for others the drawing of the picture as robert blake saw itor thought he saw itor pretended to see it now studying the diary closely dispassionately and at leisure let us summarise the dark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief actoryoung blake returned to providence in the winter of 19345 taking the upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off college streeton the crest of the great eastward hill near the brown university campus and behind the marble john hay library it was a cosy and fascinating place in a little garden oasis of villagelike antiquity where huge friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient shed the square georgian house had a monitor roof classic doorway with fan carving smallpaned windows and all the other earmarks of early nineteenthcentury workmanship inside were sixpanelled doors wide floorboards a curving colonial staircase white adamperiod mantels and a rear set of rooms three steps below the general levelblakes study a large southwest chamber overlooked the front garden on one side while its west windowsbefore one of which he had his deskfaced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower towns outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them on the far horizon were the open countrysides purple slopes against these some two miles away rose the spectral hump of federal hill bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them blake had a curious sense that he was looking upon some unknown ethereal world which might or might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in personhaving sent home for most of his books blake bought some antique furniture suitable to his quarters and settled down to write and paintliving alone and attending to the simple housework himself his studio was in a north attic room where the panes of the monitor roof furnished admirable lighting during that first winter he produced five of his bestknown short storiesthe burrower beneath the stairs in the crypt shaggai in the vale of pnath and the feaster from the starsand painted seven canvases studies of nameless unhuman monsters and profoundly alien nonterrestrial landscapesat sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread westthe dark towers of memorial hall just below the georgian courthouse belfry the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section and that shimmering spirecrowned mound in the distance whose unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy from his few local acquaintances he learned that the faroff slope was a vast italian quarter though most of the houses were remnants of older yankee and irish days now and then he would train his fieldglasses on that spectral unreachable world beyond the curling smoke picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house even with optical aid federal hill seemed somehow alien half fabulous and linked to the unreal intangible marvels of blakes own tales and pictures the feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into the violet lampstarred twilight and the courthouse floodlights and the red industrial trust beacon had blazed up to make the night grotesqueof all the distant objects on federal hill a certain huge dark church most fascinated blake it stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky it seemed to rest on especially high ground for the grimy facade and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and chimneypots peculiarly grim and austere it appeared to be built of stone stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more the style so far as the glass could shew was that earliest experimental form of gothic revival which preceded the stately upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the georgian age perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815as months passed blake watched the faroff forbidding structure with an oddly mounting interest since the vast windows were never lighted he knew that it must be vacant the longer he watched the more his imagination worked till at length he began to fancy curious things he believed that a vague singular aura of desolation hovered over the place so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of birds but here they never rested at least that is what he thought and set down in his diary he pointed the place out to several friends but none of them had even been on federal hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was or had beenin the spring a deep restlessness gripped blake he had begun his longplanned novelbased on a supposed survival of the witchcult in mainebut was strangely unable to make progress with it more and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black frowning steeple shunned by the birds when the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty but blakes restlessness was merely increased it was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that fabulous slope into the smokewreathed world of dreamlate in april just before the aeonshadowed walpurgis time blake made his first trip into the unknown plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak decayed squares beyond he came finally upon the ascending avenue of centuryworn steps sagging doric porches and blearpaned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the longknown unreachable world beyond the mists there were dingy blueandwhite street signs which meant nothing to him and presently he noted the strange dark faces of the drifting crowds and the foreign signs over curious shops in brown decadeweathered buildings nowhere could he find any of the objects he had seen from afar so that once more he half fancied that the federal hill of that distant view was a dreamworld never to be trod by living human feetnow and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight but never the blackened pile that he sought when he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head though he spoke english freely as blake climbed higher the region seemed stranger and stranger with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south he crossed two or three broad avenues and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned the dark mans face had a look of fear which he tried to hide and blake saw him make a curious sign with his right handthen suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys blake knew at once what it was and plunged toward it through the squalid unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue twice he lost his way but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanesat last he saw the tower plain against the southwest and a huge stone bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley presently he stood in a windswept open square quaintly cobblestoned with a high bank wall on the farther side this was the end of his quest for upon the wide ironrailed weedgrown plateau which the wall supporteda separate lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streetsthere stood a grim titan bulk whose identity despite blakes new perspective was beyond disputethe vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude some of the high stone buttresses had fallen and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown neglected weeds and grasses the sooty gothic windows were largely unbroken though many of the stone mullions were missing blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so well in view of the known habits of small boys the world over the massive doors were intact and tightly closed around the top of the bank wall fully enclosing the grounds was a rusty iron fence whose gateat the head of a flight of steps from the squarewas visibly padlocked the path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place and in the birdless eaves and black ivyless walls blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to definethere were very few people in the square but blake saw a policeman at the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church he was a great wholesome irishman and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that building when blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the italian priests warned everybody against it vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark he himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father who recalled certain sounds and rumours from his boyhoodthere had been a bad sect there in the ould daysan outlaw sect that called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night it had taken a good priest to exorcise what had come though there did be those who said that merely the light could do it if father omalley were alive there would be many the thing he could tell but now there was nothing to do but let it alone it hurt nobody now and those that owned it were dead or far away they had run away like rats after the threatening talk in 77 when people began to mind the way folks vanished now and then in the neighbourhood some day the city would step in and take the property for lack of heirs but little good would come of anybodys touching it better it be left alone for the years to topple lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyssafter the policeman had gone blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile it excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated probably they were mere legends evoked by the evil look of the place but even so they were like a strange coming to life of one of his own storiesthe afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds but seemed unable to light up the stained sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high plateau it was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown withered growths in the raised ironfenced yard blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress there was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be resisted the fence had no opening near the steps but around on the north side were some missing bars he could go up the steps and walk around on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap if the people feared the place so wildly he would encounter no interferencehe was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him then looking down he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made several windows were slammed down and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety unpainted house the gap in the fence was very easy to pass through and before long blake found himself wading amidst the rotting tangled growths of the deserted yard here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in this field but that he saw must have been very long ago the sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the facade all were securely locked so he began a circuit of the cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on automaticallya yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture peering in blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western suns filtered rays debris old barrels and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines the rusted remains of a hotair furnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as midvictorian timesacting almost without conscious initiative blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dustcarpeted and debrisstrown concrete floor the vaulted cellar was a vast one without partitions and in a corner far to the right amid dense shadows he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs he felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted aboutfinding a stillintact barrel amid the dust and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit then bracing himself he crossed the wide cobwebfestooned space toward the arch half choked with the omnipresent dust and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness he had no light but groped carefully with his hands after a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead and a little fumbling revealed its ancient latch it opened inward and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with wormeaten panellingonce on the ground floor blake began exploring in a rapid fashion all the inner doors were unlocked so that he freely passed from room to room the colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews altar hourglass pulpit and soundingboard and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered gothic columns over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange halfblackened panes of the great apsidal windowsthe paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that blake could scarcely decipher what they had represented but from the little he could make out he did not like them the designs were largely conventional and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancient patterns the few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism while one of the windows seemed to shew merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity scattered about in it turning away from the windows blake noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy egyptin a rear vestry room beside the apse blake found a rotting desk and ceilinghigh shelves of mildewed disintegrating books here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror for the titles of those books told him much they were the black forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of or have heard of only in furtive timorous whispers the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of mans youth and the dim fabulous days before man was he had himself read many of thema latin version of the abhorrednecronomiconthe sinisterliber ivonisthe infamouscultes des goulesof comte derlette theunaussprechlichen kultenof von

unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult student clearly the lingering local rumours had not lied this place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universein the ruined desk was a small leatherbound recordbook filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium the manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy astrology and other dubious artsthe devices of the sun moon planets aspects and zodiacal signshere massed in solid pages of text with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letterin the hope of later solving the cryptogram blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time he wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long was he the first to conquer the clutching pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitorshaving now thoroughly explored the ground floor blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steepleobjects so long familiar to him at a distance the ascent was a choking experience for dust lay thick while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place the staircase was a spiral with high narrow wooden treads and now and then blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city though he had seen no ropes below he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow louverboarded lancet windows his fieldglass had studied so often here he was doomed to disappointment for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes and clearly devoted to vastly different purposesthe room about fifteen feet square was faintly lighted by four lancet windows one on each side which were glazed within their screening of decayed louverboards these had been further fitted with tight opaque screens but the latter were now largely rotted away in the centre of the dustladen floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar some four feet in height and two in average diameter covered on each side with bizarre crudely incised and wholly unrecognisable hieroglyphs on this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form its hinged lid thrown back and its interior holding what looked beneath the decadedeep dust to be an eggshaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through around the pillar in a rough circle were seven highbacked gothic chairs still largely intact while behind them ranging along the darkpanelled walls were seven colossal images of crumbling blackpainted plaster resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious easter island in one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall leading up to the closed trapdoor of the windowless steeple aboveas blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd basreliefs on the strange open box of yellowish metal approaching he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind depicting entities which though seemingly alive resembled no known lifeform ever evolved on this planet the fourinch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black redstriated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter it did not touch the bottom of the box but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre with seven queerly designed supports extending horizontally to angles of the boxs inner wall near the top this stone once exposed exerted upon blake an almost alarming fascination he could scarcely tear his eyes from it and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent with halfformed worlds of wonder within into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs with great stone towers and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and willwhen he did look away it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple just why it took his attention he could not tell but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind ploughing toward it and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went he began to discern something grim about it hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth and blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions it was a human skeleton and it must have been there for a very long time the clothing was in shreds but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a mans grey suit there were other bits of evidenceshoes metal clasps huge buttons for round cuffs a stickpin of bygone pattern a reporters badge with the name of the oldprovidence telegramand a crumbling leather pocketbook blake examined the latter with care finding within it several bills of antiquated issue a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893 some cards with the name edwin m lillibridge and a paper covered with pencilled memorandathis paper held much of a puzzling nature and blake read it carefully at the dim westward window its disjointed text included such phrases as the followingprof enoch bowen home from egypt may 1844buys old freewill church in julyhis archaeological work studies in occult well knowndr drowne of 4th baptist warns

blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust the implications of the notes were clear and there could be no doubt but that this man had come to the deserted edifice fortytwo years before in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt perhaps no one else had known of his planwho could tell but he had never returned to his paper had some bravely suppressed fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden heartfailure blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state some of them were badly scattered and a few seemed oddlydissolvedat the ends others were strangely yellowed with vague suggestions of charring this charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing the skull was in a very peculiar statestained yellow and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone what had happened to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here blake could not imaginebefore he realised it he was looking at the stone again and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind he saw processions of robed hooded figures whose outlines were not human and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved skyreaching monoliths he saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea and vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze and beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness where solid and semisolid forms were known only by their windy stirrings and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we knowthen all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing indeterminate panic fear blake choked and turned away from the stone conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness he felt entangled with somethingsomething which was not in the stone but which had looked through it at himsomething which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight plainly the place was getting on his nervesas well it might in view of his gruesome find the light was waning too and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soonit was then in the gathering twilight that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone he had tried to look away from it but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes back was there a subtle phosphorescence of radioactivity about the thing what was it that the dead mans notes had said concerning ashining trapezohedronwhat anyway was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil what had been done here and what might still be lurking in the birdshunned shadows it seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by though its source was not apparent blake seized the cover of the longopen box and snapped it down it moved easily on its alien hinges and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stoneat the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeples eternal blackness overhead beyond the trapdoor rats without questionthe only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it and yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs across the ghoulish nave into the vaulted basement out amidst the gathering dusk of the deserted square and down through the teeming fearhaunted alleys and avenues of federal hill toward the sane central streets and the homelike brick sidewalks of the college districtduring the days which followed blake told no one of his expedition instead he read much in certain books examined long years of newspaper files downtown and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room the cipher he soon saw was no simple one and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be english latin greek french spanish italian or german evidently he would have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange eruditionevery evening the old impulse to gaze westward returned and he saw the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and halffabulous world but now it held a fresh note of terror for him he knew the heritage of evil lore it masked and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways the birds of spring were returning and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt lone spire as never before when a flock of them approached it he thought they would wheel and scatter in panic confusionand he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening milesit was in june that blakes diary told of his victory over the cryptogram the text was he found in the dark aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity and known to him in a halting way through previous researches the diary is strangely reticent about what blake deciphered but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results there are references to a haunter of the dark awaked by gazing into the shining trapezohedron and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called the being is spoken of as holding all knowledge and demanding monstrous sacrifices some of blakes entries shew fear lest the thing which he seemed to regard as summoned stalk abroad though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossedof the shining trapezohedron he speaks often calling it a window on all time and space and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark yuggoth before ever the old ones brought it to earth it was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of antarctica salvaged from their ruins by the serpentmen of valusia and peered at aeons later in lemuria by the first human beings it crossed strange lands and stranger seas and sank with atlantis before a minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted khem the pharaoh nephrenka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new pharaoh destroyed till the delvers spade once more brought it forth to curse mankindearly in july the newspapers oddly supplement blakes entries though in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution it appears that a new fear had been growing on federal hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church the italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams something they said was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth press items mentioned the longstanding local superstitions but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror it was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians in writing of these things in his diary blake expresses a curious kind of remorse and talks of the duty of burying the shining trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire at the same time however he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination and admits a morbid longingpervading even his dreamsto visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stonethen something in thejournalon the morning of july 17 threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror it was only a variant of the other halfhumorous items about the federal hill restlessness but to blake it was somehow very terrible indeed in the night a thunderstorm had put the citys lightingsystem out of commission for a full hour and in that black interval the italians had nearly gone mad with fright those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the streetlamps absence and gone down into the body of the church flopping and bumping around in a viscous altogether dreadful way toward the last it had bumped up to the tower where there were sounds of the shattering of glass it could go wherever the darkness reached but light would always send it fleeingwhen the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower for even the feeble light trickling through the grimeblackened louverboarded windows was too much for the thing it had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in timefor a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it during the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellasa guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness once those nearest the church declared the outer door had rattled hideouslybut even this was not the worst that evening in thebulletinblake read of what the reporters had found aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain they found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way with bits of rotted cushions and satin pewlinings scattered curiously around there was a bad odour everywhere and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches of what looked like charring opening the door to the tower and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly cleanin the tower itself a similarly halfswept condition existed they spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar the overturned gothic chairs and the bizarre plaster images though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned what disturbed blake the mostexcept for the hints of stains and charring and bad odourswas the final detail that explained the crashing glass every one of the towers lancet windows was broken and two of them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin pewlinings and cushionhorsehair into the spaces between the slanting exterior louverboards more satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor as if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained daysyellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless spire but when a reporter climbed up opened the horizontally sliding trapdoor and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space he saw nothing but darkness and an heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture the verdict of course was charlatanry somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hilldwellers or else some fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good or perhaps some of the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside world there was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports three men in succession found ways of evading the assignment and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reportersfrom this point onward blakes diary shews a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension he upbraids himself for not doing something and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown it has been verified that on three occasionsduring thunderstormshe telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken now and then his entries shew concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone and the strangely marred old skeleton when they explored the shadowy tower room he assumed that these things had been removedwhither and by whom or what he could only guess but his worst fears concerned himself and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeplethat monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces he seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of the west window at that faroff spirebristling mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city his entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep there is mention of a night when he awaked to find himself fully dressed outdoors and headed automatically down college hill toward the west again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find himthe week following july 30 is recalled as the time of blakes partial breakdown he did not dress and ordered all his food by telephone visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed and he said that sleepwalking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untyingin his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse after retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space all he could see were short faint horizontal streaks of bluish light but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft furtive sounds above him whenever he moved he stumbled over something and at each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from abovea vague stirring mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on woodonce his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall and fumbling his uncertain way upward toward some region of intenser stench where a hot searing blast beat down against him before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness he thought of the ancient legends of ultimate chaos at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god azathoth lord of all things encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a daemoniac flute held in nameless pawsthen a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the unutterable horror of his position what it was he never knewperhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on federal hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints or the saints of their native villages in italy in any event he shrieked aloud dropped frantically from the ladder and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed himhe knew instantly where he was and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase tripping and bruising himself at every turn there was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow a sightless scramble through a littered basement a climb to regions of air and streetlights outside and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables across a grim silent city of tall black towers and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient dooron regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed dirt and cobwebs covered him and every inch of his body seemed sore and bruised when he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing it was then that his nerves broke down thereafter lounging exhaustedly about in a dressinggown he did little but stare from his west window shiver at the threat of thunder and make wild entries in his diarythe great storm broke just before midnight on august 8th lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city and two remarkable fireballs were reported the rain was torrential while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system and tried to telephone the company around 1 am though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety he recorded everything in his diarythe large nervous and often undecipherable hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair and of entries scrawled blindly in the darkhe had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window and it appears that most of his time was spent at his desk peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking federal hill now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary so that detached phrases such as the lights must not go it knows where i am i must destroy it and it is calling to me but perhaps it means no injury this time are found scattered down two of the pagesthen the lights went out all over the city it happened at 212 am according to powerhouse records but blakes diary gives no indication of the time the entry is merely lights outgod help me on federal hill there were watchers as anxious as he and rainsoaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrellashaded candles electric flashlights oil lanterns crucifixes and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern italy they blessed each flash of lightning and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether a rising wind blew out most of the candles so that the scene grew threateningly dark someone roused father merluzzo of spirito santo church and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower there could be no doubt whateverfor what happened at 235 we have the testimony of the priest a young intelligent and welleducated person of patrolman william j monahan of the central station an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd and of most of the seventyeight men who had gathered around the churchs high bank wallespecially those in the square where the eastward facade was visible of course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of nature the possible causes of such an event are many no one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast ancient illaired and longdeserted building of heterogeneous contents mephitic vapoursspontaneous combustionpressure of gases born of long decayany one of numberless phenomena might be responsible and then of course the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded the thing was really quite simple in itself and covered less than three minutes of actual time father merluzzo always a precise man looked at his watch repeatedlyit started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower there had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange evil odours from the church and this had now become emphatic and offensive then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a large heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade the tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the smokegrimed louverboarding of that towers east windowimmediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights choking and sickening the trembling watchers and almost prostrating those in the square at the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings and a sudden eastblowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas of the crowd nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night though some upwardlooking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky skysomething like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed toward the eastthat was all the watchers were half numbed with fright awe and discomfort and scarcely knew what to do or whether to do anything at all not knowing what had happened they did not relax their vigil and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning followed by an earsplitting crash of sound rent the flooded heavens half an hour later the rain stopped and in fifteen minutes more the streetlights sprang on again sending the weary bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homesthe next days papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with the general storm reports it seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the federal hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed the phenomenon was most marked over college hill where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens it was agreed that the lone sudden lightningbolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood though no trace of its striking could afterward be found a youth in the tau omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst but his observation has not been verified all of the few observers however agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally generalthese points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connexion with the death of robert blake students in the psi delta house whose upper rear windows looked into blakes study noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the 9th and wondered what was wrong with the expression when they saw the same face in the same position that evening they felt worried and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment later they rang the bell of the darkened flat and finally had a policeman force the doorthe rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window and when the intruders saw the glassy bulging eyes and the marks of stark convulsive fright on the twisted features they turned away in sickened dismay shortly afterward the coroners physician made an examination and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge as the cause of death the hideous expression he ignored altogether deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions he deduced these latter qualities from the books paintings and manuscripts found in the apartment and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last and the brokenpointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right handthe entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed and legible only in part from them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative the case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious dr dexter who threw the curious box and angled stonean object certainly selfluminous as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was foundinto the deepest channel of narragansett bay excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on blakes part aggravated by

i saw him on a sleepless night when i was walking desperately to save my soul and my vision my coming to new york had been a mistake for whereas i had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten and in the cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly babylonian under waning moons i had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master paralyse and annihilate methe disillusion had been gradual coming for the first time upon the town i had seen it in the sunset from a bridge majestic above its waters its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming golden clouds and the first stars of evening then it had lighted up window by window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies and itself become a starry firmament of dream redolent of faery music and one with the marvels of carcassonne and samarcand and el dorado and all glorious and halffabulous cities shortly afterward i was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancynarrow curving alleys and passages where rows of red georgian brick blinked with smallpaned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coachesand in the first flush of realisation of these longwished things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poetbut success and happiness were not to be garish daylight shewed only squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic and the throngs of people that seethed through the flumelike streets were squat swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes about them who could never mean aught to a blueeyed man of the old folk with the love of fair green lanes and white new england village steeples in his heartso instead of the poems i had hoped for there came only a shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness and i saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe beforethe unwhisperable secret of secretsthe fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of old new york as london is of old london and paris of old paris but that it is in fact quite dead its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life upon making this discovery i ceased to sleep comfortably though something of resigned tranquillity came back as i gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraithlike about and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them with this mode of relief i even wrote a few poems and still refrained from going home to my people lest i seem to crawl back ignobly in defeatthen on a sleepless nights walk i met the man it was in a grotesque hidden courtyard of the greenwich section for there in my ignorance i had settled having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists the archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted me and when i found the poets and artists to be loudvoiced pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art i stayed on for love of these venerable things i fancied them as they were in their prime when greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town and in the hours before dawn when all the revellers had slunk away i used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited there this kept my soul alive and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for which the poet far within me cried outthe man came upon me at about two one cloudy august morning as i was threading a series of detached courtyards now accessible only through the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings but once forming parts of a continuous network of picturesque alleys i had heard of them by vague rumour and realised that they could not be upon any map of today but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me so that i had sought them with twice my usual eagerness now that i had found them my eagerness was again redoubled for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such with dark dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements or lurking lamplessly behind archways unbetrayed by hordes of the foreignspeaking or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practices do not invite publicity or the light of dayhe spoke to me without invitation noting my mood and glances as i studied certain knockered doorways above ironrailed steps the pallid glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face his own face was in shadow and he wore a widebrimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the outofdate cloak he affected but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me his form was very slight thin almost to cadaverousness and his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow though not particularly deep he had he said noticed me several times at my wanderings and inferred that i resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years would i not like the guidance of one long practiced in these explorations and possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly have gainedas he spoke i caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window it was a noble even a handsome elderly countenance and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for the age and place yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased meperhaps it was too white or too expressionless or too much out of keeping with the locality to make me feel easy or comfortable nevertheless i followed him for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive and i reckoned it a rare favour of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than minesomething in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick walls and once crawled on hands and knees through a low arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location i had managed to preserve the things we saw were very old and marvellous or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urnheaded iron fenceposts and flaringlintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquitywe met no person and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer the streetlights we first encountered had been of oil and of the ancient lozenge pattern later i noticed some with candles and at last after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooden gate in a high wall we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh houseunbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides this alley led steeply uphillmore steeply than i thought possible in this part of new yorkand the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivyclad wall of a private estate beyond which i could see a pale cupola and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky in this wall was a small lowarched gate of nailstudded black oak which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key leading me within he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house which he unlocked and opened for mewe entered and as we did so i grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay my host appeared not to notice this and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway across a hall and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us then i saw him pull the curtains of the three smallpaned windows that barely shewed themselves against the lightening sky after which he crossed to the mantel struck flint and steel lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces and made a gesture enjoining softtoned speechin this feeble radiance i saw that we were in a spacious wellfurnished and panelled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century with splendid doorway pediments a delightful doric cornice and a magnificently carved overmantel with scrollandurn top above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were wellwrought family portraits all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful chippendale table before seating himself across the table from me my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment then tardily removing his gloves widebrimmed hat and cloak stood theatrically revealed in full midgeorgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to kneebreeches silk hose and the buckled shoes i had not previously noticed now slowly sinking into a lyreback chair he commenced to eye me intentlywithout his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before and i wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my original disquiet when he spoke at length his soft hollow and carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered and now and then i had great difficulty in following him as i listened with a thrill of amazement and halfdisavowed alarm which grew each instantyou behold sir my host began a man of very eccentrical habits for whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations reflecting upon better times i have not scrupled to ascertain their ways and adopt their dress and manners an indulgence which offends none if practiced without ostentation it hath been my goodfortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors swallowed though it was by two towns first greenwich which built up hither after 1800 then newyork which joined on near 1830 there were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family and i have not been remiss in discharging such obligations the squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding some curious effects of these arts and discoveries i now purpose to shew you under the strictest secrecy and i believe i may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelityhe paused but i could only nod my head i have said that i was alarmed yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of new york and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts i had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer so i listenedtomy ancestor he softly continued there appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind qualities having a littlesuspected dominance not only over the acts of ones self and of others but over every variety of force and substance in nature and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than nature herself may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain halfbreed red indians once encamped upon this hill these indians shewed choler when the place was built and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon for years they stole over the wall each month when they could and by stealth performed sartain acts then in 68 the new squire catched them at their doings and stood still at what he saw thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old dutchman in the time of the statesgeneral and pox on him im afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rumwhether or not by intentfor a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it you sir are the first outsider to be told there is a secret and split me if id have risked tampering that much withthe powershad ye not been so hot after bygone thingsi shuddered as the man grew colloquialand with familiar speech of another day he went onbut you must know sir that whatthe squiregot from those mongrel salvages was but a small part of the larning he came to have he had not been at oxford for nothing nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in paris he was in fine made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects past the bidding of the vulgar but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco what we want we may make about us and what we dont want we may sweep away i wont say that all this is wholly true in body but tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then you i conceive would be tickled by a better sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you so be pleased to hold back any fright at what i design to shew come to the window and be quietmy host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold his flesh though dry and firm was of the quality of ice and i almost shrank away from his pulling but again i thought of the emptiness and horror of reality and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever i might be led once at the window the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into the blackness outside for a moment i saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights far far before me then as if in response to an insidious motion of my hosts hand a flash of heatlightning played over the scene and i looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliagefoliage unpolluted and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind on my right the hudson glittered wickedly and in the distance ahead i saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies the flash died and an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancerthat was before my timebefore the new squires time pray let us try againi was faint even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had made megood god i whispered can you do that forany timeand as he nodded and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs i clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling but he steadied me with that terrible icecold claw and once more made his insidious gestureagain the lightning flashedbut this time upon a scene not wholly strange it was greenwich the greenwich that used to be with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it now yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy common the marsh still glittered beyond but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york trinity and st pauls and the brick church dominating their sisters and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole i breathed hard but not so much from the sight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured upcan youdare yougofari spoke with awe and i think he shared it for a second but the evil grin returnedfarwhat i have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone back backforwardforwardlook ye puling lackwitand as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before for full three seconds i could glimpse that pandaemoniac sight and in those seconds i saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams i saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon and devillights burning from unnumbered windows and swarming loathsomely on arial galleries i saw the yellow squinteyed people of that city robed horribly in orange and red and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettledrums the clatter of obscene crotala and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed ocean of bitumeni saw this vista i say and heard as with the minds ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpsecity had ever stirred in my soul and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about methen as the flash subsided i saw that my host was trembling too a look of shocking fear half blotting from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited he tottered clutched at the curtains as i had done before and wriggled his head wildly like a hunted animal god knows he had cause for as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious it was the steady stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door as with the ascent of a barefoot or skinshod horde and at last the cautious purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight the old man clawed and spat at me through the mouldy air and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutchedthe full moondamn yeye ye yelping dogye called em and theyve come for me moccasined feetdead mengad sink ye ye red devils but i poisoned no rum o yourshant i kept your poxrotted magic safeye swilled yourselves sick curse ye and ye must needs blame the squirelet go you unhand that latchive naught for ye hereat this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician his fright turning to steely despair left room for a resurgence of his rage against me and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge i was steadying myself the curtains still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged in those greenish beams the candles paled and a new semblance of decay spread over the muskreeking room with its wormy panelling sagging floor battered mantel rickety furniture and ragged draperies it spread over the old man too whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence and i saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons only his eyes stayed whole and they glared with a propulsive dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindledthe rapping was now repeated with greater insistence and this time bore a hint of metal the black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels and i saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood i did not move for i could not but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining malevolent eyes it poured thickly like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead overturned a chair as it spread and finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me around that head it closed totally swallowing it up and in another moment it had begun to recede bearing away its invisible burden without touching me and flowing again out of that black doorway and down the unseen stairs which creaked as before though in reverse orderthen the floor gave way at last and i slid gaspingly down into the nighted chamber below choking with cobwebs and half swooning with terror the green moon shining through broken windows shewed me the hall door half open and as i rose from the plasterstrown floor and twisted myself free from the sagged ceilings i saw sweep past it an awful torrent of blackness with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it it was seeking the door to the cellar and when it found it it vanished therein i now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done and once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window of something which must have been the cupola now liberated for the instant from the wreckage i rushed through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open it seized a chair and broke a window climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moonlight danced over yardhigh grass and weeds the wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of boxes in a corner i managed to gain the top and cling to the great stone urn set thereabout me in my exhaustion i could see only strange walls and windows and old gambrel roofs the steep street of my approach was nowhere visible and the little i did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight suddenly the urn to which i clung began to tremble as if sharing my own lethal dizziness and in another instant my body was plunging downward to i knew not what fatethe man who found me said that i must have crawled a long way despite my broken bones for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look the gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal and reports could state no more than that i had appeared from a place unknown at the entrance of a little black court off perry streeti never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths nor would i direct any sane man thither if i could of who or what that ancient creature was i have no idea but i repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors whitherhehas gone i do not know but i have gone home to the pure new england lanes up which fragrant seawinds sweep at evening,1
i from the darkof herbert west who was my friend in college and in after life i can speak only with extreme terror this terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance but was engendered by the whole nature of his lifework and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago when we were in the third year of our course at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham while he was with me the wonder and diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly and i was his closest companion now that he is gone and the spell is broken the actual fear is greater memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realitiesthe first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock i ever experienced and it is only with reluctance that i repeat it as i have said it happened when we were in the medical school where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially his views which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and his fellowstudents hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes in his experiments with various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits guineapigs cats dogs and monkeys till he had become the prime nuisance of the college several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead in many cases violent signs but he soon saw that the perfection of this process if indeed possible would necessarily involve a lifetime of research it likewise became clear that since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress it was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himselfthe learned and benevolent dr allan halsey whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of arkhami had always been exceptionally tolerant of wests pursuits and we frequently discussed his theories whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process and that the socalled soul is a myth my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues and that unless actual decomposition has set in a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive braincells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause west fully realised it had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial lifemotions were incompatible he then sought extreme freshness in his specimens injecting his solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life it was this circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case they did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoninglyit was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that west confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly to hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves whenever the morgue proved inadequate two local negroes attended to this matter and they were seldom questioned west was then a small slender spectacled youth with delicate features yellow hair pale blue eyes and a soft voice and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potters field we finally decided on the potters field because practically every body in christchurch was embalmed a thing of course ruinous to wests researchesi was by this time his active and enthralled assistant and helped him make all his decisions not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work it was i who thought of the deserted chapman farmhouse beyond meadow hill where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings the place was far from any road and in sight of no other house yet precautions were none the less necessary since rumours of strange lights started by chance nocturnal roamers would soon bring disaster on our enterprise it was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in boston or quietly borrowed from the collegematerials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyesand provided spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar at the college we used an incinerator but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory bodies were always a nuisanceeven the small guineapig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in wests room at the boardinghousewe followed the local deathnotices like ghouls for our specimens demanded particular qualities what we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation preferably free from malforming disease and certainly with all organs present accident victims were our best hope not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities ostensibly in the colleges interest as often as we could without exciting suspicion we found that the college had first choice in every case so that it might be necessary to remain in arkham during the summer when only the limited summerschool classes were held in the end though luck favoured us for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potters field a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in sumners pond and buried at the towns expense without delay or embalming that afternoon we found the new grave and determined to begin work soon after midnightit was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us we carried spades and oil dark lanterns for although electric torches were then manufactured they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today the process of unearthing was slow and sordidit might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientistsand we were glad when our spades struck wood when the pine box was fully uncovered west scrambled down and removed the lid dragging out and propping up the contents i reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance the affair made us rather nervous especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy but we managed to remove all traces of our visit when we had patted down the last shovelful of earth we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old chapman place beyond meadow hillon an improvised dissectingtable in the old farmhouse by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp the specimen was not very spectral looking it had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian typelargeframed greyeyed and brownhaireda sound animal without psychological subtleties and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort now with the eyes closed it looked more asleep than dead though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score we had at last what west had always longed fora real dead man of the ideal kind ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use the tension on our part became very great we knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration i myself still held some curious notions about the traditional soul of man and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead i wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres and what he could relate if fully restored to life but my wonder was not overwhelming since for the most part i shared the materialism of my friend he was calmer than i as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the bodys arm immediately binding the incision securelythe waiting was gruesome but west never faltered every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen and bore the negative results philosophically after about threequarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize we had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar and would have to fill it by dawnfor although we had fixed a lock on the house we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery besides the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical carethe awful event was very sudden and wholly unexpected i was pouring something from one testtube to another and west was busy over the alcohol blastlamp which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice when from the pitchblack room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned for in one inconceivable cacophony was centred all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature human it could not have beenit is not in man to make such soundsand without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery both west and i leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals overturning tubes lamp and retorts and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraintjust enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauchwe did not separate but managed to get to wests room where we whispered with the gas up until dawn by then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for investigation so that we could sleep through the dayclasses being disregarded but that evening two items in the paper wholly unrelated made it again impossible for us to sleep the old deserted chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes that we could understand because of the upset lamp also an attempt had been made to disturb a new grave in the potters field as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth that we could not understand for we had patted down the mould very carefullyand for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder and complain of fancied footsteps behind him now he has disappearedii the plaguedaemoni shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham it is by that satanic scourge that most recall the year for truly terror brooded with batwings over the piles of coffins in the tombs of christchurch cemetery yet for me there is a greater horror in that timea horror known to me alone now that herbert west has disappearedwest and i were doing postgraduate work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead after the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean dr allan halsey though west had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy boardinghouse room and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its grave in the potters field to a deserted farmhouse beyond meadow hilli was with him on that odious occasion and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which he thought would to some extent restore lifes chemical and physical processes it had ended horriblyin a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nervesand west had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted the body had not been quite fresh enough it is obvious that to restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed and a burning of the old house had prevented us from burying the thing it would have been better if we could have known it was undergroundafter that experience west had dropped his researches for some time but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned he again became importunate with the college faculty pleading for the use of the dissectingroom and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important his pleas however were wholly in vain for the decision of dr halsey was inflexible and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader in the radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful enthusiast whose slight form yellow hair spectacled blue eyes and soft voice gave no hint of the supernormalalmost diabolicalpower of the cold brain within i can see him now as he was thenand i shiver he grew sterner of face but never elderly and now sefton asylum has had the mishap and west has vanishedwest clashed disagreeably with dr halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy he felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university that the traditionbound elders should ignore his singular results on animals and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of wests logical temperament only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the professordoctor typethe product of generations of pathetic puritanism kindly conscientious and sometimes gentle and amiable yet always narrow intolerant customridden and lacking in perspective age has more charity for these incomplete yet highsouled characters whose worst real vice is timidity and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sinssins like ptolemaism calvinism antidarwinism antinietzscheism and every sort of sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation west young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements had scant patience with good dr halsey and his erudite colleagues and nursed an increasing resentment coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion like most youths he indulged in elaborate daydreams of revenge triumph and final magnanimous forgivenessand then had come the scourge grinning and lethal from the nightmare caverns of tartarus west and i had graduated about the time of its beginning but had remained for additional work at the summer school so that we were in arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town though not as yet licenced physicians we now had our degrees and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew the situation was almost past management and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle burials without embalming were made in rapid succession and even the christchurch cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead this circumstance was not without effect on west who thought often of the irony of the situationso many fresh specimens yet none for his persecuted researches we were frightfully overworked and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidlybut wests gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties college had all but closed and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague dr halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service applying his extreme skill with wholehearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion west could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissectingroom one night and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution the thing actually opened its eyes but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soulpetrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it west said it was not fresh enoughthe hot summer air does not favour corpses that time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing and west doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratorythe peak of the epidemic was reached in august west and i were almost dead and dr halsey did die on the 14th the students all attended the hasty funeral on the 15th and bought an impressive wreath though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy arkham citizens and by the municipality itself it was almost a public affair for the dean had surely been a public benefactor after the entombment we were all somewhat depressed and spent the afternoon at the bar of the commercial house where west though shaken by the death of his chief opponent chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories most of the students went home or to various duties as the evening advanced but west persuaded me to aid him in making a night of it wests landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning with a third man between us and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather wellapparently this acidulous matron was right for about 3 am the whole house was aroused by cries coming from wests room where when they broke down the door they found the two of us unconscious on the bloodstained carpet beaten scratched and mauled and with the broken remnants of wests bottles and instruments around us only an open window told what had become of our assailant and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made there were some strange garments in the room but west upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases he ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace to the police we both declared ignorance of our late companions identity he was west nervously said a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location we had all been rather jovial and west and i did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted downthat same night saw the beginning of the second arkham horrorthe horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed the victim had been seen alive considerably after midnightthe dawn revealed the unutterable thing the manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of bolton was questioned but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate a fainter trail led away toward the woods but it soon gave outthe next night devils danced on the roofs of arkham and unnatural madness howled in the wind through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague and which some whispered was the embodied daemonsoul of the plague itself eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wakein all seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless sadistic monster that crept abroad a few persons had half seen it in the dark and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked for sometimes it had been hungry the number it had killed was fourteen three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been aliveon the third night frantic bands of searchers led by the police captured it in a house on crane street near the miskatonic campus they had organised the quest with care keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window the net was quickly spread on account of the general alarm and precautions there were only two more victims and the capture was effected without major casualties the thing was finally stopped by a bullet though not a fatal one and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathingfor it had been a man this much was clear despite the nauseous eyes the voiceless simianism and the daemoniac savagery they dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at sefton where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen yearsuntil the recent mishap when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention what had most disgusted the searchers of arkham was the thing they noticed when the monsters face was cleanedthe mocking unbelievable resemblance to a learned and selfsacrificing martyr who had been entombed but three days beforethe late dr allan halsey public benefactor and dean of the medical school of miskatonic universityto the vanished herbert west and to me the disgust and horror were supreme i shudder tonight as i think of it shudder even more than i did that morning when west muttered through his bandagesdamn it it wasntquitefresh enoughiii six shots by midnightit is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient but many things in the life of herbert west were uncommon it is for instance not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office yet that was the case with herbert west when he and i obtained our degrees at the medical school of miskatonic university and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated and as near as possible to the potters fieldreticence such as this is seldom without a cause nor indeed was ours for our requirements were those resulting from a lifework distinctly unpopular outwardly we were doctors only but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible momentfor the essence of herbert wests existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyards cold clay such a quest demands strange materials among them fresh human bodies and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal intermentwest and i had met in college and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant and now that we were out of college we had to keep together it was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in boltona factory town near arkham the seat of the college the bolton worsted mills are the largest in the miskatonic valley and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians we chose our house with the greatest care seizing at last on a rather rundown cottage near the end of pond street five numbers from the closest neighbour and separated from the local potters field by only a stretch of meadow land bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north the distance was greater than we wished but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field wholly out of the factory district we were not much displeased however since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies the walk was a trifle long but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbedour practice was surprisingly large from the very firstlarge enough to please most young doctors and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere the millhands were of somewhat turbulent inclinations and besides their many natural needs their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do but what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellarthe laboratory with the long table under the electric lights where in the small hours of the morning we often injected wests various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potters field west was experimenting madly to find something which would start mans vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles the solution had to be differently compounded for different typeswhat would serve for guineapigs would not serve for human beings and different human specimens required large modificationsthe bodies had to be exceedingly fresh or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible indeed the greatest problem was to get them fresh enoughwest had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage the results of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total failures and we both held fearsome recollections of such things ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on meadow hill in arkham we had felt a brooding menace and west though a calm blond blueeyed scientific automaton in most respects often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit he half felt that he was followeda psychological delusion of shaken nerves enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alivea frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at sefton then there was anotherour firstwhose exact fate we had never learnedwe had fair luck with specimens in boltonmuch better than in arkham we had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed it had lost an armif it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better between then and the next january we secured three more one total failure one case of marked muscular motion and one rather shivery thingit rose of itself and uttered a sound then came a period when luck was poor interments fell off and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use we kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic careone march night however we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potters field in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxingwith the usual result surreptitious and illconducted bouts among the millworkers were common and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported this late winter night there had been such a match evidently with disastrous results since two timorous poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case we followed them to an abandoned barn where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floorthe match had been between kid obriena lubberly and now quaking youth with a most unhibernian hooked noseand buck robinson the harlem smoke the negro had been knocked out and a moments examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so he was a loathsome gorillalike thing with abnormally long arms which i could not help calling fore legs and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable congo secrets and tomtom poundings under an eerie moon the body must have looked even worse in lifebut the world holds many ugly things fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up and they were grateful when west in spite of my involuntary shudders offered to get rid of the thing quietlyfor a purpose i knew too wellthere was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham we approached the house from the field in the rear took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs and prepared it for the usual experiment our fear of the police was absurdly great though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that sectionthe result was wearily anticlimactic ghastly as our prize appeared it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only so as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn we did as we had done with the othersdragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potters field and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish the grave was not very deep but fully as good as that of the previous specimenthe thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound in the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and densethe next day i was increasingly apprehensive about the police for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death west had still another source of worry for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly an italian woman had become hysterical over her missing childa lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinnerand had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart it was a very foolish hysteria for the boy had often run away before but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts about seven oclock in the evening she had died and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill west whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life friends had held him when he drew a stiletto but west departed amidst his inhuman shrieks curses and oaths of vengeance in his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have forgotten his child who was still missing as the night advanced there was some talk of searching the woods but most of the familys friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man altogether the nervous strain upon west must have been tremendous thoughts of the police and of the mad italian both weighed heavilywe retired about eleven but i did not sleep well bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town and i could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down it might mean the end of all our local workand perhaps prison for both west and me i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about after the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes but i turned over without rising to pull down the shade then came the steady rattling at the back doori lay still and somewhat dazed but before long heard wests rap on my door he was clad in dressinggown and slippers and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight from the revolver i knew that he was thinking more of the crazed italian than of the policewed better both go he whispered it wouldnt do not to answer it anyway and it may be a patientit would be like one of those fools to try the back doorso we both went down the stairs on tiptoe with a fear partly justified and partly that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours the rattling continued growing somewhat louder when we reached the door i cautiously unbolted it and threw it open and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there west did a peculiar thing despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigationa thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottagemy friend suddenly excitedly and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitorfor that visitor was neither italian nor policeman looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmaresa glassyeyed inkblack apparition nearly on all fours covered with bits of mould leaves and vines foul with caked blood and having between its glistening teeth a snowwhite terrible cylindrical object terminating in a tiny handiv the scream of the deadthe scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of dr herbert west which harassed the latter years of our companionship it is natural that such a thing as a dead mans scream should give horror for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence but i was used to similar experiences hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance and as i have implied it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraidherbert west whose associate and assistant i was possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician that was why when establishing his practice in bolton he had chosen an isolated house near the potters field briefly and brutally stated wests sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution for this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms scores of rabbits and guineapigs had been killed and treated but their trail was a blind one west had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh what he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life there was hope that this second and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection but we had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action to establish the artificial motion natural life must be extinctthe specimens must be very fresh but genuinely deadthe awesome quest had begun when west and i were students at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical nature of life that was seven years before but west looked scarcely a day older nowhe was small blond cleanshaven softvoiced and spectacled with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his terrible investigations our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme the results of defective reanimation when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid unnatural and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solutionone thing had uttered a nerveshattering scream another had risen violently beaten us both to unconsciousness and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind asylum bars still another a loathsome african monstrosity had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deedwest had had to shoot that object we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated so had perforce created nameless horrors it was disturbing to think that one perhaps two of our monsters still livedthat thought haunted us shadowingly till finally west disappeared under frightful circumstances but at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated bolton cottage our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens west was more avid than i so that it almost seemed to me that he looked halfcovetously at any very healthy living physiqueit was in july 1910 that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation he had he told me excitedly in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new anglethat of artificial preservation i had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound and was not surprised that it had turned out well but until he explained the details i was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them this i now saw west had clearly recognised creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the bolton prizefight at last fate had been kind so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun what would happen on reanimation and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason west did not venture to predict the experiment would be a landmark in our studies and he had saved the new body for my return so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashionwest told me how he had obtained the specimen it had been a vigorous man a welldressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the bolton worsted mills the walk through the town had been long and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories his heart had become greatly overtaxed he had refused a stimulant and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later the body as might be expected seemed to west a heavensent gift in his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in bolton and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one robert leavitt of st louis apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance if this man could not be restored to life no one would know of our experiment we buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the potters field if on the other hand he could be restored our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established so without delay west had injected into the bodys wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival the matter of the presumably weak heart which to my mind imperiled the success of our experiment did not appear to trouble west extensively he hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained beforea rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal living creatureso on the night of july 18 1910 herbert west and i stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white silent figure beneath the dazzling arclight the embalming compound had worked uncannily well for as i stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening i was moved to seek wests assurance that the thing was really dead this assurance he gave readily enough reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests as to life since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present as west proceeded to take preliminary steps i was impressed by the vast intricacy of the new experiment an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate than his own forbidding me to touch the body he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound this he said was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected slightly later when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs west stuffed a pillowlike object violently over the twitching face not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation the pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness withdrew satisfied and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days when our feats were new and groping i cannot express the wild breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimenthe first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abysswest was a materialist believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond deaths barrier i did not wholly disagree with him theoretically yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers so that i could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation besidesi could not extract from my memory that hideous inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at arkhamvery little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure a touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalkwhite and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard west who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist suddenly nodded significantly and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the bodys mouth there followed a few spasmodic muscular motions and then an audible breathing and visible motion of the chest i looked at the closed eyelids and thought i detected a quivering then the lids opened shewing eyes which were grey calm and alive but still unintelligent and not even curiousin a moment of fantastic whim i whispered questions to the reddening ears questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present subsequent terror drove them from my mind but i think the last one which i repeated was where have you been i do not yet know whether i was answered or not for no sound came from the wellshaped mouth but i do know that at that moment i firmly thought the thin lips moved silently forming syllables i would have vocalised as only now if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy at that moment as i say i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason in the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph no doubt that the solution had truly accomplished at least temporarily its full mission of restoring rational and articulate life to the dead but in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrorsnot horror of the thing that spoke but of the deed that i had witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joinedfor that very fresh body at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brainhelp keep off you cursed little towhead fiendkeep that damned needle away from mev the horror from the shadowsmany men have related hideous things not mentioned in print which happened on the battlefields of the great war some of these things have made me faint others have convulsed me with devastating nausea while still others have made me tremble and look behind me in the dark yet despite the worst of them i believe i can myself relate the most hideous thing of allthe shocking the unnatural the unbelievable horror from the shadowsin 1915 i was a physician with the rank of first lieutenant in a canadian regiment in flanders one of many americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle i had not entered the army on my own initiative but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant i wasthe celebrated boston surgical specialist dr herbert west dr west had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war and when the chance had come he carried me with him almost against my will there were reasons why i would have been glad to let the war separate us reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleagues influence secured a medical commission as major i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacitywhen i say that dr west was avid to serve in battle i do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation always an icecold intellectual machine slight blond blueeyed and spectacled i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality there was however something he wanted in embattled flanders and in order to secure it he had to assume a military exterior what he wanted was not a thing which many persons want but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results it was in fact nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismembermentherbert west needed fresh bodies because his lifework was the reanimation of the dead this work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in boston but was only too well known to me who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in miskatonic university medical school at arkham it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained there was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways he had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh a certain number of these failures had remained aliveone was in an asylum while others had vanishedand as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stoliditywest had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in bodysnatching in college and during our early practice together in the factory town of bolton my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration but as his boldness in methods grew i began to develop a gnawing fear i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it that was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse and his success obtained at such a loathsome cost had completely hardened himof his methods in the intervening five years i dare not speak i was held to him by sheer force of fear and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat gradually i came to find herbert west himself more horrible than anything he didthat was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness his interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust he became behind his pallid intellectuality a fastidious baudelaire of physical experimenta languid elagabalus of the tombsdangers he met unflinchingly crimes he committed unmoved i think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies he had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nervetissue separated from natural physiological systems and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of neverdying artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settlefirst whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain proceeding from the spinal cord and various nervecentres and second whether any kind of ethereal intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism all this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human fleshand that was why herbert west had entered the great warthe phantasmal unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march 1915 in a field hospital behind the lines at st eloi i wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium west had a private laboratory in an east room of the barnlike temporary edifice assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory waresi could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned among these sounds were frequent revolvershotssurely not uncommon on a battlefield but distinctly uncommon in an hospital dr wests reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience besides human tissue west employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results it was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments and that was now my friends chief activity in a dark corner of the laboratory over a queer incubating burner he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian cellmatter which multiplied and grew puffily and hideouslyon the night of which i speak we had a splendid new specimena man at once physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured it was rather ironic for he was the officer who had helped west to his commission and who was now to have been our associate moreover he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under west major sir eric moreland claphamlee dso was the greatest surgeon in our division and had been hastily assigned to the st eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters he had come in an aroplane piloted by the intrepid lieut ronald hill only to be shot down when directly over his destination the fall had been spectacular and awful hill was unrecognisable afterward but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition west had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and fellowscholar and i shuddered when he finished severing the head placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptiletissue to preserve it for future experiments and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table he injected new blood joined certain veins arteries and nerves at the headless neck and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officers uniform i knew what he wantedto see if this highly organised body could exhibit without its head any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished sir eric moreland claphamlee once a student of reanimation this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify iti can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body the scene i cannot describei should faint if i tried it for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things with blood and lesser human debris almost ankledeep on the slimy floor and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting bubbling and baking over a winking bluishgreen spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadowsthe specimen as west repeatedly observed had a splendid nervous system much was expected of it and as a few twitching motions began to appear i could see the feverish interest on wests face he was ready i think to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness reason and personality can exist independently of the brainthat man has no central connective spirit but is merely a machine of nervous matter each section more or less complete in itself in one triumphant demonstration west was about to relegate the mystery of life to the category of myth the body now twitched more vigorously and beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way the arms stirred disquietingly the legs drew up and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperationan intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of herbert west certainly the nerves were recalling the mans last act in life the struggle to get free of the falling aroplanewhat followed i shall never positively know it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german shellfirewho can gainsay it since west and i were the only proved survivors west liked to think that before his recent disappearance but there were times when he could not for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination the hideous occurrence itself was very simple notable only for what it impliedthe body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping and we had heard a sound i should not call that sound a voice for it was too awful and yet its timbre was not the most awful thing about it neither was its messageit had merely screamed jump ronald for gods sake jump the awful thing was its sourcefor it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadowsvi the tomblegionswhen dr herbert west disappeared a year ago the boston police questioned me closely they suspected that i was holding something back and perhaps suspected graver things but i could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it they knew indeed that west had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men for his hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect secrecy but the final soulshattering catastrophe held elements of daemoniac phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what i sawi was wests closest friend and only confidential assistant we had met years before in medical school and from the first i had shared his terrible researches he had slowly tried to perfect a solution which injected into the veins of the newly deceased would restore life a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions still more shocking were the products of some of the experimentsgrisly masses of flesh that had been dead but that west waked to a blind brainless nauseous animation these were the usual results for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate braincellsthis need for very fresh corpses had been wests moral undoing they were hard to get and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous a struggle a needle and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique toward the last i became acutely afraid of west for he began to look at me that way people did not seem to notice his glances but they noticed my fear and after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicionswest in reality was more afraid than i for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow partly it was the police he feared but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life and from which he had not seen that life depart he usually finished his experiments with a revolver but a few times he had not been quick enough there was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen there was also that arkham professors body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at sefton where it beat the walls for sixteen years most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak offor in later years wests scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies or parts joined to organic matter other than human it had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print the great war through which both of us served as surgeons had intensified this side of westin saying that wests fear of his specimens was nebulous i have in mind particularly its complex nature part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless monsters while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him their disappearance added horror to the situationof them all west knew the whereabouts of only one the pitiful asylum thing then there was a more subtle feara very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the canadian army in 1915 west in the midst of a severe battle had reanimated major sir eric moreland claphamlee dso a fellowphysician who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them the head had been removed so that the possibilities of quasiintelligent life in the trunk might be investigated just as the building was wiped out by a german shell there had been a success the trunk had moved intelligently and unbelievable to relate we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory the shell had been merciful in a waybut west could never feel as certain as he wished that we two were the only survivors he used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the deadwests last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance overlooking one of the oldest buryinggrounds in boston he had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies the laboratory was in a subcellar secretly constructed by imported workmen and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal of such bodies or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner during the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient masonry undoubtedly connected with the old buryingground yet far too deep to correspond with any known sepulchre therein after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills where the last interment had been made in 1768 i was with him when he studied the nitrous dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of the men and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the uncovering of centuried gravesecrets but for the first time wests new timidity conquered his natural curiosity and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over thus it remained till that final hellish night part of the walls of the secret laboratory i speak of wests decadence but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing outwardly he was the same to the lastcalm cold slight and yellowhaired with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change he seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and looked over his shoulder even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and pawed at sefton barsthe end of herbert west began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me a strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years something fearsome and incredible had happened at sefton asylum fifty miles away stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police in the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds and their leader had aroused the attendants he was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried his expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on itfor it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass some nameless accident had befallen this man a larger man guided his steps a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady the speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from arkham sixteen years before and upon being refused gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot the fiends had beaten trampled and bitten every attendant who did not flee killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the waxfaced leader by the time help could be summoned every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanishedfrom the hour of reading this item until midnight west sat almost paralysed at midnight the doorbell rang startling him fearfully all the servants were asleep in the attic so i answered the bell as i have told the police there was no wagon in the street but only a group of strangelooking figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice expressprepaid they filed out of the house with a jerky tread and as i watched them go i had an odd idea that they were turning toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted when i slammed the door after them west came downstairs and looked at the box it was about two feet square and bore wests correct name and present address it also bore the inscription from eric moreland claphamlee st eloi flanders six years before in flanders a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of dr claphamlee and upon the detached head whichperhapshad uttered articulate soundswest was not even excited now his condition was more ghastly quickly he said its the finishbut lets incineratethis we carried the thing down to the laboratorylistening i do not remember many particularsyou can imagine my state of mindbut it is a vicious lie to say it was herbert wests body which i put into the incinerator we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box closed the door and started the electricity nor did any sound come from the box after allit was west who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb masonry had been covered up i was going to run but he stopped me then i saw a small black aperture felt a ghoulish wind of ice and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth there was no sound but just then the electric lights went out and i saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanityor worsecould create their outlines were human semihuman fractionally human and not human at allthe horde was grotesquely heterogeneous they were removing the stones quietly one by one from the centuried wall and then as the breach became large enough they came out into the laboratory in single file led by a stalking thing with a beautiful head made of wax a sort of madeyed monstrosity behind the leader seized on herbert west west did not resist or utter a sound then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations wests head was carried off by the waxheaded leader who wore a canadian officers uniform as it disappeared i saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic visible emotionservants found me unconscious in the morning west was gone the incinerator contained only unidentifiable ashes detectives have questioned me but what can i say the sefton tragedy they will not connect with west not that nor the men with the box whose existence they deny i told them of the vault and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed so i told them no more they imply that i am a madman or a murdererprobably i am mad but i might not be mad if those accursed tomblegions had not been so silent,1

there had happened in the teeming and manytowered city of zeth one of those incidents which are prone to take place in all capitals of all worlds nor simply because zeth lies on a planet of strange beasts and stranger vegetation did this incident differ greatly from what might have occurred in london or paris or any of the great governing towns we know through the cleverly concealed dishonesty of an aged but shrewd official the treasury was exhausted no shiningphrulderas of old lay stacked about the strongroom and over empty coffers the sardonic spider wove webs of mocking design when at last thegiphathyalden entered that obscure vault and discovered the thefts there were left only some phlegmatic rats which peered sharply at him as at an alien intruderthere had been no accountings since kishan the old keeper had died many moonturns before and great was yaldens dismay to find this emptiness instead of the expected wealth the indifference of the small creatures in the cracks between the flagstones could not spread itself to him this was a very grave matter and would have to be met in a very prompt and serious way clearly there was nothing to do but consult oorn and oorn was a highly portentous beingoorn though a creature of extremely doubtful nature was the virtual ruler of zeth it obviously belonged somewhere in the outer abyss but had blundered into zeth one night and suffered capture by theshamithpriests the coincidence of its excessively bizarre aspect and its innate gift of mimicry had impressed the sacred brothers as offering vast possibilities hence in the end they had set it up as a god and an oracle organising a new brotherhood to serve itand incidentally to suggest the edicts it should utter and the replies it should give like the delphi and dodona of a later world oorn grew famous as a giver of judgments and solver of riddles nor did its essence differ from them save that it lay infinitely earlier in time and upon an elder world where all things might happen and now yalden being not above the credulousness of his day and planet had set out for the closeguarded and richlyfitted hall wherein oorn brooded and mimicked the promptings of the priestswhen yalden came within sight of the hall with its tower of blue tile he became properly religious and entered the building acceptably in a humble manner which greatly impeded progress according to custom the guardians of the deity acknowledged his obeisance and pecuniary offering and retired behind heavy curtains to ignite the thuribles after everything was in readiness yalden murmured a conventional prayer and bowed low before a curious empty dais studded with exotic jewels for a momentas the ritual prescribedhe stayed in this abased position and when he arose the dais was no longer empty unconcernedly munching something the priests had given it was a large pudgy creature very hard to describe and covered with short grey fur whence it had come in so brief a time only the priests might tell but the suppliant knew that it was oornhesitantly yalden stated his unfortunate mission and asked advice weaving into his discourse the type of flattery which seemed to him most discreet then with anxiety he awaited the oracles response having tidily finished its food oorn raised three small reddish eyes to yalden and uttered certain words in a tone of vast decisivenessgumay ere hfotuol leheht tegafter this it vanished suddenly in a cloud of pink smoke which seemed to issue from behind the curtain where the acolytes were the acolytes then came forth from their hidingplace and spoke to yalden saying since you have pleased the deity with your concise statement of a very deplorable state of affairs we are honored by interpreting its directions the aphorism you heard signifies no less than the equally mystic phrase go thou unto thy destination or more properly speaking you are to slay the monsterwizard anathas and replenish the treasury with its fabled hoardwith this yalden was dismissed from the temple it may not be said in veracity that he was fearless for in truth he was openly afraid of the monster anathas as were all the inhabitants of ullathia and the surrounding land even those who doubted its actuality would not have chosen to reside in the immediate neighborhood of the cave of three winds wherein it was said to dwellbut the prospect was not without romantic appeal and yalden was young and consequently unwise he knew among other things that there was always the hope of rescuing some feminine victim of the monsters famed and surprising erotic taste of the true aspect of anathas none could be certain tales of a widely opposite nature being commonly circulated many vowed it had been seen from afar in the form of a giant black shadow peculiarly repugnant to human taste while others alleged it was a mound of gelatinous substance that oozed hatefully in the manner of putrescent flesh still others claimed they had seen it as a monstrous insect with astonishing supernumerary appurtenances but in one thing all coincided namely that it was advisable to have as little traffic as possible with anathaswith due supplications to his gods and to their messenger oorn yalden set out for the cave of three winds in his bosom were mixed an ingrained patriotic sense of duty and a thrill of adventurous expectancy regarding the unknown mysteries he faced he had not neglected such preparations as a sensible man might make and a wizard of old repute had furnished him with certain singular accessories he had for example a charm which prevented his thirsting or hungering and wholly did away with his need for provisions there was likewise a glistening cape to counteract the evil emanations of a mineral that lay scattered over the rocky ground along his course other warnings and safeguards dealt with certain gaudy landcrustaceans and with the deathlysweet mists which arise at certain points until dispersed by heliotropismthus shielded yalden fared without incident until he came to the place of the white worm here of necessity he delayed to make preparations for finding the rest of his way with patient diligence he captured the small colorless maggot and surrounded it with a curious mark made with green paint as was prophesied the lord of worms whose name was sarall made promise of certain things in return for its freedom then yalden released it and it crawled away after directing him on the course he was to followthe sere and fruitless land through which he now travelled was totally uninhabited not even the hardier of the beasts were to be seen beyond the edge of that final plateau which separated him from his goal far off in a purplish haze rose the mountains amidst which dwelt anathas it lived not solitary despite the lonely region around for strange pets resided with itsome the fabled elder monsters and others unique beings created by its own fearful craftat the heart of its cave legend said anathas had concealed an enormous hoard of jewels gold and other things of fabulous value why so potent a wonderworker should care for such gauds or revel in the counting of money was by no means clear but many things attested the truth of these tastes great numbers of persons of stronger will and wit than yalden had died in remarkable manners while seeking the hoard of the wizardbeast and their bones were laid in a strange pattern before the mouth of the cave as a warning to otherswhen after countless vicissitudes yalden came at last into sight of the cave of winds amid the glistening boulders he knew indeed that report had not lied concerning the isolation of anathas lair the cavernmouth was wellconcealed and over everything an ominous quiet lowered there was no trace of habitation save of course the ossuary ornamentation in the front yard with his hand on the sword that had been sanctified by a priest of oorn yalden tremblingly advanced when he had attained the very opening of the lair he hesitated no longer for it was evident that the monster was awaydeeming this the best of all times to prosecute his business yalden plunged at once within the cave the interior was very cramped and exceedingly dirty but the roof glittered with an innumerable array of small varicoloured lights the source of which was not to be perceived in the rear yawned another opening either natural or artificial and to this black lowarched burrow yalden hastened crawling within it on hands and knees before long a faint blue radiance glowed at the farther end and presently the searcher emerged into an ampler space straightening up he beheld a most singular change in his surroundings this second cavern was tall and domed as if it had been shapen by supernatural powers and a soft blue and silver light infused the gloom anathas thought yalden lived indeed in comfort for this room was finer than anything in the palace of zeth or even in the temple of oorn upon which had been lavished unthinkable wealth and beauty yalden stood agape but not for long since he desired most of all to seek the object of his quest and depart before anathas should return from wherever it might be for yalden did not wish to encounter the monstersorcerer of which so many tales were told leaving therefore this second cave by a narrow cleft which he saw the seeker followed a devious and unlit way far down through the solid rock of the plateau this he felt would take him to that third and ultimate cavern where his business lay as he progressed he glimpsed ahead of him a curious glow and at last without warning the walls receded to reveal a vast open space paved solidly with blazing coals above which flapped and shrieked an obscene flock of wyvernheaded birds over the fiery surface green monstrous salamanders slithered eyeing the intruder with malignant speculation and on the far side rose the stairs of a metal dais encrusted with jewels and piled high with precious objects the hoard of the wizardbeastat sight of this unattainable wealth yaldens fervour wellnigh overcame him and chaffing at his futility he searched the sea of flame for some way of crossing this he soon perceived was not readily to be found for in all that glowing crypt there was only a slight crescent of flooring near the entrance which a mortal man might hope to walk on desperation however possessed him so that at last he resolved to risk all and try the fiery pavement better to die in the quest than to return emptyhanded with teeth set he started toward the sea of flame heedless of what might followas it was surprise seared him almost as vehemently as he had expected the flames to dofor with his advance the glowing floor divided to form a narrow lane of safe cool earth leading straight to the golden throne half dazed and heedless of whatever might underlie such curiously favouring magic yalden drew his sword and strode boldly betwixt the walls of flame that rose from the rifted pavement the heat hurt him not at all and the wyverncreatures drew back hissing and did not molest himthe hoard now glistened close at hand and yalden thought of how he would return to zeth laden with fabulous spoils and worshipped by throngs as a hero in his joy he forgot to wonder at anathas lax care of its treasures nor did the very friendly behaviour of the fiery pavement seem in any way remarkable even the huge arched opening behind the dais so oddly invisible from across the cavern failed to disturb him seriously only when he had mounted the broad stair of the dais and stood ankledeep amid the bizarre golden reliques of other ages and other worlds and the lovely luminous gems from unknown mines and of unknown natures and meanings did yalden begin to realise that anything was wrongbut now he perceived that the miraculous passage through the flaming floor was closing again leaving him marooned on the dais with the glittering treasure he had sought and when it had fully closed and his eyes had circled round vainly for some way of escape he was hardly reassured by the shapeless jellylike shadow which loomed colossal and stinking in the great archway behind the dais he was not permitted to faint but was forced to observe that this shadow was infinitely more hideous than anything hinted in any popular legend and that its seven iridescent eyes were regarding him with placid amusementthen anathas the wizardbeast rolled fully out of the archway mighty in necromantic horror and jested with the small frightened conqueror before allowing that horde of slavering and peculiarly hungry green salamanders to complete their slow anticipatory ascent of the dais,1
i have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the horror at martins beach despite the large number of witnesses no two accounts agree and the testimony taken by local authorities contains the most amazing discrepanciesperhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheardof character of the horror itself the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it and the efforts made by the fashionable wavecrest inn to hush it up after the publicity created by prof altons article are hypnotic powers confined to recognized humanityagainst all these obstacles i am striving to present a coherent version for i beheld the hideous occurrence and believe it should be known in view of the appalling possibilities it suggests martins beach is once more popular as a wateringplace but i shudder when i think of it indeed i cannot look at the ocean at all now without shudderingfate is not always without a sense of drama and climax hence the terrible happening of august 8 1922 swiftly followed a period of minor and agreeably wonderfraught excitement at martins beach on may 17 the crew of the fishing smackalmaof gloucester under capt james p orne killed after a battle of nearly forty hours a marine monster whose size and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific circles and caused certain boston naturalists to take every precaution for its taxidermic preservationthe object was some fifty feet in length of roughly cylindrical shape and about ten feet in diameter it was unmistakably a gilled fish in its major affiliations but with certain curious modifications such as rudimentary forelegs and sixtoed feet in place of pectoral fins which prompted the widest speculation its extraordinary mouth its thick and scaly hide and its single deepset eye were wonders scarcely less remarkable than its colossal dimensions and when the naturalists pronounced it an infant organism which could not have been hatched more than a few days public interest mounted to extraordinary heightscapt orne with typical yankee shrewdness obtained a vessel large enough to hold the object in its hull and arranged for the exhibition of his prize with judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an excellent marine museum and sailing south to the wealthy resort district of martins beach anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a harvest of admission feesthe intrinsic marvelousness of the object and the importance which it clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and far combined to make it the seasons sensation that it was absolutely uniqueunique to a scientifically revolutionary degreewas well understood the naturalists had shown plainly that it radically differed from the similarly immense fish caught off the florida coast that while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths perhaps thousands of feet its brain and principal organs indicated a development startlingly vast and out of all proportion to anything hitherto associated with the fish tribeon the morning of july 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of the vessel and its strange treasure in the storm of the preceding night it had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the sight of man carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite the threatening weather capt orne backed by extensive scientific interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from gloucester made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise but with no result other than the prompting of interest and conversation by august 7 hope was abandoned and capt orne had returned to the wavecrest inn to wind up his business affairs at martins beach and confer with certain of the scientific men who remained there the horror came on august 8it was in the twilight when grey seabirds hovered low near the shore and a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters the scene is important to remember for every impression counts on the beach were several strollers and a few late bathers stragglers from the distant cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the north or from the adjacent cliffperched inn whose imposing towers proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeurwell within viewing distance was another set of spectators the loungers on the inns highceiled and lanternlighted veranda who appeared to be enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom inside these spectators who included capt orne and his group of scientific confreres joined the beach group before the horror progressed far as did many more from the inn certainly there was no lack of witnesses confused though their stories be with fear and doubt of what they sawthere is no exact record of the time the thing began although a majority say that the fairly round moon was about a foot above the lowlying vapors of the horizon they mention the moon because what they saw seemed subtly connected with ita sort of stealthy deliberate menacing ripple which rolled in from the far skyline along the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams yet which seemed to subside before it reached the shoremany did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events but it seems to have been very marked differing in height and motion from the normal waves around it some called itcunningandcalculatingand as it died away craftily by the black reefs afar out there suddenly came belching up out of the glitterstreaked brine a cry of death a scream of anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked itfirst to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty sturdy fellows in white bathing attire with their calling proclaimed in large red letters across their chests accustomed as they were to rescue work and to the screams of the drowning they could find nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation yet with a trained sense of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their usual coursehastily seizing an aircushion which with its attached coil of rope lay always at hand one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the scene of the gathering crowd whence after whirling it about to gain momentum he flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which the sound had come as the cushion disappeared in the waves the crowd curiously awaited a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been so great eager to see the rescue made by the massive ropebut that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter for pull as they might on the rope the two muscular guards could not move the object at the other end instead they found that object pulling with equal or even greater force in the very opposite direction till in a few seconds they were dragged off their feet and into the water by the strange power which had seized on the proffered lifepreserverone of them recovering himself called immediately for help from the crowd on the shore to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope and in a moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men among whom capt orne was foremost more than a dozen strong hands were now tugging desperately at the stout line yet wholly without availhard as they tugged the strange force at the other end tugged harder and since neither side relaxed for an instant the rope became rigid as steel with the enormous strain the struggling participants as well as the spectators were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the nature of the force in the sea the idea of a drowning man had long been dismissed and hints of whales submarines monsters and demons now passed freely around where humanity had first led the rescuers wonder kept them at their task and they hauled with a grim determination to uncover the mysteryit being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the aircushion capt orne as a natural leader shouted to those on the shore that a boat must be obtained in order to approach harpoon and land the unseen leviathan several men at once prepared to scatter in quest of a suitable craft while others came to supplant the captain at the straining rope since his place was logically with whatever boat party might be formed his own idea of the situation was very broad and by no means limited to whales since he had to do with a monster so much stranger he wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an adult of the species of which the fiftyfoot creature had been the merest infantand now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact which changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror and dazed with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers capt orne turning to leave his post at the rope found his hands held in their place with unaccountable strength and in a moment he realized that he was unable to let go of the rope his plight was instantly divined and as each companion tested his own situation the same condition was encountered the fact could not be deniedevery struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the hempen line which was slowly hideously and relentlessly pulling them out to seaspeechless horror ensued a horror in which the spectators were petrified to utter inaction and mental chaos their complete demoralization is reflected in the conflicting accounts they give and the sheepish excuses they offer for their seemingly callous inertia i was one of them and knoweven the strugglers after a few frantic screams and futile groans succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in the face of unknown powers there they stood in the pallid moonlight blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously backward and forward as the water rose first to their knees then to their hips the moon went partly under a cloud and in the halflight the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping deathharder and harder grew the rope as the tug in both directions increased and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the rising waves slowly the tide advanced till the sands so lately peopled by laughing children and whispering lovers were now swallowed by the inexorable flow the herd of panicstricken watchers surged blindly backward as the water crept above their feet while the frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on half submerged and now at a substantial distance from their audience silence was completethe crowd having gained a huddlingplace beyond reach of the tide stared in mute fascination without offering a word of advice or encouragement or attempting any kind of assistance there was in the air a nightmare fear of impending evils such as the world had never before knownminutes seemed lengthened into hours and still that human snake of swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide rhythmically it undulated slowly horribly with the seal of doom upon it thicker clouds now passed over the ascending moon and the glittering path on the waters faded nearly outvery dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads with now and then the livid face of a backwardglancing victim gleaming pale in the darkness faster and faster gathered the clouds till at length their angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame thunders rolled softly at first yet soon increasing to a deafening maddening intensity then came a culminating crasha shock whose reverberations seemed to shake land and sea alikeand on its heels a cloudburst whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the heavens themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrentthe spectators instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious and coherent thought now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel veranda rumors had reached the guests inside so that the refugees found a state of terror nearly equal to their own i think a few frightened words were uttered but cannot be suresome who were staying at the inn retired in terror to their rooms while others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of bobbing heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning flashes i recall thinking of those heads and the bulging eyes they must contain eyes that might well reflect all the fright panic and delirium of a malignant universeall the sorrow sin and misery blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires fear loathing and anguish of the ages since times beginning eyes alight with all the soulracking pain of eternally blazing infernosand as i gazed out beyond the heads my fancy conjured up still another eye a single eye equally alight yet with a purpose so revolting to my brain that the vision soon passed held in the clutches of an unknown vise the line of the damned dragged on their silent screams and unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and the nightwindthere now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed amidst a blinding glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated in one apocalyptic planetrending peal of cyclopean din it was the end of the storm for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted seathere was no line of bobbing heads now the waters were calm and deserted and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a whirlpool far out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry had first come but as i looked along that treacherous lane of silvery sheen with fancy fevered and senses overwrought there trickled upon my ears from some abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of a laugh,1
there are sacraments of evil as well as of good about us and we live and move to my belief in an unknown world a place where there are caves and shadows and dwellers in twilight it is possible that man may sometimes return on the track of evolution and it is my belief that an awful lore is not yet deadarthur macheninot many weeks ago on a street corner in the village of pascoag rhode island a tall heavily built and wholesomelooking pedestrian furnished much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour he had it appears been descending the hill by the road from chepachet and encountering the compact section had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban at this point without visible provocation he committed his astonishing lapse staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him and then with a series of terrified hysterical shrieks breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing picked up and dusted off by ready hands he was found to be conscious organically unhurt and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack he muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone and with downcast glance turned back up the chepachet road trudging out of sight without once looking behind him it was a strange incident to befall so large robust normalfeatured and capablelooking a man and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised him as the boarder of a wellknown dairyman on the outskirts of chepachethe was it developed a new york police detective named thomas f malone now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident had made dramatic there had been a collapse of several old brick buildings during a raid in which he had shared and something about the wholesale loss of life both of prisoners and of his companions had peculiarly appalled him as a result he had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the ones which had fallen in so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight of such things for an indefinite period a police surgeon with relatives in chepachet had put forward that quaint hamlet of wooden colonial houses as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence and thither the sufferer had gone promising never to venture among the bricklined streets of larger villages till duly advised by the woonsocket specialist with whom he was put in touch this walk to pascoag for magazines had been a mistake and the patient had paid in fright bruises and humiliation for his disobedienceso much the gossips of chepachet and pascoag knew and so much also the most learned specialists believed but malone had at first told the specialists much more ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity was his portion thereafter he held his peace protesting not at all when it was generally agreed that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in the red hook section of brooklyn and the consequent death of many brave officers had unseated his nervous equilibrium he had worked too hard all said in trying to clean up those nests of disorder and violence certain features were shocking enough in all conscience and the unexpected tragedy was the last straw this was a simple explanation which everyone could understand and because malone was not a simple person he perceived that he had better let it suffice to hint to unimaginative people of a horror beyond all human conceptiona horror of houses and blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder worldswould be merely to invite a padded cell instead of restful rustication and malone was a man of sense despite his mysticism he had the celts far vision of weird and hidden things but the logicians quick eye for the outwardly unconvincing an amalgam which had led him far afield in the fortytwo years of his life and set him in strange places for a dublin university man born in a georgian villa near phoenix parkand now as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended malone was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a dauntless fighter to a quivering neurotic what could make old brick slums and seas of dark subtle faces a thing of nightmare and eldritch portent it would not be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide uninterpretedfor was not his very act of plunging into the polyglot abyss of new yorks underworld a freak beyond sensible explanation what could he tell the prosaic of the antique witcheries and grotesque marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison cauldron where all the varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and perpetuate their obscene terrors he had seen the hellish green flame of secret wonder in this blatant evasive welter of outward greed and inward blasphemy and had smiled gently when all the newyorkers he knew scoffed at his experiment in police work they had been very witty and cynical deriding his fantastic pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in these days new york held nothing but cheapness and vulgarity one of them had wagered him a heavy sum that he could notdespite many poignant things to his credit in thedublin revieweven write a truly interesting story of new york low life and now looking back he perceived that cosmic irony had justified the prophets words while secretly confuting their flippant meaning the horror as glimpsed at last could not make a storyfor like the book cited by poes german authorityes lsst sich nicht lesenit does not permit itself to be readiito malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present in youth he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things and had been a poet but poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker directions and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world around daily life had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre shadowstudies now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in beardsleys best manner now hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work of gustave dor he would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries for he argued if superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world but threaten the very integrity of the universe all this reflection was no doubt morbid but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as halfspied and forbidden visions to be lightly played with and hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escapehe had for some time been detailed to the butler street station in brooklyn when the red hook matter came to his notice red hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near the ancient waterfront opposite governors island with dirty highways climbing the hill from the wharves to that higher ground where the decayed lengths of clinton and court streets lead off toward the borough hall its houses are mostly of brick dating from the first quarter to the middle of the nineteenth century and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring antique flavour which conventional reading leads us to call dickensian the population is a hopeless tangle and enigma syrian spanish italian and negro elements impinging upon one another and fragments of scandinavian and american belts lying not far distant it is a babel of sound and filth and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping of oily waves at its grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the harbour whistles here long ago a brighter picture dwelt with cleareyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance where the larger houses line the hill one can trace the relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the buildings the occasional graceful churches and the evidences of original art and background in bits of detail here and therea worn flight of steps a battered doorway a wormy pair of decorative columns or pilasters or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron railing the houses are generally in solid blocks and now and then a manywindowed cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and shipowners watched the seafrom this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred dialects assail the sky hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes and thoroughfares occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains and swarthy sinpitted faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through policemen despair of order or reform and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the contagion the clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative visible offences are as varied as the local dialects and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises that these visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhoods credit unless the power of concealment be an art demanding credit more people enter red hook than leave itor at least than leave it by the landward sideand those who are not loquacious are the likeliest to leavemalone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists he was conscious as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive halfape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances and he had often viewed with an anthropologists shudder the chanting cursing processions of bleareyed and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning one saw groups of these youths incessantly sometimes in leering vigils on street corners sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap instruments of music sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria tables near borough hall and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses they chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the force for he seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret continuity some fiendish cryptical and ancient pattern utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts listed with such conscientious technical care by the police they must be he felt inwardly the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind their coherence and definiteness suggested it and it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their squalid disorder he had not read in vain such treatises as miss murrayswitchcult in western europeand knew that up to recent years there had certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark religions antedating the aryan world and appearing in popular legends as black masses and witches sabbaths that these hellish vestiges of old turanianasiatic magic and fertilitycults were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment suppose and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of them might really beiiiit was the case of robert suydam which took malone to the heart of things in red hook suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient dutch family possessed originally of barely independent means and inhabiting the spacious but illpreserved mansion which his grandfather had built in flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and ivyclad reformed church with its ironrailed yard of netherlandish gravestones in his lonely house set back from martense street amidst a yard of venerable trees suydam had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a generation before when he had sailed for the old world and remained there out of sight for eight years he could afford no servants and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude eschewing close friendships and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three groundfloor rooms which he kept in ordera vast highceiled library whose walls were solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous archaic and vaguely repellent aspect the growth of the town and its final absorption in the brooklyn district had meant nothing to suydam and he had come to mean less and less to the town elderly people still pointed him out on the streets but to most of the recent population he was merely a queer corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair stubbly beard shiny black clothes and goldheaded cane earned him an amused glance and nothing more malone did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound authority on mediaeval superstition and had once idly meant to look up an outofprint pamphlet of his on the kabbalah and the faustus legend which a friend had quoted from memorysuydam became a case when his distant and only relatives sought court pronouncements on his sanity their action seemed sudden to the outside world but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful debate it was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits wild references to impending wonders and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable brooklyn neighbourhoods he had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations or loitering on the benches around borough hall in conversation with groups of swarthy evillooking strangers when he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as sephiroth ashmodai and samal the court action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported from london and paris and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the red hook district where he spent nearly every night receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and foreigners and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the green blinds of secretive windows detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section when however the matter came to a hearing suydam managed to preserve his liberty before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research he was he said engaged in the investigation of certain details of european tradition which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances the notion that any low secret society was preying upon him as hinted by his relatives was obviously absurd and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work triumphing with his calm explanations he was suffered to depart unhindered and the paid detectives of the suydams corlears and van brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgustit was here that an alliance of federal inspectors and police malone with them entered the case the law had watched the suydam action with interest and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives in this work it developed that suydams new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of red hooks devious lanes and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery disorder and the importation of illegal immigrants indeed it would not have been too much to say that the old scholars particular circle coincided almost perfectly with the worst of the organised cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and unclassified asian dregs wisely turned back by ellis island in the teeming rookeries of parker placesince renamedwhere suydam had his basement flat there had grown up a very unusual colony of unclassified slanteyed folk who used the arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by the great mass of syrians in and around atlantic avenue they could all have been deported for lack of credentials but legalism is slowmoving and one does not disturb red hook unless publicity forces one tothese creatures attended a tumbledown stone church used wednesdays as a dancehall which reared its gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the waterfront it was nominally catholic but priests throughout brooklyn denied the place all standing and authenticity and policemen agreed with them when they listened to the noises it emitted at night malone used to fancy he heard terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far underground when the church stood empty and unlighted whilst all observers dreaded the shrieking and drumming which accompanied the visible services suydam when questioned said he thought the ritual was some remnant of nestorian christianity tinctured with the shamanism of thibet most of the people he conjectured were of mongoloid stock originating somewhere in or near kurdistanand malone could not help recalling that kurdistan is the land of the yezidis last survivors of the persian devilworshippers however this may have been the stir of the suydam investigation made it certain that these unauthorised newcomers were flooding red hook in increasing numbers entering through some marine conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police overrunning parker place and rapidly spreading up the hill and welcomed with curious fraternalism by the other assorted denizens of the region their squat figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies grotesquely combined with flashy american clothing appeared more and more numerously among the loafers and nomad gangsters of the borough hall section till at length it was deemed necessary to compute their numbers ascertain their sources and occupations and find if possible a way to round them up and deliver them to the proper immigration authorities to this task malone was assigned by agreement of federal and city forces and as he commenced his canvass of red hook he felt poised upon the brink of nameless terrors with the shabby unkempt figure of robert suydam as archfiend and adversaryivpolice methods are varied and ingenious malone through unostentatious rambles carefully casual conversations welltimed offers of hippocket liquor and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners learned many isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing the newcomers were indeed kurds but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology such of them as worked lived mostly as dockhands and unlicenced pedlars though frequently serving in greek restaurants and tending corner news stands most of them however had no visible means of support and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits of which smuggling and bootlegging were the least indescribable they had come in steamships apparently tramp freighters and had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf and followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house this wharf canal and house malone could not locate for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused while their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters nor could he gain any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation they were reticent about the exact spot from which they had come and were never sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out and directed their course indeed they developed something like acute fright when asked the reasons for their presence gangsters of other breeds were equally taciturn and the most that could be gathered was that some god or great priesthood had promised them unheardof powers and supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange landthe attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at suydams closely guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular and the police soon learned that the erstwhile recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such guests as knew his password at last occupying three entire houses and permanently harbouring many of his queer companions he spent but little time now at his flatbush home apparently going and coming only to obtain and return books and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch of wildness malone twice interviewed him but was each time brusquely repulsed he knew nothing he said of any mysterious plots or movements and had no idea how the kurds could have entered or what they wanted his business was to study undisturbed the folklore of all the immigrants of the district a business with which policemen had no legitimate concern malone mentioned his admiration for suydams old brochure on the kabbalah and other myths but the old mans softening was only momentary he sensed an intrusion and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain way till malone withdrew disgusted and turned to other channels of informationwhat malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the case we shall never know as it was a stupid conflict between city and federal authority suspended the investigations for several months during which the detective was busy with other assignments but at no time did he lose interest or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to robert suydam just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over new york the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd one day he was seen near borough hall with cleanshaved face welltrimmed hair and tastefully immaculate attire and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him he maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of speech and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so long deformed him now frequently taken for less than his age he acquired an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye as the months passed he commenced to dress less and less conservatively and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his flatbush mansion which he threw open in a series of receptions summoning all the acquaintances he could remember and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint some attended through curiosity others through duty but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit he had he asserted accomplished most of his allotted work and having just inherited some property from a halfforgotten european friend was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease care and diet had made possible to him less and less was he seen at red hook and more and more did he move in the society to which he was born policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and dancehall instead of at the basement flat in parker place though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious lifethen two incidents occurredwide enough apart but both of intense interest in the case as malone envisaged it one was a quiet announcement in theeagleof robert suydams engagement to miss cornelia gerritsen of bayside a young woman of excellent position and distantly related to the elderly bridegroomelect whilst the other was a raid on the dancehall church by city police after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows malone had participated in this raid and studied the place with much care when inside nothing was foundin fact the building was entirely deserted when visitedbut the sensitive celt was vaguely disturbed by many things about the interior there were crudely painted panels he did not likepanels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions and which occasionally took liberties that even a laymans sense of decorum could scarcely countenance then too he did not relish the greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit an ancient incantation which he had once stumbled upon in dublin college days and which read literally translatedo friend and companion of night thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals gorgo mormo thousandfaced moon look favourably on our sacrificeswhen he read this he shuddered and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights he shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood on the altar and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood that organ memory haunted him and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he left the place was very hateful to him yet after all were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorantby the time of suydams wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a popular newspaper scandal most of the victims were young children of the lowest classes but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the strongest fury journals clamoured for action from the police and once more the butler street station sent its men over red hook for clues discoveries and criminals malone was glad to be on the trail again and took pride in a raid on one of suydams parker place houses there indeed no stolen child was found despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous the paintings were appallinghideous monsters of every shape and size and parodies on human outlines which cannot be described the writing was in red and varied from arabic to greek roman and hebrew letters malone could not read much of it but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough one frequently repeated motto was in a sort of hebraised hellenistic greek and suggested the most terrible daemonevocations of the alexandrian decadencehel heloym sother emmanvel sabaoth agla tetragrammaton agyros otheos ischyros athanatos iehova va adonai saday homovsion messias eschereheyecircles and pentagrams loomed on every hand and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here in the cellar however the strangest thing was founda pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap and bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls during the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting orientals that swarmed from every door finding nothing relevant they had to leave all as it was but the precinct captain wrote suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants and protgs in view of the growing public clamourvthen came the june wedding and the great sensation flatbush was gay for the hour about high noon and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway no local event ever surpassed the suydamgerritsen nuptials in tone and scale and the party which escorted bride and groom to the cunard pier was if not exactly the smartest at least a solid page from the social register at five oclock adieux were waved and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier slowly turned its nose seaward discarded its tug and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders by night the outer harbour was cleared and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted oceanwhether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention no one can say probably they were simultaneous but it is of no use to calculate the scream came from the suydam stateroom and the sailor who broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not forthwith gone completely madas it is he shrieked more loudly than the first victims and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons the ships doctor who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did not go mad but told nobody what he saw till afterward when he corresponded with malone in chepachet it was murderstrangulationbut one need not say that the clawmark on mrs suydams throat could not have come from her husbands or any other human hand or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in hateful red a legend which later copied from memory seems to have been nothing less than the fearsome chaldee letters of the word lilith one need not mention these things because they vanished so quicklyas for suydam one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself the doctor has distinctly assured malone that he did not seeitthe open porthole just before he turned on the lights was clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence and for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering but no real outline met the eye as proof the doctor points to his continued sanitythen the tramp steamer claimed all attention a boat put off and a horde of swart insolent ruffians in officers dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted cunarder they wanted suydam or his bodythey had known of his trip and for certain reasons were sure he would die the captains deck was almost a pandemonium for at the instant between the doctors report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the tramp not even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners an arab with a hatefully negroid mouth pulled forth a dirty crumpled paper and handed it to the captain it was signed by robert suydam and bore the following odd messagein case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part please deliver me or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the bearer and his associates everything for me and perhaps for you depends on absolute compliance explanations can come laterdo not fail me nowrobert suydamcaptain and doctor looked at each other and the latter whispered something to the former finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the way to the suydam stateroom the doctor directed the captains glance away as he unlocked the door and admitted the strange seamen nor did he breathe easily till they filed out with their burden after an unaccountably long period of preparation it was wrapped in bedding from the berths and the doctor was glad that the outlines were not very revealing somehow the men got the thing over the side and away to their tramp steamer without uncovering it the cunarder started again and the doctor and a ships undertaker sought out the suydam stateroom to perform what last services they could once more the physician was forced to reticence and even to mendacity for a hellish thing had happened when the undertaker asked him why he had drained off all of mrs suydams blood he neglected to affirm that he had not done so nor did he point to the vacant bottlespaces on the rack or to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the bottles original contents the pockets of those menif men they werehad bulged damnably when they left the ship two hours later and the world knew by radio all that it ought to know of the horrible affairvithat same june evening without having heard a word from the sea malone was desperately busy among the alleys of red hook a sudden stir seemed to permeate the place and as if apprised by grapevine telegraph of something singular the denizens clustered expectantly around the dancehall church and the houses in parker place three children had just disappearedblueeyed norwegians from the streets toward gowanusand there were rumours of a mob forming among the sturdy vikings of that section malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt a general cleanup and at last moved by conditions more obvious to their common sense than the conjectures of a dublin dreamer they had agreed upon a final stroke the unrest and menace of this evening had been the deciding factor and just about midnight a raiding party recruited from three stations descended upon parker place and its environs doors were battered in stragglers arrested and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes mitres and other inexplicable devices much was lost in the melee for objects were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts and betraying odours deadened by the sudden kindling of pungent incense but spattered blood was everywhere and malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still risinghe wanted to be in several places at once and decided on suydams basement flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the dilapidated dancehall church the flat he thought must hold some clue to a cult of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the centre and leader and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms noted their vaguely charnel odour and examined the curious books instruments gold ingots and glassstoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and there once a lean blackandwhite cat edged between his feet and tripped him overturning at the same time a beaker half full of a red liquid the shock was severe and to this day malone is not certain of what he saw but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities then came the locked cellar door and the search for something to break it down a heavy stool stood near and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique panels a crack formed and enlarged and the whole door gave waybut from theotherside whence poured a howling tumult of icecold wind with all the stenches of the bottomless pit and whence reached a sucking force not of earth or heaven which coiling sentiently about the paralysed detective dragged him through the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with whispers and wails and gusts of mocking laughterof course it was a dream all the specialists have told him so and he has nothing to prove the contrary indeed he would rather have it thus for then the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul but at the time it was all horribly real and nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts those titan arcades and those halfformed shapes of hell that strode gigantically in silence holding halfeaten things whose still surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert and the black air was alive with the cloudy semivisible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes somewhere dark sticky water was lapping at onyx piers and once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent thing which swam into sight scrambled ashore and climbed up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the backgroundavenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction till one might fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence here cosmic sin had entered and festered by unhallowed rites had commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the graves holding satan here held his babylonish court and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent lilith were laved incubi and succubae howled praise to hecate and headless mooncalves bleated to the magna mater goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes and aegipans chased endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads moloch and ashtaroth were not absent for in this quintessence of all damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down and mans fancy lay open to vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to mould the world and nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed wells of night nor could any sign or prayer check the walpurgisriot of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemonloresuddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms and malone heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead a boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight made fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier and vomited forth several dark men bearing a long burden swathed in bedding they took it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the carved golden pedestal and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding then they unswathed it and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair the phosphorescent thing tittered again and the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its feet with red whilst they afterward gave the bottles to the thing to drink fromall at once from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away there came the daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ choking and rumbling out the mockeries of hell in a cracked sardonic bass in an instant every moving entity was electrified and forming at once into a ceremonial procession the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the soundgoat satyr and aegipan incubus succuba and lemur twisted toad and shapeless elemental dogfaced howler and silent strutter in darknessall led by the abominable naked phosphorescent thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne and that now strode insolently bearing in its arms the glassyeyed corpse of the corpulent old man the strange dark men danced in the rear and the whole column skipped and leaped with dionysiac fury malone staggered after them a few steps delirious and hazy and doubtful of his place in this or in any world then he turned faltered and sank down on the cold damp stone gasping and shivering as the daemon organ croaked on and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter and faintervaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him through the black arcade whilst eventually there rose the dreadful greek incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that dancehall churcho friend and companion of night thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs here a hideous howl burst forth and spilt blood here nameless sounds vied with morbid shriekings who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs here a whistling sigh occurred who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals short sharp cries from myriad throats gorgo repeated as response mormo repeated with ecstasy thousandfaced moon sighs and flute notes look favourably on our sacrificesas the chant closed a general shout went up and hissing sounds nearly drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ then a gasp as from many throats and a babel of barked and bleated wordslilith great lilith behold the bridegroom more cries a clamour of rioting and the sharp clicking footfalls of a running figure the footfalls approached and malone raised himself to his elbow to lookthe luminosity of the crypt lately diminished had now slightly increased and in that devillight there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee or feel or breathethe glassyeyed gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man now needing no support but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed after it raced the naked tittering phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal and still farther behind panted the dark men and all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses the corpse was gaining on its pursuers and seemed bent on a definite object straining with every rotting muscle toward the carved golden pedestal whose necromantic importance was evidently so great another moment and it had reached its goal whilst the trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed but they were too late for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution the staring corpse which had been robert suydam achieved its object and its triumph the push had been tremendous but the force had held out and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered tipped and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower tartarus in that instant too the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before malones eyes and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot out all the evil universeviimalones dream experienced in full before he knew of suydams death and transfer at sea was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case though that is no reason why anyone should believe it the three old houses in parker place doubtless long rotten with decay in its most insidious form collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners were inside and of both the greater number were instantly killed only in the basements and cellars was there much saving of life and malone was lucky to have been deep below the house of robert suydam for he really was there as no one is disposed to deny they found him unconscious by the edge of a nightblack pool with a grotesquely horrible jumble of decay and bone identifiable through dental work as the body of suydam a few feet away the case was plain for it was hither that the smugglers underground canal led and the men who took suydam from the ship had brought him home they themselves were never found or at least never identified and the ships doctor is not yet satisfied with the simple certitudes of the policesuydam was evidently a leader in extensive mansmuggling operations for the canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in the neighbourhood there was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the dancehall church a crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall and in whose chambers some singular and terrible things were discovered the croaking organ was there as well as a vast arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar the walls were lined with small cells in seventeen of whichhideous to relatesolitary prisoners in a state of complete idiocy were found chained including four mothers with infants of disturbingly strange appearance these infants died soon after exposure to the light a circumstance which the doctors thought rather merciful nobody but malone among those who inspected them remembered the sombre question of old delrioan sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae et an ex tali congressu proles nasci queatbefore the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged and yielded forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes the kidnapping epidemic very clearly had been traced home though only two of the surviving prisoners could by any legal thread be connected with it these men are now in prison since they failed of conviction as accessories in the actual murders the carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by malone as of primary occult importance was never brought to light though at one place under the suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging it was choked up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new houses were made but malone often speculates on what lies beneath the police satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous gang of maniacs and mansmugglers turned over to the federal authorities the unconvicted kurds who before their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the yezidi clan of devilworshippers the tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery though cynical detectives are once more ready to combat its smuggling and rumrunning ventures malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details and the suggestive obscurity of the whole case though he is just as critical of the newspapers which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated over a minor sadist cult which they might have proclaimed a horror from the universes very heart but he is content to rest silent in chepachet calming his nervous system and praying that time may gradually transfer his terrible experience from the realm of present reality to that of picturesque and semimythical remotenessrobert suydam sleeps beside his bride in greenwood cemetery no funeral was held over the strangely released bones and relatives are grateful for the swift oblivion which overtook the case as a whole the scholars connexion with the red hook horrors indeed was never emblazoned by legal proof since his death forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise have faced his own end is not much mentioned and the suydams hope that posterity may recall him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled in harmless magic and folkloreas for red hookit is always the same suydam came and went a terror gathered and faded but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on amongst the mongrels in the old brick houses and prowling bands still parade on unknown errands past windows where lights and twisted faces unaccountably appear and disappear ageold horror is a hydra with a thousand heads and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the well of democritus the soul of the beast is omnipresent and triumphant and red hooks legions of bleareyed pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl as they file from abyss to abyss none knows whence or whither pushed on by blind laws of biology which they may never understand as of old more people enter red hook than leave it on the landward side and there are already rumours of new canals running underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor and less mentionable thingsthe dancehall church is now mostly a dancehall and queer faces have appeared at night at the windows lately a policeman expressed the belief that the filledup crypt has been dug out again and for no simply explainable purpose

when the state highway to rutland is closed travellers are forced to take the stillwater road past swamp hollow the scenery is superb in places yet somehow the route has been unpopular for years there is something depressing about it especially near stillwater itself motorists feel subtly uncomfortable about the tightly shuttered farmhouse on the knoll just north of the village and about the whitebearded halfwit who haunts the old buryingground on the south apparently talking to the occupants of some of the gravesnot much is left of stillwater now the soil is played out and most of the people have drifted to the towns across the distant river or to the city beyond the distant hills the steeple of the old white church has fallen down and half of the twentyodd straggling houses are empty and in various stages of decay normal life is found only around pecks general store and fillingstation and it is here that the curious stop now and then to ask about the shuttered house and the idiot who mutters to the deadmost of the questioners come away with a touch of distaste and disquiet they find the shabby loungers oddly unpleasant and full of unnamed hints in speaking of the longpast events brought up there is a menacing portentous quality in the tones which they use to describe very ordinary eventsa seemingly unjustified tendency to assume a furtive suggestive confidential air and to fall into awesome whispers at certain pointswhich insidiously disturbs the listener old yankees often talk like that but in this case the melancholy aspect of the halfmouldering village and the dismal nature of the story unfolded give these gloomy secretive mannerisms an added significance one feels profoundly the quintessential horror that lurks behind the isolated puritan and his strange repressionsfeels it and longs to escape precipitately into clearer airthe loungers whisper impressively that the shuttered house is that of old miss spraguesophie sprague whose brother tom was buried on the seventeenth of june back in 86 sophie was never the same after that funeralthat and the other thing which happened the same dayand in the end she took to staying in all the time wont even be seen now but leaves notes under the backdoor mat and has her things brought from the store by ned pecks boy afraid of somethingthe old swamp hollow buryingground most of all never could be dragged near there since her brotherand the other onewere laid away not much wonder though seeing the way crazy johnny dow rants he hangs around the buryingground all day and sometimes at night and claims he talks with tomand the other then he marches by sophies house and shouts things at herthats why she began to keep the shutters closed he says things are coming from somewhere to get her sometime ought to be stopped but one cant be too hard on poor johnny besides steve barbour always had his opinionsjohnny does his talking to two of the graves one of them is tom spragues the other at the opposite end of the graveyard is that of henry thorndike who was buried on the same day henry was the village undertakerthe only one in milesand never liked around stillwater a city fellow from rutlandbeen to college and full of book learning read queer things nobody else ever heard of and mixed chemicals for no good purpose always trying to invent something newsome newfangled embalmingfluid or some foolish kind of medicine some folks said he had tried to be a doctor but failed in his studies and took to the next best profession of course there wasnt much undertaking to do in a place like stillwater but henry farmed on the sidemean morbid dispositionand a secret drinker if you could judge by the empty bottles in his rubbish heap no wonder tom sprague hated him and blackballed him from the masonic lodge and warned him off when he tried to make up to sophie the way he experimented on animals was against nature and scripture who could forget the state that collie dog was found in or what happened to old mrs akeleys cat then there was the matter of deacon leavitts calf when tom had led a band of the village boys to demand an accounting the curious thing was that the calf came alive after all in the end though tom had found it as stiff as a poker some said the joke was on tom but thorndike probably thought otherwise since he had gone down under his enemys fist before the mistake was discoveredtom of course was half drunk at the time he was a vicious brute at best and kept his poor sister half cowed with threats thats probably why she is such a fearracked creature still there were only the two of them and tom would never let her leave because that meant splitting the property most of the fellows were too afraid of him to shine up to sophiehe stood six feet one in his stockingsbut henry thorndike was a sly cuss who had ways of doing things behind folks backs he wasnt much to look at but sophie never discouraged him any mean and ugly as he was shed have been glad if anybody could have freed her from her brother she may not have stopped to wonder how she could get clear of him after he got her clear of tomwell that was the way things stood in june of 86 up to this point the whispers of the loungers at pecks store are not so unbearably portentous but as they continue the element of secretiveness and malign tension grows tom sprague it appears used to go to rutland on periodic sprees his absences being henry thorndikes great opportunities he was always in bad shape when he got back and old dr pratt deaf and half blind though he was used to warn him about his heart and about the danger of delirium tremens folks could always tell by the shouting and cursing when he was home againit was on the ninth of juneon a wednesday the day after young joshua goodenough finished building his newfangled silothat tom started out on his last and longest spree he came back the next tuesday morning and folks at the store saw him lashing his bay stallion the way he did when whiskey had a hold of him then there came shouts and shrieks and oaths from the sprague house and the first thing anybody knew sophie was running over to old dr pratts at top speedthe doctor found thorndike at spragues when he got there and tom was on the bed in his room with eyes staring and foam around his mouth old pratt fumbled around and gave the usual tests then shook his head solemnly and told sophie she had suffered a great bereavementthat her nearest and dearest had passed through the pearly gates to a better land just as everybody knew he would if he didnt let up on his drinkingsophie kind of sniffled the loungers whisper but didnt seem to take on much thorndike didnt do anything but smileperhaps at the ironic fact that he always an enemy was now the only person who could be of any use to thomas sprague he shouted something in old dr pratts halfgood ear about the need of having the funeral early on account of toms condition drunks like that were always doubtful subjects and any extra delaywith merely rural facilitieswould entail consequences visual and otherwise hardly acceptable to the deceaseds loving mourners the doctor had muttered that toms alcoholic career ought to have embalmed him pretty well in advance but thorndike assured him to the contrary at the same time boasting of his own skill and of the superior methods he had devised through his experimentsit is here that the whispers of the loungers grow acutely disturbing up to this point the story is usually told by ezra davenport or luther fry if ezra is laid up with chilblains as he is apt to be in winter but from there on old calvin wheeler takes up the thread and his voice has a damnably insidious way of suggesting hidden horror if johnny dow happens to be passing by there is always a pause for stillwater does not like to have johnny talk too much with strangerscalvin edges close to the traveller and sometimes seizes a coatlapel with his gnarled mottled hand while he half shuts his watery blue eyeswell sir he whispers henry he went home an got his undertakers fixinscrazy johnny dow lugged most of em for he was always doin chores for henryan says as doc pratt an crazy johnny should help lay out the body doc always did say as how he thought henry talked too muchaboastin what a fine workman he was an how lucky it was that stillwater had a reglar undertaker instead of buryin folks jest as they was like they do over to whitbysuppose says he some fellow was to be took with some of them paralysin cramps like you read about howd a body like it when they lowered him down and begun shovelin the dirt back howd he like it when he was chokin down there under the new headstone scratchin an tearin if he chanced to get back the power but all the time knowin it wasnt no use no sir i tell you its a blessin stillwaters got a smart doctor as knows when a mans dead and when he aint and a trained undertaker who can fix a corpse so hell stay put without no troublethat was the way henry went on talkin most like he was talkin to poor toms remains and old doc pratt he didnt like what he was able to catch of it even though henry did call him a smart doctor crazy johnny kept watchin of the corpse and it didnt make it none too pleasant the way hed slobber about things like he aint cold doc or i see his eyelids move or theres a hole in his arm jest like the ones i git when henry gives me a syringe full of what makes me feel good thorndike shut him up on that though we all knowed hed been givin poor johnny drugs its a wonder the poor fellow ever got clear of the habitbut the worst thing accordin to the doctor was the way the body jerked up when henry begun to shoot it full of embalminfluid hed been boastin about what a fine new formula hed got practicin on cats and dogs when all of a sudden toms corpse began to double up like it was alive and fixin to wrassle land of goshen but doc says he was scared stiff though he knowed the way corpses act when the muscles begin to stiffen well sir the long and short of it is that the corpse sat up an grabbed a holt of thorndikes syringe so that it got stuck in henry hisself an give him as neat a dose of his own embalminfluid as youd wish to see that got henry pretty scared though he yanked the point out and managed to get the body down again and shot full of the fluid he kept measurin more of the stuff out as though he wanted to be sure there was enough and kept reassurin himself as not much had got into him but crazy johnny begun singin out thats what you give lige hopkinss dog when it got all dead an stiff an then waked up agin now youre agoing to get dead an stiff like tom sprague be remember it dont set to work till after a long spell if you dont get muchsophie she was downstairs with some of the neighboursmy wife matildy she thats dead an gone this thirty year was one of them they were all tryin to find out whether thorndike was over when tom came home and whether findin him there was what set poor tom off i may as well say as some folks thought it mighty funny that sophie didnt carry on more nor mind the way thorndike had smiled not as anybody was hintin that henry helped tom off with some of his queer cookedup fluids and syringes or that sophie would keep still if she thought sobut you know how folks will guess behind a bodys back we all knowed the nigh crazy way thorndike had hated tomnot without reason at thatand emily barbour says to my matildy as how henry was lucky to have ol doc pratt right on the spot with a death certificate as didnt leave no doubt for nobodywhen old calvin gets to this point he usually begins to mumble indistinguishably in his straggling dirty white beard most listeners try to edge away from him and he seldom appears to heed the gesture it is generally fred peck who was a very small boy at the time of the events who continues the talethomas spragues funeral was held on thursday june 17th only two days after his death such haste was thought almost indecent in remote and inaccessible stillwater where long distances had to be covered by those who came but thorndike had insisted that the peculiar condition of the deceased demanded it the undertaker had seemed rather nervous since preparing the body and could be seen frequently feeling his pulse old dr pratt thought he must be worrying about the accidental dose of embalmingfluid naturally the story of the laying out had spread so that a double zest animated the mourners who assembled to glut their curiosity and morbid interestthorndike though he was obviously upset seemed intent on doing his professional duty in magnificent style sophie and others who saw the body were most startled by its utter lifelikeness and the mortuary virtuoso made doubly sure of his job by repeating certain injections at stated intervals he almost wrung a sort of reluctant admiration from the townsfolk and visitors though he tended to spoil that impression by his boastful and tasteless talk whenever he administered to his silent charge he would repeat that eternal rambling about the good luck of having a firstclass undertaker whathe would say as if directly addressing the bodyif tom had had one of those careless fellows who bury their subjects alive the way he harped on the horrors of premature burial was truly barbarous and sickeningservices were held in the stuffy best roomopened for the first time since mrs sprague died the tuneless little parlour organ groaned disconsolately and the coffin supported on trestles near the hall door was covered with sicklysmelling flowers it was obvious that a recordbreaking crowd was assembling from far and near and sophie endeavoured to look properly griefstricken for their benefit at unguarded moments she seemed both puzzled and uneasy dividing her scrutiny between the feverishlooking undertaker and the lifelike body of her brother a slow disgust at thorndike seemed to be brewing within her and neighbours whispered freely that she would soon send him about his business now that tom was out of the waythat is if she could for such a slick customer was sometimes hard to deal with but with her money and remaining looks she might be able to get another fellow and hed probably take care of henry well enoughas the organ wheezed intobeautiful isle of somewherethe methodist church choir added their lugubrious voices to the gruesome cacophony and everyone looked piously at deacon leavitteveryone that is except crazy johnny dow who kept his eyes glued to the still form beneath the glass of the coffin he was muttering softly to himselfstephen barbourfrom the next farmwas the only one who noticed johnny he shivered as he saw that the idiot was talking directly to the corpse and even making foolish signs with his fingers as if to taunt the sleeper beneath the plate glass tom he reflected had kicked poor johnny around on more than one occasion though probably not without provocation something about this whole event was getting on stephens nerves there was a suppressed tension and brooding abnormality in the air for which he could not account johnny ought not to have been allowed in the houseand it was curious what an effort thorndike seemed to be making not to look at the body every now and then the undertaker would feel his pulse with an odd airthe reverend silas atwood droned on in a plaintive monotone about the deceasedabout the striking of deaths sword in the midst of this little family breaking the earthly tie between this loving brother and sister several of the neighbours looked furtively at one another from beneath lowered eyelids while sophie actually began to sob nervously thorndike moved to her side and tried to reassure her but she seemed to shrink curiously away from him his motions were distinctly uneasy and he seemed to feel acutely the abnormal tension permeating the air finally conscious of his duty as master of ceremonies he stepped forward and announced in a sepulchral voice that the body might be viewed for the last timeslowly the friends and neighbours filed past the bier from which thorndike roughly dragged crazy johnny away tom seemed to be resting peacefully that devil had been handsome in his day a few genuine sobsand many feigned oneswere heard though most of the crowd were content to stare curiously and whisper afterward steve barbour lingered long and attentively over the still face and moved away shaking his head his wife emily following after him whispered that henry thorndike had better not boast so much about his work for toms eyes had come open they had been shut when the services began for she had been up and looked but they certainly looked naturalnot the way one would expect after two dayswhen fred peck gets this far he usually pauses as if he did not like to continue the listener too tends to feel that something unpleasant is ahead but peck reassures his audience with the statement that what happened isnt as bad as folks like to hint even steve never put into words what he may have thought and crazy johnny of course cant be counted at allit was luella morsethe nervous old maid who sang in the choirwho seems to have touched things off she was filing past the coffin like the rest but stopped to peer a little closer than anyone else except the barbours had peered and then without warning she gave a shrill scream and fell in a dead faintnaturally the room was at once a chaos of confusion old dr pratt elbowed his way to luella and called for some water to throw in her face and others surged up to look at her and at the coffin johnny dow began chanting to himself he knows he knows he kin hear all were asayin and see all were adoin and theyll bury him that waybut no one stopped to decipher his mumbling except steve barbourin a very few moments luella began to come out of her faint and could not tell exactly what had startled her all she could whisper was the way he lookedthe way he looked but to other eyes the body seemed exactly the same it was a gruesome sight though with those open eyes and that high colouringand then the bewildered crowd noticed something which put both luella and the body out of their minds for a moment it was thorndikeon whom the sudden excitement and jostling crowd seemed to be having a curiously bad effect he had evidently been knocked down in the general bustle and was on the floor trying to drag himself to a sitting posture the expression on his face was terrifying in the extreme and his eyes were beginning to take on a glazed fishy expression he could scarcely speak aloud but the husky rattle of his throat held an ineffable desperation which was obvious to allget me home quick and let me be that fluid i got in my arm by mistake heart action this damned excitement too much wait wait dont think im dead if i seem to only the fluidjust get me home and wait ill come to later dont know how long all the time ill be conscious and know whats going on dont be deceived as his words trailed off into nothingness old dr pratt reached him and felt his pulsewatching a long time and finally shaking his head no use doing anythinghes gone heart no goodand that fluid he got in his arm must have been bad stuff i dont know what it isa kind of numbness seemed to fall on all the company new death in the chamber of death only steve barbour thought to bring up thorndikes last choking words was he surely dead when he himself had said he might falsely seem so wouldnt it be better to wait a while and see what would happen and for that matter what harm would it do if doc pratt were to give tom sprague another looking over before burialcrazy johnny was moaning and had flung himself on thorndikes body like a faithful dog dont ye bury him dont ye bury him he aint dead no more nor lige hopkinss dog nor deacon leavitts calf was when he shot em full hes got some stuff he puts into ye to make ye seem like dead when ye aint ye seem like dead but ye know everything whats agoin on and the next day ye come to as good as ever dont ye bury himhell come to under the earth an he cant scratch up hes a good man an not like tom sprague hope to gawd tom scratches an chokes for hours an hours but no one save barbour was paying any attention to poor johnny indeed what steve himself had said had evidently fallen on deaf ears uncertainty was everywhere old doc pratt was applying final tests and mumbling about death certificate blanks and unctuous elder atwood was suggesting that something be done about a double interment with thorndike dead there was no undertaker this side of rutland and it would mean a terrible expense if one were to be brought from there and if thorndike were not embalmed in this hot june weatherwell one couldnt tell and there were no relatives or friends to be critical unless sophie chose to bebut sophie was on the other side of the room staring silently fixedly and almost morbidly into her brothers coffindeacon leavitt tried to restore a semblance of decorum and had poor thorndike carried across the hall to the sittingroom meanwhile sending zenas wells and walter perkins over to the undertakers house for a coffin of the right size the key was in henrys trousers pocket johnny continued to whine and paw at the body and elder atwood busied himself with inquiring about thorndikes denominationfor henry had not attended local services when it was decided that his folks in rutlandall dead nowhad been baptists the reverend silas decided that deacon leavitt had better offer the brief prayerit was a gala day for the funeralfanciers of stillwater and vicinity even luella had recovered enough to stay gossip murmured and whispered buzzed busily while a few composing touches were given to thorndikes cooling stiffening form johnny had been cuffed out of the house as most agreed he should have been in the first place but his distant howls were now and then wafted gruesomely inwhen the body was encoffined and laid out beside that of thomas sprague the silent almost frighteninglooking sophie gazed intently at it as she had gazed at her brothers she had not uttered a word for a dangerously long time and the mixed expression on her face was past all describing or interpreting as the others withdrew to leave her alone with the dead she managed to find a sort of mechanical speech but no one could make out the words and she seemed to be talking first to one body and then the otherand now with what would seem to an outsider the acme of gruesome unconscious comedy the whole funeral mummery of the afternoon was listlessly repeated again the organ wheezed again the choir screeched and scraped again a droning incantation arose and again the morbidly curious spectators filed past a macabre objectthis time a dual array of mortuary repose some of the more sensitive people shivered at the whole proceeding and again stephen barbour felt an underlying note of eldritch horror and daemoniac abnormality god how lifelike both of those corpses were and how in earnest poor thorndike had been about not wanting to be judged dead and how he hated tom sprague but what could one do in the face of common sensea dead man was a dead man and there was old doc pratt with his years of experience if nobody else bothered why should one bother oneself whatever tom had got he had probably deserved and if henry had done anything to him the score was even now well sophie was free at last as the peering procession moved at last toward the hall and the outer door sophie was alone with the dead once more elder atwood was out in the road talking to the hearsedriver from lees livery stable and deacon leavitt was arranging for a double quota of pallbearers luckily the hearse would hold two coffins no hurryed plummer and ethan stone were going ahead with shovels to dig the second grave there would be three livery hacks and any number of private rigs in the cavalcadeno use trying to keep the crowd away from the gravesthen came that frantic scream from the parlour where sophie and the bodies were its suddenness almost paralysed the crowd and brought back the same sensation which had surged up when luella had screamed and fainted steve barbour and deacon leavitt started to go in but before they could enter the house sophie was bursting forth sobbing and gasping about that face at the window that face at the window at the same time a wildeyed figure rounded the corner of the house removing all mystery from sophies dramatic cry it was very obviously the faces ownerpoor crazy johnny who began to leap up and down pointing at sophie and shrieking she knows she knows i seen it in her face when she looked at em and talked to em she knows and shes alettin em go down in the earth to scratch an claw for air but theyll talk to her sos she kin hear em theyll talk to her an appear to her and some day theyll come back an git herzenas wells dragged the shrieking halfwit to a woodshed behind the house and bolted him in as best he could his screams and poundings could be heard at a distance but nobody paid him any further attention the procession was made up and with sophie in the first hack it slowly covered the short distance past the village to the swamp hollow buryinggroundelder atwood made appropriate remarks as thomas sprague was laid to rest and by the time he was through ed and ethan had finished thorndikes grave on the other side of the cemeteryto which the crowd presently shifted deacon leavitt then spoke ornamentally and the lowering process was repeated people had begun to drift off in knots and the clatter of receding buggies and carryalls was quite universal when the shovels began to fly again as the earth thudded down on the coffinlids thorndikes first steve barbour noticed the queer expressions flitting over sophie spragues face he couldnt keep track of them all but behind the rest there seemed to lurk a sort of wry perverse halfsuppressed look of vague triumph he shook his headzenas had run back and let crazy johnny out of the woodshed before sophie got home and the poor fellow at once made frantically for the graveyard he arrived before the shovelmen were through and while many of the curious mourners were still lingering about what he shouted into tom spragues partly filled grave and how he clawed at the loose earth of thorndikes freshly finished mound across the cemetery surviving spectators still shudder to recall jotham blake the constable had to take him back to the town farm by force and his screams waked dreadful echoesthis is where fred peck usually leaves off the story what more he asks is there to tell it was a gloomy tragedy and one can scarcely wonder that sophie grew queer after that that is all one hears if the hour is so late that old calvin wheeler has tottered home but when he is still around he breaks in again with that damnably suggestive and insidious whisper sometimes those who hear him dread to pass either the shuttered house or the graveyard afterward especially after darkheh heh fred was only a little shaver then and dont remember no more than half of what was goin on you want to know why sophie keeps her house shuttered and why crazy johnny still keeps atalkin to the dead and ashoutin at sophies windows well sir i dont knows i know all there is to know but i hear what i hearhere the old man ejects his cud of tobacco and leans forward to buttonhole the listenerit was that same night mind yetoward mornin and just eight hours after them burialswhen we heard the first scream from sophies house woke us all upsteve and emily barbour and me and matildy goes over hotfootin all in night gear and finds sophie all dressed and dead fainted on the settinroom floor lucky she hadnt locked the door when we got her to she was shakin like a leaf and wouldnt let on by so much as a word what was ailin her matildy and emily done what they could to quiet her down but steve whispered things to me as didnt make me none too easy come about an hour when we allowed wed be goin home soon that sophie she begun to tip her head on one side like she was alistenin to somethin then on a sudden she screamed again and keeled over in another faintwell sir im tellin what im tellin and wont do no guessin like steve barbour would a done if he dared he always was the greatest hand for hintin things died ten years ago of pneumony what we heard so faintlike was just poor crazy johnny of course taint more than a mile to the buryinground and he must a got out of the window where theyd locked him up at the town farmeven if constable blake says he didnt get out that night from that day to this he hangs around them graves atalkin to the both of themcussin and kickin at toms mound and puttin posies and things on henrys and when he aint adoin that hes hangin around sophies shuttered windows howlin about whats acomin soon to git hershe wouldnt never go near the buryinground and now she wont come out of the house at all nor see nobody got to sayin there was a curse on stillwaterand im dinged if she aint half right the way things is agoin to pieces these days there certainly was somethin queer about sophie right along once when sally hopkins was acallin on herin 97 or 98 i think it wasthere was an awful rattlin at her windersand johnny was safe locked up at the timeat least so constable dodge swore up and down but i aint takin no stock in their stories about noises every seventeenth of june or about faint shinin figures atryin sophies door and winders every black mornin about two oclockyou see it was about two oclock in the mornin that sophie heard the sounds and keeled over twice that first night after the buryin steve and me and matildy and emily heard the second lot faint as it was just like i told you and im atellin you again as how it must a been crazy johnny over to the buryinground let jotham blake claim what he will there aint no tellin the sound of a mans voice so far off and with our heads full of nonsense it aint no wonder we thought there was two voicesand voices that hadnt ought to be speakin at allsteve he claimed to have heard more than i did i verily believe he took some stock in ghosts matildy and emily was so scared they didnt remember what they heard and curious enough nobody else in townif anybody was awake at the ungodly hournever said nothin about hearin no sounds at allwhatever it was was so faint it might have been the wind if there hadnt been words i made out a few but dont want to say as id back up all steve claimed to have caught shedevil all the time henry and alive was plain and so was you know said youd stand by get rid of him and bury me in a kind of changed voice then there was that awful comin again some dayin a deathlike squawk but you cant tell me johnny couldnt have made those sounds hey you whats takin you off in such a hurry mebbe theres more i could tell you if i had a mind,1
iit was languid curiosity which first brought stephen jones to rogers museum someone had told him about the queer underground place in southwark street across the river where waxen things so much more horrible than the worst effigies at madame tussauds were shewn and he had strolled in one april day to see how disappointing he would find it oddly he was not disappointed there was something different and distinctive here after all of course the usual gory commonplaces were presentlandru dr crippen madame demers rizzio lady jane grey endless maimed victims of war and revolution and monsters like gilles de rais and marquis de sadebut there were other things which had made him breathe faster and stay till the ringing of the closing bell the man who had fashioned this collection could be no ordinary mountebank there was imaginationeven a kind of diseased geniusin some of this stufflater he had learned about george rogers the man had been on the tussaud staff but some trouble had developed which led to his discharge there were aspersions on his sanity and tales of his crazy forms of secret worshipthough latterly his success with his own basement museum had dulled the edge of some criticisms while sharpening the insidious point of others teratology and the iconography of nightmare were his hobbies and even he had had the prudence to screen off some of his worst effigies in a special alcove for adults only it was this alcove which had fascinated jones so much there were lumpish hybrid things which only fantasy could spawn moulded with devilish skill and coloured in a horribly lifelike fashionsome were the figures of wellknown mythgorgons chimaeras dragons cyclops and all their shuddersome congeners others were drawn from darker and more furtively whispered cycles of subterranean legendblack formless tsathoggua manytentacled cthulhu proboscidian chaugnar faugn and other rumoured blasphemies from forbidden books like thenecronomiconthebook of eibonor theunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt but the worst were wholly original with rogers and represented shapes which no tale of antiquity had ever dared to suggest several were hideous parodies on forms of organic life we know while others seemed taken from feverish dreams of other planets and other galaxies the wilder paintings of clark ashton smith might suggest a fewbut nothing could suggest the effect of poignant loathsome terror created by their great size and fiendishly cunning workmanship and by the diabolically clever lighting conditions under which they were exhibitedstephen jones as a leisurely connoisseur of the bizarre in art had sought out rogers himself in the dingy office and workroom behind the vaulted museum chamberan evillooking crypt lighted dimly by dusty windows set slitlike and horizontal in the brick wall on a level with the ancient cobblestones of a hidden courtyard it was here that the images were repairedhere too where some of them had been made waxen arms legs heads and torsos lay in grotesque array on various benches while on high tiers of shelves matted wigs ravenouslooking teeth and glassy staring eyes were indiscriminately scattered costumes of all sorts hung from hooks and in one alcove were great piles of fleshcoloured waxcakes and shelves filled with paintcans and brushes of every description in the centre of the room was a large meltingfurnace used to prepare the wax for moulding its firebox topped by a huge iron container on hinges with a spout which permitted the pouring of melted wax with the merest touch of a fingerother things in the dismal crypt were less describableisolated parts of problematical entities whose assembled forms were the phantoms of delirium at one end was a door of heavy plank fastened by an unusually large padlock and with a very peculiar symbol painted over it jones who had once had access to the dreadednecronomiconshivered involuntarily as he recognised that symbol this showman he reflected must indeed be a person of disconcertingly wide scholarship in dark and dubious fieldsnor did the conversation of rogers disappoint him the man was tall lean and rather unkempt with large black eyes which gazed combustively from a pallid and usually stubblecovered face he did not resent joness intrusion but seemed to welcome the chance of unburdening himself to an interested person his voice was of singular depth and resonance and harboured a sort of repressed intensity bordering on the feverish jones did not wonder that many had thought him madwith every successive calland such calls became a habit as the weeks went byjones had found rogers more communicative and confidential from the first there had been hints of strange faiths and practices on the showmans part and later on these hints expanded into talesdespite a few odd corroborative photographswhose extravagance was almost comic it was some time in june on a night when jones had brought a bottle of good whiskey and plied his host somewhat freely that the really demented talk first appeared before that there had been wild enough storiesaccounts of mysterious trips to thibet the african interior the arabian desert the amazon valley alaska and certain littleknown islands of the south pacific plus claims of having read such monstrous and halffabulous books as the prehistoric pnakotic fragments and the dhol chants attributed to malign and nonhuman lengbut nothing in all this had been so unmistakably insane as what had cropped out that june evening under the spell of the whiskeyto be plain rogers began making vague boasts of having found certain things in nature that no one had found before and of having brought back tangible evidences of such discoveries according to his bibulous harangue he had gone farther than anyone else in interpreting the obscure and primal books he studied and had been directed by them to certain remote places where strange survivals are hiddensurvivals of aeons and lifecycles earlier than mankind and in some cases connected with other dimensions and other worlds communication with which was frequent in the forgotten prehuman days jones marvelled at the fancy which could conjure up such notions and wondered just what rogers mental history had been had his work amidst the morbid grotesqueries of madame tussauds been the start of his imaginative flights or was the tendency innate so that his choice of occupation was merely one of its manifestations at any rate the mans work was very closely linked with his notions even now there was no mistaking the trend of his blackest hints about the nightmare monstrosities in the screenedoff adults only alcove heedless of ridicule he was trying to imply that not all of these daemoniac abnormalities were artificialit was joness frank scepticism and amusement at these irresponsible claims which broke up the growing cordiality rogers it was clear took himself very seriously for he now became morose and resentful continuing to tolerate jones only through a dogged urge to break down his wall of urbane and complacent incredulity wild tales and suggestions of rites and sacrifices to nameless elder gods continued and now and then rogers would lead his guest to one of the hideous blasphemies in the screenedoff alcove and point out features difficult to reconcile with even the finest human craftsmanship jones continued his visits through sheer fascination though he knew he had forfeited his hosts regard at times he would try to humour rogers with pretended assent to some mad hint or assertion but the gaunt showman was seldom to be deceived by such tacticsthe tension came to a head later in september jones had casually dropped into the museum one afternoon and was wandering through the dim corridors whose horrors were now so familiar when he heard a very peculiar sound from the general direction of rogers workroom others heard it too and started nervously as the echoes reverberated through the great vaulted basement the three attendants exchanged odd glances and one of them a dark taciturn foreignlooking fellow who always served rogers as a repairer and assistant designer smiled in a way which seemed to puzzle his colleagues and which grated very harshly on some facet of joness sensibilities it was the yelp or scream of a dog and was such a sound as could be made only under conditions of the utmost fright and agony combined its stark anguished frenzy was appalling to hear and in this setting of grotesque abnormality it held a double hideousness jones remembered that no dogs were allowed in the museumhe was about to go to the door leading into the workroom when the dark attendant stopped him with a word and a gesture mr rogers the man said in a soft somewhat accented voice at once apologetic and vaguely sardonic was out and there were standing orders to admit no one to the workroom during his absence as for that yelp it was undoubtedly something out in the courtyard behind the museum this neighbourhood was full of stray mongrels and their fights were sometimes shockingly noisy there were no dogs in any part of the museum but if mr jones wished to see mr rogers he might find him just before closingtimeafter this jones climbed the old stone steps to the street outside and examined the squalid neighbourhood curiously the leaning decrepit buildingsonce dwellings but now largely shops and warehouseswere very ancient indeed some of them were of a gabled type seeming to go back to tudor times and a faint miasmatic stench hung subtly about the whole region beside the dingy house whose basement held the museum was a low archway pierced by a dark cobbled alley and this jones entered in a vague wish to find the courtyard behind the workroom and settle the affair of the dog more comfortably in his mind the courtyard was dim in the late afternoon light hemmed in by rear walls even uglier and more intangibly menacing than the crumbling street facades of the evil old houses not a dog was in sight and jones wondered how the aftermath of such a frantic turmoil could have completely vanished so soondespite the assistants statement that no dog had been in the museum jones glanced nervously at the three small windows of the basement workroomnarrow horizontal rectangles close to the grassgrown pavement with grimy panes that stared repulsively and incuriously like the eyes of dead fish to their left a worn flight of steps led to an opaque and heavily bolted door some impulse urged him to crouch low on the damp broken cobblestones and peer in on the chance that the thick green shades worked by long cords that hung down to a reachable level might not be drawn the outer surfaces were thick with dirt but as he rubbed them with his handkerchief he saw there was no obscuring curtain in the way of his visionso shadowed was the cellar from the inside that not much could be made out but the grotesque working paraphernalia now and then loomed up spectrally as jones tried each of the windows in turn it seemed evident at first that no one was within yet when he peered through the extreme righthand windowthe one nearest the entrance alleyhe saw a glow of light at the farther end of the apartment which made him pause in bewilderment there was no reason why any light should be there it was an inner side of the room and he could not recall any gas or electric fixture near that point another look defined the glow as a large vertical rectangle and a thought occurred to him it was in that direction that he had always noticed the heavy plank door with the abnormally large padlockthe door which was never opened and above which was crudely smeared that hideous cryptic symbol from the fragmentary records of forbidden elder magic it must be open nowand there was a light inside all his former speculations as to where that door led and as to what lay behind it were now renewed with trebly disquieting forcejones wandered aimlessly around the dismal locality till close to six oclock when he returned to the museum to make the call on rogers he could hardly tell why he wished so especially to see the man just then but there must have been some subconscious misgivings about that terribly unplaceable canine scream of the afternoon and about the glow of light in that disturbing and usually unopened inner doorway with the heavy padlock the attendants were leaving as he arrived and he thought that orabonathe dark foreignlooking assistanteyed him with something like sly repressed amusement he did not relish that lookeven though he had seen the fellow turn it on his employer many timesthe vaulted exhibition room was ghoulish in its desertion but he strode quickly through it and rapped at the door of the office and workroom response was slow in coming though there were footsteps inside finally in response to a second knock the lock rattled and the ancient sixpanelled portal creaked reluctantly open to reveal the slouching feverisheyed form of george rogers from the first it was clear that the showman was in an unusual mood there was a curious mixture of reluctance and actual gloating in his welcome and his talk at once veered to extravagances of the most hideous and incredible sortsurviving elder godsnameless sacrificesthe other than artificial nature of some of the alcove horrorsall the usual boasts but uttered in a tone of peculiarly increasing confidence obviously jones reflected the poor fellows madness was gaining on him from time to time rogers would send furtive glances toward the heavy padlocked inner door at the end of the room or toward a piece of coarse burlap on the floor not far from it beneath which some small object appeared to be lying jones grew more nervous as the moments passed and began to feel as hesitant about mentioning the afternoons oddities as he had formerly been anxious to do sorogers sepulchrally resonant bass almost cracked under the excitement of his fevered ramblingdo you remember he shouted what i told you about that ruined city in indochina where the tchotchos lived you had to admit id been there when you saw the photographs even if you did think i made that oblong swimmer in darkness out of wax if youd seen it writhing in the underground pools as i did well this is bigger still i never told you about this because i wanted to work out the later parts before making any claim when you see the snapshots youll know the geography couldnt have been faked and i fancy i have another way of proving thatitisnt any waxed concoction of mine youve never seen it for the experiments wouldnt let me keep it on exhibitionthe showman glanced queerly at the padlocked doorit all comes from that long ritual in the eighth pnakotic fragment when i got it figured out i saw it could have only one meaning there were things in the north before the land of lomarbefore mankind existedand this was one of them it took us all the way to alaska and up the noatak from fort morton but the thing was there as we knew it would be great cyclopean ruins acres of them there was less left than we had hoped for but after three million years what could one expect and werent the esquimau legends all in the right direction we couldnt get one of the beggars to go with us and had to sledge all the way back to nome for americans orabona was no good up in that climateit made him sullen and hatefulill tell you later how we found it when we got the ice blasted out of the pylons of the central ruin the stairway was just as we knew it would be some carvings still there and it was no trouble keeping the yankees from following us in orabona shivered like a leafyoud never think it from the damned insolent way he struts around here he knew enough of the elder lore to be properly afraid the eternal light was gone but our torches shewed enough we saw the bones of others who had been before usaeons ago when the climate was warm some of these bones were of things you couldnt even imagine at the third level down we found the ivory throne the fragments said so much aboutand i may as well tell you it wasnt emptythe thing on that throne didnt moveand we knew then that it needed the nourishment of sacrifice but we didnt want to wake it then better to get it to london first orabona and i went to the surface for the big box but when we had packed it we couldnt get it up the three flights of steps these steps werent made for human beings and their size bothered us anyway it was devilish heavy we had to have the americans down to get it out they werent anxious to go into the place but of course the worst thing was safely inside the box we told them it was a batch of ivory carvingsarchaeological stuff and after seeing the carved throne they probably believed us its a wonder they didnt suspect hidden treasure and demand a share they must have told queer tales around nome later on though i doubt if they ever went back to those ruins even for the ivory thronerogers paused felt around in his desk and produced an envelope of goodsized photographic prints extracting one and laying it face down before him he handed the rest to jones the set was certainly an odd one iceclad hills dog sledges men in furs and vast tumbled ruins against a background of snowruins whose bizarre outlines and enormous stone blocks could hardly be accounted for one flashlight view shewed an incredible interior chamber with wild carvings and a curious throne whose proportion could not have been designed for a human occupant the carvings on the gigantic masonryhigh walls and peculiar vaulting overheadwere mainly symbolic and involved both wholly unknown designs and certain hieroglyphs darkly cited in obscene legends over the throne loomed the same dreadful symbol which was now painted on the workroom wall above the padlocked plank door jones darted a nervous glance at the closed portal assuredly rogers had been to strange places and had seen strange things yet this mad interior picture might easily be a fraudtaken from a very clever stage setting one must not be too credulous but rogers was continuingwell we shipped the box from nome and got to london without any trouble that was the first time wed ever brought back anything that had a chance of coming alive i didnt put it on display because there were more important things to do for it it needed the nourishment of sacrifice for it was a god of course i couldnt get it the sort of sacrifices which it used to have in its day for such things dont exist now but there were other things which might do the blood is the life you know even the lemurs and elementals that are older than the earth will come when the blood of men or beasts is offered under the right conditionsthe expression on the narrators face was growing very alarming and repulsive so that jones fidgeted involuntarily in his chair rogers seemed to notice his guests nervousness and continued with a distinctly evil smileit was last year that i got it and ever since then ive been trying rites and sacrifices orabona hasnt been much help for he was always against the idea of waking it he hates itprobably because hes afraid of what it will come to mean he carries a pistol all the time to protect himselffool as if there were human protection against it if i ever see him draw that pistol ill strangle him he wanted me to kill it and make an effigy of it but ive stuck by my plans and im coming out on top in spite of all the cowards like orabona and damned sniggering sceptics like you jones ive chanted the rites and made certain sacrificesand last week the transition camethe sacrifice wasreceived and enjoyedrogers actually licked his lips while jones held himself uneasily rigid the showman paused and rose crossing the room to the piece of burlap at which he had glanced so often bending down he took hold of one corner as he spoke againyouve laughed enough at my worknow its time for you to get some facts orabona tells me you heard a dog screaming around here this afternoondo you know what that meantjones started for all his curiosity he would have been glad to get out without further light on the point which had so puzzled him but rogers was inexorable and began to lift the square of burlap beneath it lay a crushed almost shapeless mass which jones was slow to classify was it a onceliving thing which some agency had flattened sucked dry of blood punctured in a thousand places and wrung into a limp brokenboned heap of grotesqueness after a moment jones realised what it must be it was what was left of a doga dog perhaps of considerable size and whitish colour its breed was past recognition for distortion had come in nameless and hideous ways most of the hair was burned off as by some pungent acid and the exposed bloodless skin was riddled by innumerable circular wounds or incisions the form of torture necessary to cause such results was past imaginingelectrified with a pure loathing which conquered his mounting disgust jones sprang up with a cryyou damned sadistyou madmanyou do a thing like this and dare to speak to a decent manrogers dropped the burlap with a malignant sneer and faced his oncoming guest his words held an unnatural calmwhy you fool do you thinkidid this let us admit that the results are unbeautiful from our limited human standpoint what of it it is not human and does not pretend to be to sacrifice is merely to offer i gave the dog toitwhat happened is its work not mine it needed the nourishment of the offering and took it in its own way but let me shew you what it looks likeas jones stood hesitating the speaker returned to his desk and took up the photograph he had laid face down without shewing now he extended it with a curious look jones took it and glanced at it in an almost mechanical way after a moment the visitors glance became sharper and more absorbed for the utterly satanic force of the object depicted had an almost hypnotic effect certainly rogers had outdone himself in modelling the eldritch nightmare which the camera had caught the thing was a work of sheer infernal genius and jones wondered how the public would react when it was placed on exhibition so hideous a thing had no right to existprobably the mere contemplation of it after it was done had completed the unhinging of its makers mind and led him to worship it with brutal sacrifices only a stout sanity could resist the insidious suggestion that the blasphemy wasor had once beensome morbid and exotic form of actual lifethe thing in the picture squatted or was balanced on what appeared to be a clever reproduction of the monstrously carved throne in the other curious photograph to describe it with any ordinary vocabulary would be impossible for nothing even roughly corresponding to it has ever come within the imagination of sane mankind it represented something meant perhaps to be roughly connected with the vertebrates of this planetthough one could not be too sure of that its bulk was cyclopean for even squatted it towered to almost twice the height of orabona who was shewn beside it looking sharply one might trace its approximations toward the bodily features of the higher vertebratesthere was an almost globular torso with six long sinuous limbs terminating in crablike claws from the upper end a subsidiary globe bulged forward bubblelike its triangle of three staring fishy eyes its footlong and evidently flexible proboscis and a distended lateral system analogous to gills suggesting that it was a head most of the body was covered with what at first appeared to be fur but which on closer examination proved to be a dense growth of dark slender tentacles or sucking filaments each tipped with a mouth suggesting the head of an asp on the head and below the proboscis the tentacles tended to be longer and thicker and marked with spiral stripessuggesting the traditional serpentlocks of medusa to say that such a thing could have anexpressionseems paradoxical yet jones felt that that triangle of bulging fisheyes and that obliquely poised proboscis all bespoke a blend of hate greed and sheer cruelty incomprehensible to mankind because mixed with other emotions not of the world or this solar system into this bestial abnormality he reflected rogers must have poured at once all his malignant insanity and all his uncanny sculptural genius the thing was incredibleand yet the photograph proved that it existedrogers interrupted his reverieswellwhat do you think of it now do you wonder what crushed the dog and sucked it dry with a million mouths it needed nourishmentand it will need more it is a god and i am the first priest of its latterday hierarchy i shubniggurath the goat with a thousand youngjones lowered the photograph in disgust and pitysee here rogers this wont do there are limits you know its a great piece of work and all that but it isnt good for you better not see it any morelet orabona break it up and try to forget about it and let me tear this beastly picture up toowith a snarl rogers snatched the photograph and returned it to the deskidiotyouand you still think its all a fraud you still think i made it and you still think my figures are nothing but lifeless wax why damn you youre a worse clod than a wax image yourself but ive got proof this time and youre going to know not just now for it is resting after the sacrificebut later oh yesyou will not doubt the power of it thenas rogers glanced toward the padlocked inner door jones retrieved his hat and stick from a nearby benchvery well rogers let it be later i must be going now but ill call around tomorrow afternoon think my advice over and see if it doesnt sound sensible ask orabona what he thinks toorogers actually bared his teeth in wildbeast fashionmust be going now eh afraid after all afraid for all your bold talk you say the effigies are only wax and yet you run away when i begin to prove that they arent youre like the fellows who take my standing bet that they darent spend the night in the museumthey come boldly enough but after an hour they shriek and hammer to get out want me to ask orabona eh you twoalways against me you want to break down the coming earthly reign of itjones preserved his calmno rogerstheres nobody against you and im not afraid of your figures either much as i admire your skill but were both a bit nervous tonight and i fancy some rest will do us goodagain rogers checked his guests departurenot afraid ehthen why are you so anxious to go look heredo you or dont you dare to stay alone here in the dark whats your hurry if you dont believe in itsome new idea seemed to have struck rogers and jones eyed him closelywhy ive no special hurrybut what would be gained by my staying here alone what would it prove my only objection is that it isnt very comfortable for sleeping what good would it do either of usthis time it was jones who was struck with an idea he continued in a tone of conciliationsee here rogersive just asked you what it would prove if i stayed when we both know it would prove that your effigies are just effigies and that you oughtnt to let your imagination go the way its been going lately suppose idostay if i stick it out till morning will you agree to take a new view of thingsgo on a vacation for three months or so and let orabona destroy that new thing of yours come nowisnt that fairthe expression on the showmans face was hard to read it was obvious that he was thinking quickly and that of sundry conflicting emotions malign triumph was getting the upper hand his voice held a choking quality as he repliedfair enoughif you do stick it outill take your advice but stick you must well go out for dinner and come back ill lock you in the display room and go home in the morning ill come down ahead of orabonahe comes half an hour before the restand see how you are but dont try it unless you areverysure of your scepticism others have backed outyou have that chance and i suppose a pounding on the outer door would always bring a constable you may not like it so well after a whileyoull be in the same building though not in the same room with itas they left the rear door into the dingy courtyard rogers took with him the piece of burlapweighted with a gruesome burden near the centre of the court was a manhole whose cover the showman lifted quietly and with a shuddersome suggestion of familiarity burlap and all the burden went down to the oblivion of a cloacal labyrinth jones shuddered and almost shrank from the gaunt figure at his side as they emerged into the streetby unspoken mutual consent they did not dine together but agreed to meet in front of the museum at elevenjones hailed a cab and breathed more freely when he had crossed waterloo bridge and was approaching the brilliantly lighted strand he dined at a quiet caf and subsequently went to his home in portland place to bathe and get a few things idly he wondered what rogers was doing he had heard that the man had a vast dismal house in the walworth road full of obscure and forbidden books occult paraphernalia and wax images which he did not choose to place on exhibition orabona he understood lived in separate quarters in the same houseat eleven jones found rogers waiting by the basement door in southwark street their words were few but each seemed taut with a menacing tension they agreed that the vaulted exhibition room alone should form the scene of the vigil and rogers did not insist that the watcher sit in the special adult alcove of supreme horrors the showman having extinguished all the lights with switches in the workroom locked the door of that crypt with one of the keys on his crowded ring without shaking hands he passed out the street door locked it after him and stamped up the worn steps to the sidewalk outside as his tread receded jones realised that the long tedious vigil had commencediilater in the utter blackness of the great arched cellar jones cursed the childish naivet which had brought him there for the first halfhour he had kept flashing on his pocketlight at intervals but now just sitting in the dark on one of the visitors benches had become a more nerveracking thing every time the beam shot out it lighted up some morbid grotesque objecta guillotine a nameless hybrid monster a pastybearded face crafty with evil a body with red torrents streaming from a severed throat jones knew that no sinister reality was attached to these things but after that first halfhour he preferred not to see themwhy he had bothered to humour that madman he could scarcely imagine it would have been much simpler merely to have let him alone or to have called in a mental specialist probably he reflected it was the fellowfeeling of one artist for another there was so much genius in rogers that he deserved every possible chance to be helped quietly out of his growing mania any man who could imagine and construct the incredibly lifelike things that he had produced was surely not far from actual greatness he had the fancy of a sime or a dor joined to the minute scientific craftsmanship of a blatschka indeed he had done for the world of nightmare what the blatschkas with their marvellously accurate plant models of finely wrought and coloured glass had done for the world of botanyat midnight the strokes of a distant clock filtered through the darkness and jones felt cheered by the message from a stillsurviving outside world the vaulted museum chamber was like a tombghastly in its utter solitude even a mouse would be cheering company yet rogers had once boasted thatfor certain reasons as he saidno mice or even insects ever came near the place that was very curious yet it seemed to be true the deadness and silence were virtually complete if only something would make a sound he shuffled his feet and the echoes came spectrally out of the absolute stillness he coughed but there was something mocking in the staccato reverberations he could not he vowed begin talking to himself that meant nervous disintegration time seemed to pass with abnormal and disconcerting slowness he could have sworn that hours had elapsed since he last flashed the light on his watch yet here was only the stroke of midnighthe wished that his senses were not so preternaturally keen something in the darkness and stillness seemed to have sharpened them so that they responded to faint intimations hardly strong enough to be called true impressions his ears seemed at times to catch a faint elusive susurrus which could notquitebe identified with the nocturnal hum of the squalid streets outside and he thought of vague irrelevant things like the music of the spheres and the unknown inaccessible life of alien dimensions pressing on our own rogers often speculated about such thingsthe floating specks of light in his blacknessdrowned eyes seemed inclined to take on curious symmetries of pattern and motion he had often wondered about those strange rays from the unplumbed abyss which scintillate before us in the absence of all earthly illumination but he had never known any that behaved just as these were behaving they lacked the restful aimlessness of ordinary lightspeckssuggesting some will and purpose remote from any terrestrial conceptionthen there was that suggestion of odd stirrings nothing was open yet in spite of the general draughtlessness jones felt that the air was not uniformly quiet there were intangible variations in pressurenot quite decided enough to suggest the loathsome pawings of unseen elementals it was abnormally chilly too he did not like any of this the air tasted salty as if it were mixed with the brine of dark subterrene waters and there was a bare hint of some odour of ineffable mustiness in the daytime he had never noticed that the waxen figures had an odour even now that halfreceived hint was not the way wax figures ought to smell it was more like the faint smell of specimens in a naturalhistory museum curious in view of rogers claims that his figures were not all artificialindeed it was probably that claim which made ones imagination conjure up the olfactory suspicion one must guard against excesses of the imaginationhad not such things driven poor rogers madbut the utter loneliness of this place was frightful even the distant chimes seemed to come from across cosmic gulfs it made jones think of that insane picture which rogers had shewed himthe wildly carved chamber with the cryptic throne which the fellow had claimed was part of a threemillionyearold ruin in the shunned and inaccessible solitudes of the arctic perhaps rogers had been to alaska but that picture was certainly nothing but stage scenery it couldnt normally be otherwise with all that carving and those terrible symbols and that monstrous shape supposed to have been found on that thronewhat a flight of diseased fancy jones wondered just how far he actually was from the insane masterpiece in waxprobably it was kept behind that heavy padlocked plank door leading somewhere out of the workroom but it would never do to brood about a waxen image was not the present room full of such things some of them scarcely less horrible than the dreadful it and beyond a thin canvas screen on the left was the adults only alcove with its nameless phantoms of deliriumthe proximity of the numberless waxen shapes began to get on joness nerves more and more as the quarterhours wore on he knew the museum so well that he could not get rid of their usual images even in the total darkness indeed the darkness had the effect of adding to the remembered images certain very disturbing imaginative overtones the guillotine seemed to creak and the bearded face of landruslayer of his fifty wivestwisted itself into expressions of monstrous menace from the severed throat of madame demers a hideous bubbling sound seemed to emanate while the headless legless victim of a trunk murder tried to edge closer and closer on its gory stumps jones began shutting his eyes to see if that would dim the images but found it was useless besides when he shut his eyes the strange purposeful patterns of lightspecks became more disturbingly pronouncedthen suddenly he began trying to keep the hideous images he had formerly been trying to banish he tried to keep them because they were giving place to still more hideous ones in spite of himself his memory began reconstructing the utterly nonhuman blasphemies that lurked in the obscurer corners and these lumpish hybrid growths oozed and wriggled toward him as though hunting him down in a circle black tsathoggua moulded itself from a toadlike gargoyle to a long sinuous line with hundreds of rudimentary feet and a lean rubbery nightgaunt spread its wings as if to advance and smother the watcher jones braced himself to keep from screaming he knew he was reverting to the traditional terrors of his childhood and resolved to use his adult reason to keep the phantoms at bay it helped a bit he found to flash the light again frightful as were the images it shewed these were not as bad as what his fancy called out of the utter blacknessbut there were drawbacks even in the light of his torch he could not help suspecting a slight furtive trembling on the part of the canvas partition screening off the terrible adults only alcove he knew what lay beyond and shivered imagination called up the shocking form of fabulous yogsothothonly a congeries of iridescent globes yet stupendous in its malign suggestiveness what was this accursed mass slowly floating toward him and bumping on the partition that stood in the way a small bulge in the canvas far to the right suggested the sharp horn of gnophkeh the hairy myththing of the greenland ice that walked sometimes on two legs sometimes on four and sometimes on six to get this stuff out of his head jones walked boldly toward the hellish alcove with torch burning steadily of course none of his fears was true yet were not the long facial tentacles of great cthulhu actually swaying slowly and insidiously he knew they were flexible but he had not realised that the draught caused by his advance was enough to set them in motionreturning to his former seat outside the alcove he shut his eyes and let the symmetrical lightspecks do their worst the distant clock boomed a single stroke could it be only one he flashed the light on his watch and saw that it was precisely that hour it would be hard indeed waiting for morning rogers would be down at about eight oclock ahead of even orabona it would be light outside in the main basement long before that but none of it could penetrate here all the windows in this basement had been bricked up but the three small ones facing the court a pretty bad wait all toldhis ears were getting most of the hallucinations nowfor he could swear he heard stealthy plodding footsteps in the workroom beyond the closed and locked door he had no business thinking of that unexhibited horror which rogers called it the thing was a contaminationit had driven its maker mad and now even its picture was calling up imaginative terrors it could not be in the workroomit was very obviously beyond that padlocked door of heavy planking those steps were certainly pure imaginationthen he thought he heard the key turn in the workroom door flashing on his torch he saw nothing but the ancient sixpanelled portal in its proper position again he tried darkness and closed eyes but there followed a harrowing illusion of creakingnot the guillotine this time but the slow furtive opening of the workroom door he would not scream once he screamed he would be lost there was a sort of padding or shuffling audible now and it was slowly advancing toward him he must retain command of himself had he not done so when the nameless brainshapes tried to close in on him the shuffling crept nearer and his resolution failed he did not scream but merely gulped out a challengewho goes there who are you what do you wantthere was no answer but the shuffling kept on jones did not know which he feared most to doturn on his flashlight or stay in the dark while the thing crept upon him this thing was different he felt profoundly from the other terrors of the evening his fingers and throat worked spasmodically silence was impossible and the suspense of utter blackness was beginning to be the most intolerable of all conditions again he cried out hystericallyhalt who goes thereas he switched on the revealing beams of his torch then paralysed by what he saw he dropped the flashlight and screamednot once but many timesshuffling toward him in the darkness was the gigantic blasphemous form of a black thing not wholly ape and not wholly insect its hide hung loosely upon its frame and its rugose deadeyed rudiment of a head swayed drunkenly from side to side its fore paws were extended with talons spread wide and its whole body was taut with murderous malignity despite its utter lack of facial expression after the screams and the final coming of darkness it leaped and in a moment had jones pinned to the floor there was no struggle for the watcher had faintedjoness fainting spell could not have lasted more than a moment for the nameless thing was apishly dragging him through the darkness when he began recovering consciousness what started him fully awake were the sounds which the thing was makingor rather the voice with which it was making them that voice was human and it was familiar only one living being could be behind the hoarse feverish accents which were chanting to an unknown horrori i it was howling i am coming o rhantegoth coming with the nourishment you have waited long and fed ill but now you shall have what was promised that and more for instead of orabona it will be one of high degree who had doubted you you shall crush and drain him with all his doubts and grow strong thereby and ever after among men he shall be shewn as a monument to your glory rhantegoth infinite and invincible i am your slave and highpriest you are hungry and i provide i read the sign and have led you forth i shall feed you with blood and you shall feed me with power i shubniggurath the goat with a thousand youngin an instant all the terrors of the night dropped from jones like a discarded cloak he was again master of his mind for he knew the very earthly and material peril he had to deal with this was no monster of fable but a dangerous madman it was rogers dressed in some nightmare covering of his own insane designing and about to make a frightful sacrifice to the devilgod he had fashioned out of wax clearly he must have entered the workroom from the rear courtyard donned his disguise and then advanced to seize his neatly trapped and fearbroken victim his strength was prodigious and if he was to be thwarted one must act quickly counting on the madmans confidence in his unconsciousness he determined to take him by surprise while his grasp was relatively lax the feel of a threshold told him he was crossing into the pitchblack workroomwith the strength of mortal fear jones made a sudden spring from the halfrecumbent posture in which he was being dragged for an instant he was free of the astonished maniacs hands and in another instant a lucky lunge in the dark had put his own hands at his captors weirdly concealed throat simultaneously rogers gripped him again and without further preliminaries the two were locked in a desperate struggle of life and death joness athletic training without doubt was his sole salvation for his mad assailant freed from every inhibition of fair play decency or even selfpreservation was an engine of savage destruction as formidable as a wolf or pantherguttural cries sometimes punctured the hideous tussle in the dark blood spurted clothing ripped and jones at last felt the actual throat of the maniac shorn of its spectral mask he spoke not a word but put every ounce of energy into the defence of his life rogers kicked gouged butted bit clawed and spatyet found strength to yelp out actual sentences at times most of his speech was in a ritualistic jargon full of references to it or rhantegoth and to joness overwrought nerves it seemed as if the cries echoed from an infinite distance of daemoniac snortings and bayings toward the last they were rolling on the floor overturning benches or striking against the walls and the brick foundations of the central meltingfurnace up to the very end jones could not be certain of saving himself but chance finally intervened in his favour a jab of his knee against rogers chest produced a general relaxation and a moment later he knew he had wonthough hardly able to hold himself up jones rose and stumbled about the walls seeking the lightswitchfor his flashlight was gone together with most of his clothing as he lurched along he dragged his limp opponent with him fearing a sudden attack when the madman came to finding the switchbox he fumbled till he had the right handle then as the wildly disordered workroom burst into sudden radiance he set about binding rogers with such cords and belts as he could easily find the fellows disguiseor what was left of itseemed to be made of a puzzlingly queer sort of leather for some reason it made joness flesh crawl to touch it and there seemed to be an alien rusty odour about it in the normal clothes beneath it was rogers keyring and this the exhausted victor seized as his final passport to freedom the shades at the small slitlike windows were all securely drawn and he let them remain sowashing off the blood of battle at a convenient sink jones donned the most ordinarylooking and least illfitting clothes he could find on the costume hooks testing the door to the courtyard he found it fastened with a springlock which did not require a key from the inside he kept the keyring however to admit him on his return with aidfor plainly the thing to do was to call in an alienist there was no telephone in the museum but it would not take long to find an allnight restaurant or chemists shop where one could be had he had almost opened the door to go when a torrent of hideous abuse from across the room told him that rogerswhose visible injuries were confined to a long deep scratch down the left cheekhad regained consciousnessfool spawn of nothyidik and effluvium of kthun son of the dogs that howl in the maelstrom of azathoth you would have been sacred and immortal and now you are betraying it and its priest bewarefor it is hungry it would have been orabonathat

great is rhantegoth let me go let me go it is starving down there beyond that door and if it dies the old ones can never come back hei hei let me gojones merely shook his head though the hideousness of the showmans imaginings revolted him rogers now staring wildly at the padlocked plank door thumped his head again and again against the brick wall and kicked with his tightly bound ankles jones was afraid he would injure himself and advanced to bind him more firmly to some stationary object writhing rogers edged away from him and set up a series of frenetic ululations whose utter monstrous unhumanness was appalling and whose sheer volume was almost incredible it seemed impossible that any human throat could produce noises so loud and piercing and jones felt that if this continued there would be no need to telephone for aid it could not be long before a constable would investigate even granting that there were no listening neighbours in this deserted warehouse districtwzayei wzayeihowled the madmanykaa haa bhoii rhantegothcthulhu fhtagnei ei ei eirhantegoth rhantegoth rhantegoththe tautly trussed creature who had started squirming his way across the littered floor now reached the padlocked plank door and commenced knocking his head thunderously against it jones dreaded the task of binding him further and wished he were not so exhausted from the previous struggle this violent aftermath was getting hideously on his nerves and he began to feel a return of the nameless qualms he had felt in the dark everything about rogers and his museum was so hellishly morbid and suggestive of black vistas beyond life it was loathsome to think of the waxen masterpiece of abnormal genius which must at this very moment be lurking close at hand in the blackness beyond the heavy padlocked doorand now something happened which sent an additional chill down joness spine and caused every haireven the tiny growth on the backs of his handsto bristle with a vague fright beyond classification rogers had suddenly stopped screaming and beating his head against the stout plank door and was straining up to a sitting posture head cocked on one side as if listening intently for something all at once a smile of devilish triumph overspread his face and he began speaking intelligibly againthis time in a hoarse whisper contrasting oddly with his former stentorian howlinglisten fool listen hardithas heard me and is coming cant you hear it splashing out of its tank down there at the end of the runway i dug it deep because there was nothing too good for it it is amphibious you knowyou saw the gills in the picture it came to the earth from leadgrey yuggoth where the cities are under the warm deep sea it cant stand up in theretoo tallhas to sit or crouch let me get my keyswe must let it out and kneel down before it then we will go out and find a dog or cator perhaps a drunken manto give it the nourishment it needsit was not what the madman said but the way he said it that disorganised jones so badly the utter insane confidence and sincerity in that crazed whisper were damnably contagious imagination with such a stimulus could find an active menace in the devilish wax figure that lurked unseen just beyond the heavy planking eyeing the door in unholy fascination jones noticed that it bore several distinct cracks though no marks of violent treatment were visible on this side he wondered how large a room or closet lay behind it and how the waxen figure was arranged the maniacs idea of a tank and runway was as clever as all his other imaginingsthen in one terrible instant jones completely lost the power to draw a breath the leather belt he had seized for rogers further strapping fell from his limp hands and a spasm of shivering convulsed him from head to foot he might have known the place would drive him mad as it had driven rogersand now hewasmad he was mad for he now harboured hallucinations more weird than any which had assailed him earlier that night the madman was bidding him hear the splashing of a mythical monster in a tank beyond the doorand now god help himhe did hear itrogers saw the spasm of horror reach joness face and transform it to a staring mask of fear he cackledat last fool you believe at last you know you hear it and it comes get me my keys foolwe must do homage and serve itbut jones was past paying attention to any human words mad or sane phobic paralysis held him immobile and halfconscious with wild images racing phantasmagorically through his helpless imagination therewasa splashing therewasa padding or shuffling as of great wet paws on a solid surface somethingwasapproaching into his nostrils from the cracks in that nightmare plank door poured a noisome animal stench like and yet unlike that of the mammal cages at the zological gardens in regents parkhe did not know now whether rogers was talking or not everything real had faded away and he was a statue obsessed with dreams and hallucinations so unnatural that they became almost objective and remote from him he thought he heard a sniffing or snorting from the unknown gulf beyond the door and when a sudden baying trumpeting noise assailed his ears he could not feel sure that it came from the tightly bound maniac whose image swam uncertainly in his shaken vision the photograph of that accursed unseen wax thing persisted in floating through his consciousness such a thing had no right to exist had it not driven him madeven as he reflected a fresh evidence of madness beset him something he thought was fumbling with the latch of the heavy padlocked door it was patting and pawing and pushing at the planks there was a thudding on the stout wood which grew louder and louder the stench was horrible and now the assault on that door from the inside was a malign determined pounding like the strokes of a batteringram there was an ominous crackinga splinteringa welling foetora falling planka black paw ending in a crablike claw help help god help me aaaaaaa with intense effort jones is today able to recall a sudden bursting of his fearparalysis into the liberation of frenzied automatic flight what he evidently did must have paralleled curiously the wild plunging flights of maddest nightmares for he seems to have leaped across the disordered crypt at almost a single bound yanked open the outside door which closed and locked itself after him with a clatter sprung up the worn stone steps three at a time and raced frantically and aimlessly out of that dank cobblestoned court and through the squalid streets of southwarkhere the memory ends jones does not know how he got home and there is no evidence of his having hired a cab probably he raced all the way by blind instinctover waterloo bridge along the strand and charing cross and up haymarket and regent street to his own neighbourhood he still had on the queer mlange of museum costumes when he grew conscious enough to call the doctora week later the nerve specialists allowed him to leave his bed and walk in the open airbut he had not told the specialists much over his whole experience hung a pall of madness and nightmare and he felt that silence was the only course when he was up he scanned intently all the papers which had accumulated since that hideous night but found no reference to anything queer at the museum how much after all had been reality where did reality end and morbid dream begin had his mind gone wholly to pieces in that dark exhibition chamber and had the whole fight with rogers been a phantasm of fever it would help to put him on his feet if he could settle some of these maddening points hemusthave seen that damnable photograph of the wax image called it for no brain but rogers could ever have conceived such a blasphemyit was a fortnight before he dared to enter southwark street again he went in the middle of the morning when there was the greatest amount of sane wholesome activity around the ancient crumbling shops and warehouses the museums sign was still there and as he approached he saw that the place was open the gateman nodded in a pleasant recognition as he summoned up the courage to enter and in the vaulted chamber below an attendant touched his cap cheerfully perhaps everything had been a dream would he dare to knock at the door of the workroom and look for rogersthen orabona advanced to greet him his dark sleek face was a trifle sardonic but jones felt that he was not unfriendly he spoke with a trace of accentgood morning mr jones it is some time since we have seen you here did you wish mr rogers im sorry but he is away he had word of business in america and had to go yes it was very sudden i am in charge nowhere and at the house i try to maintain mr rogers high standardtill he is backthe foreigner smiledperhaps from affability alone jones scarcely knew how to reply but managed to mumble out a few inquiries about the day after his last visit orabona seemed greatly amused by the questions and took considerable care in framing his repliesoh yes mr jonesthe twentyeighth of last month i remember it for many reasons in the morningbefore mr rogers got here you understandi found the workroom in quite a mess there was a great deal ofcleaning upto do there had beenlate work you see important new specimen given its secondary baking process i took complete charge when i cameit was a hard specimen to preparebut of course mr rogers has taught me a great deal he is as you know a very great artist when he came he helped me complete the specimenhelped very materially i assure youbut he left soon without even greeting the men as i tell you he was called away suddenly there were important chemical reactions involved they made loud noisesin fact some teamsters in the court outside fancy they heard several pistol shotsvery amusing ideaas for the new specimenthat matter is very unfortunate it is a great masterpiecedesigned and made you understand by mr rogers he will see about it when he gets backagain orabona smiledthe police you know we put it on display a week ago and there were two or three faintings one poor fellow had an epileptic fit in front of it you see it is a triflestrongerthan the rest larger for one thing of course it was in the adult alcove the next day a couple of men from scotland yard looked it over and said it was too morbid to be shewn said wed have to remove it it was a tremendous shamesuch a masterpiece of artbut i didnt feel justified in appealing to the courts in mr rogers absence he would not like so much publicity with the police nowbut when he gets backwhen he gets backfor some reason or other jones felt a mounting tide of uneasiness and repulsion but orabona was continuingyou are a connoisseur mr jones i am sure i violate no law in offering you a private view it may besubject of course to mr rogers wishesthat we shall destroy the specimen some daybut that would be a crimejones had a powerful impulse to refuse the sight and flee precipitately but orabona was leading him forward by the arm with an artists enthusiasm the adult alcove crowded with nameless horrors held no visitors in the farther corner a large niche had been curtained off and to this the smiling assistant advancedyou must know mr jones that the title of this specimen is the sacrifice to rhantegothjones started violently but orabona appeared not to noticethe shapeless colossal god is a feature in certain obscure legends which mr rogers has studied all nonsense of course as youve so often assured mr rogers it is supposed to have come from outer space and to have lived in the arctic three million years ago it treated its sacrifices rather peculiarly and horribly as you shall see mr rogers had made it fiendishly lifelikeeven to the face of the victimnow trembling violently jones clung to the brass railing in front of the curtained niche he almost reached out to stop orabona when he saw the curtain beginning to swing aside but some conflicting impulse held him back the foreigner smiled triumphantlybeholdjones reeled in spite of his grip on the railinggodgreat godfully ten feet high despite a shambling crouching attitude expressive of infinite cosmic malignancy a monstrosity of unbelievable horror was shewn starting forward from a cyclopean ivory throne covered with grotesque carvings in the central pair of its six legs it bore a crushed flattened distorted bloodless thing riddled with a million punctures and in places seared as with some pungent acid only the mangled head of the victim lolling upside down at one side revealed that it represented something once humanthe monster itself needed no title for one who had seen a certain hellish photograph that damnable print had been all too faithful yet it could not carry the full horror which lay in the gigantic actuality the globular torsothe bubblelike suggestion of a headthe three fishy eyesthe footlong proboscisthe bulging gillsthe monstrous capillation of asplike suckersthe six sinuous limbs with their black paws and crablike clawsgod the familiarity of that black paw ending in a crablike claw orabonas smile was utterly damnable jones choked and stared at the hideous exhibit with a mounting fascination which perplexed and disturbed him what halfrevealed horror was holding and forcing him to look longer and search out details this had driven rogers mad rogers supreme artist said they werent artificial then he localised the thing that held him it was the crushed waxen victims lolling head and something that it implied this head was not entirely devoid of a face and that face was familiar it was like the mad face of poor rogers jones peered closer hardly knowing why he was driven to do so wasnt it natural for a mad egotist to mould his own features into his masterpiece was there anything more that subconscious vision had seized on and suppressed in sheer terrorthe wax of the mangled face had been handled with boundless dexterity those punctureshow perfectly they reproduced the myriad wounds somehow inflicted on that poor dog but there was something more on the left cheek one could trace an irregularity which seemed outside the general schemeas if the sculptor had sought to cover up a defect of his first modelling the more jones looked at it the more mysteriously it horrified himand then suddenly he remembered a circumstance which brought his horror to a head that night of hideousnessthe tusslethe bound madmanand the long deep scratch down the left cheek of the actual living rogers jones releasing his desperate clutch on the railing sank in a total faintorabona continued to smile,1

intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui the enigmas of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the preraphaelites all were ours in their time but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal only the sombre philosophy of the decadents could hold us and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations baudelaire and huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures it was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear i mention with shame and timiditythat hideous extremity of human outrage the abhorred practice of graverobbingi cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the great stone house where we jointly dwelt alone and servantless our museum was a blasphemous unthinkable place where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and decay to excite our jaded sensibilities it was a secret room far far underground where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings through these pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined eastern shrines of the kingly dead and sometimeshow i shudder to recall itthe frightful soulupheaving stenches of the uncovered gravearound the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermists art and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution there one might find the rotting bald pates of famous noblemen and the fresh and radiantly golden heads of newburied children statues and paintings there were all of fiendish subjects and some executed by st john and myself a locked portfolio bound in tanned human skin held certain unknown and unnamable drawings which it was rumoured goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge there were nauseous musical instruments stringed brass and woodwind on which st john and i sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of tombloot ever assembled by human madness and perversity it is of this loot in particular that i must not speakthank god i had the courage to destroy it long before i thought of destroying myselfthe predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events we were no vulgar ghouls but worked only under certain conditions of mood landscape environment weather season and moonlight these pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression and we gave their details a fastidious technical care an inappropriate hour a jarring lighting effect or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous grinning secret of the earth our quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiatest john was always the leader and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking that accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doomby what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible holland churchyard i think it was the dark rumour and legendry the tales of one buried for five centuries who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre i can recall the scene in these final momentsthe pale autumnal moon over the graves casting long horrible shadows the grotesque trees drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky the phosphorescent insects that danced like deathfires under the yews in a distant corner the odours of mould vegetation and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the nightwind from over far swamps and seas and worst of all the faint deeptoned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place as we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered remembering the tales of the peasantry for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this selfsame spot torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beasti remembered how we delved in this ghouls grave with our spades and how we thrilled at the picture of ourselves the grave the pale watching moon the horrible shadows the grotesque trees the titanic bats the antique church the dancing deathfires the sickening odours the gently moaning nightwind and the strange halfheard directionless baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould and beheld a rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long undisturbed ground it was incredibly tough and thick but so old that we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it heldmuchamazingly muchwas left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred years the skeleton though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had killed it held together with surprising firmness and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long firm teeth and its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our own in the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design which had apparently been worn around the sleepers neck it was the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound or sphinx with a semicanine face and was exquisitely carved in antique oriental fashion from a small piece of green jade the expression on its features was repellent in the extreme savouring at once of death bestiality and malevolence around the base was an inscription in characters which neither st john nor i could identify and on the bottom like a makers seal was graven a grotesque and formidable skullimmediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred the ghastly soulsymbol of the corpseeating cult of inaccessible leng in central asia all too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old arab daemonologist lineaments he wrote drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the deadseizing the green jade object we gave a last glance at the bleached and caverneyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it as we hastened from that abhorrent spot the stolen amulet in st johns pocket we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment but the autumn moon shone weak and pale and we could not be sure so too as we sailed the next day away from holland to our home we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background but the autumn wind moaned sad and wan and we could not be sureiiless than a week after our return to england strange things began to happen we lived as recluses devoid of friends alone and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manorhouse on a bleak and unfrequented moor so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor now however we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night not only around the doors but around the windows also upper as well as lower once we fancied that a large opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off on each occasion investigation revealed nothing and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alonethat same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the holland churchyard the jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum and sometimes we burned strangely scented candles before it we read much in alhazredsnecronomiconabout its properties and about the relation of ghouls souls to the objects it symbolised and were disturbed by what we read then terror cameon the night of september 24 19 i heard a knock at my chamber door fancying it st johns i bade the knocker enter but was answered only by a shrill laugh there was no one in the corridor when i aroused st john from his sleep he professed entire ignorance of the event and became as worried as i it was that night that the faint distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality four days later whilst we were both in the hidden museum there came a low cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase our alarm was now divided for besides our fear of the unknown we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered extinguishing all lights we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air and heard as if receding far away a queer combination of rustling tittering and articulate chatter whether we were mad dreaming or in our senses we did not try to determine we only realised with the blackest of apprehensions that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubtin the dutch languageafter that we lived in growing horror and fascination mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the windswept moor always louder and louder on october 29 we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible to describe they were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old manorhouse in unprecedented and increasing numbersthe horror reached a culmination on november 18 when st john walking home after dark from the distant railway station was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons his screams had reached the house and i had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon my friend was dying when i spoke to him and he could not answer coherently all he could do was to whisper the amuletthat damned thing then he collapsed an inert mass of mangled fleshi buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens and mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life and as i pronounced the last daemoniac sentence i heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound the moon was up but i dared not look at it and when i saw on the dimlitten moor a wide nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound i shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground when i arose trembling i know not how much later i staggered into the house and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jadebeing now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor i departed on the following day for london taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum but after three nights i heard the baying again and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water a wind stronger than the nightwind rushed by and i knew that what had befallen st john must soon befall methe next day i carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for holland what mercy i might gain by returning the thing to its silent sleeping owner i knew not but i felt that i must at least try any step conceivably logical what the hound was and why it pursued me were questions still vague but i had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard and every subsequent event including st johns dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the amulet accordingly i sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when at an inn in rotterdam i discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means of salvationthe baying was loud that evening and in the morning i read of a nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city the rabble were in terror for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighbourhood in a squalid thieves den an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace and those around had heard all night above the usual clamour of drunken voices a faint deep insistent note as of a gigantic houndso at last i stood again in that unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the withered frosty grass and cracking slabs and the ivied church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky and the nightwind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas the baying was very faint now and it ceased altogether as i approached the ancient grave i had once violated and frightened away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around iti know not why i went thither unless to pray or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within but whatever my reason i attacked the halffrozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself excavation was much easier than i expected though at one point i encountered a queer interruption when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the graveearth until i killed him with a blow of my spade finally i reached the rotting oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover this is the last rational act i ever performedfor crouched within that centuried coffin embraced by a closepacked nightmare retinue of huge sinewy sleeping bats was the bony thing my friend and i had robbed not clean and placid as we had seen it then but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair and leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom and when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound and i saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade i merely screamed and ran away idiotically my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughtermadness rides the starwind claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats from nightblack ruins of buried temples of belial now as the baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed webwings circles closer and closer i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable,1
to s lapropos of sleep that sinister adventure of all our nights we may say that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible if we did not know that it is the result of ignorance of the dangerbaudelairemay the merciful gods if indeed there be such guard those hours when no power of the will or drug that the cunning of man devises can keep me from the chasm of sleep death is merciful for there is no return therefrom but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night haggard and knowing peace rests nevermore fool that i was to plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate fool or god thathewasmy only friend who led me and went before me and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be minewe met i recall in a railway station where he was the centre of a crowd of the vulgarly curious he was unconscious having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight blackclad body a strange rigidity i think he was then approaching forty years of age for there were deep lines in the face wan and hollowcheeked but oval and actuallybeautifuland touches of grey in the thick waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus and of a height and breadth almost godlike i said to myself with all the ardour of a sculptor that this man was a fauns statue out of antique hellas dug from a temples ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years and when he opened his immense sunken and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only friendthe only friend of one who had never possessed a friend beforefor i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality realms which i had cherished in fancy but vainly sought so as i drove the crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries and he assented without speaking a word afterward i found that his voice was musicthe music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres we talked often in the night and in the day when i chiselled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalise his different expressionsof our studies it is impossible to speak since they held so slight a connexion with anything of the world as living men conceive it they were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter time and space and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleepthose rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men the cosmos of our waking knowledge born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jesters whim men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly wise men have interpreted dreams and the gods have laughed one man with oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative and men have laughed but even that man with oriental eyes has done no more than suspect i had wished and tried to do more than suspect and my friend had tried and partly succeeded then we both tried together and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old manorhouse in hoary kentamong the agonies of these after days is that chief of tormentsinarticulateness what i learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be toldfor want of symbols or suggestions in any language i say this because from first to last our discoveries partook only of the nature ofsensationssensations correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving they were sensations yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and spacethings which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling themplungingsorsoaringsfor in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present rushing arially along shocking unlighted and fearhaunted abysses and occasionallytearingthrough certain wellmarked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous uncouth clouds or vapours in these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together when we were together my friend was always far ahead i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me golden from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty its anomalously youthful cheeks its burning eyes its olympian brow and its shadowing hair and growth of beardof the progress of time we kept no record for time had become to us the merest illusion i know only that there must have been something very singular involved since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old our discourse was unholy and always hideously ambitiousno god or daemon could have aspired to discoveries and conquests like those which we planned in whispers i shiver as i speak of them and dare not be explicit though i will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky i will hintonly hintthat he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command and the destinies of all living things be his i affirmi swearthat i had no share in these extreme aspirations anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be erroneous for i am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable warfare in unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve successthere was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known my friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether and i could see the sinister exultation on his floating luminous too youthful memoryface suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared and in a brief space i found myself projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate it was like the others yet incalculably denser a sticky clammy mass if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a nonmaterial spherei had i felt been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed struggling anew i came to the end of the drugdream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellowdreamer weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed goldgreen light on his marble features then after a short interval the form in the corner stirred and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me i cannot tell you how he shrieked or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright i can only say that i fainted and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his phrensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolationthat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream awed shaken and portentous my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again what he had seen he dared not tell me but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake that he was right i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed after each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking it is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before ones eyes our mode of life was now totally altered heretofore a recluse so far as i knowhis true name and origin never having passed his lipsmy friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude at night he would not be alone nor would the company of a few persons calm him his sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown to us our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which i keenly resented but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein he did not always glance at the same place in the skyit seemed to be a different place at different times on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast in the summer it would be nearly overhead in the autumn it would be in the northwest in winter it would be in the east but mostly if in the small hours of morning midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him only after two years did i connect this fear with anything in particular but then i began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glancea spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealiswe now had a studio in london never separating but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world we were aged and weak from our drugs dissipations and nervous overstrain and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snowwhite our freedom from long sleep was surprising for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace then came one january of fog and rain when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy my statues and ivory heads were all sold and i had no means to purchase new materials or energy to fashion them even had i possessed them we suffered terribly and on a certain night my friend sank into a deepbreathing sleep from which i could not awaken him i can recall the scene nowthe desolate pitchblack garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down the ticking of the lone clock the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressingtable the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space and worst of all the deep steady sinister breathing of my friend on the coucha rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden unimagined and hideously remotethe tension of my vigil became oppressive and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind i heard a clock strike somewherenot ours for that was not a striking clockand my morbid fancy found in this a new startingpoint for idle wanderings clockstimespaceinfinityand then my fancy reverted to the local as i reflected that even now beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere corona borealis was rising in the northeast corona borealis which my friend had appeared to dread and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether all at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drugmagnified soundsa low and damnably insistent whine from very far away droning clamouring mocking callingfrom the northeastbut it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door it was not what iheardbut what isawfor in that dark locked shuttered and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible redgold lighta shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memoryface as i had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmareand as i looked i beheld the head rise the black liquid and deepsunken eyes open in terror and the thin shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered there dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face as it shone bodiless luminous and rejuvenated in the blackness more of stark teeming brainshattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me no word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer but as i followed the memoryfaces mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source the source whence also the whining came i too saw for an instant what it saw and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking and epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police never could i tell try as i might what it actually was that i saw nor could the still face tell for although it must have seen more than i did it will never speak again but always i shall guard against the mocking and insatiate hypnos lord of sleep against the night sky and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophyjust what happened is unknown for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness they have said i know not for what reason that i never had a friend but that art philosophy and insanity had filled all my tragic life the lodgers and police on that night soothed me and the doctor administered something to quiet me nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place my stricken friend moved them to no pity but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours bald greybearded shrivelled palsied drugcrazed and broken adoring and praying to the object they foundfor they deny that i sold the last of my statuary and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold petrified and unvocal it is all that remains of my friend the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage a godlike head of such marble as only old hellas could yield young with the youth that is outside time and with beauteous bearded face curved smiling lips olympian brow and dense locks waving and poppycrowned they say that that haunting memoryface is modelled from my own as it was at twentyfive but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of attica,1
as ibid says in his famouslives of the poetsfrom a student themethe erroneous idea that ibid is the author of thelivesis so frequently met with even among those pretending to a degree of culture that it is worth correcting it should be a matter of general knowledge that cf is responsible for this work ibids masterpiece on the other hand was the famousop citwherein all the significant undercurrents of graecoroman expression were crystallised once for alland with admirable acuteness notwithstanding the surprisingly late date at which ibid wrote there is a false reportvery commonly reproduced in modern books prior to von schweinkopfs monumentalgeschichte der ostrogothen in italienthat ibid was a romanised visigoth of ataulfs horde who settled in placentia about 410 ad the contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised for von schweinkopf and since his time littlewit1and btenoir2have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine romanor at least as genuine a roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produceof whom one might well say what gibbon said of boethius that he was the last whom cato or tully could have acknowledged for their countryman he was like boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age of the great anician family and traced his genealogy with much exactitude and selfsatisfaction to all the heroes of the republic his full namelong and pompous according to the custom of an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic roman nomenclatureis stated by von schweinkopf3to have been caius anicius magnus furius camillus milianus cornelius valerius pompeius julius ibidus though littlewit4rejectsmilianusand addsclaudius decius junianuswhilst btenoir5differs radically giving the full name as magnus furius camillus aurelius antoninus flavius anicius petronius valentinianus aegidus ibidusthe eminent critic and biographer was born in the year 486 shortly after the extinction of the roman rule in gaul by clovis rome and ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of athensthe extent of whose suppression by theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial in 512 under the benign rule of the ostrogoth theodoric we behold him as a teacher of rhetoric at rome and in 516 he held the consulship together with pompilius numantius bombastes marcellinus deodamnatus upon the death of theodoric in 526 ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work whose pure ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of claudius claudianus who flourished a century before ibidus but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court rhetorician for theodatus nephew of theodoricupon the usurpation of vitiges ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time imprisoned but the coming of the byzantineroman army under belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours throughout the siege of rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders and afterward followed the eagles of belisarius to alba porto and centumcellae after the frankish siege of milan ibidus was chosen to accompany the learned bishop datius to greece and resided with him at corinth in the year 539 about 541 he removed to constantinopolis where he received every mark of imperial favour both from justinianus and justinus the second the emperors tiberius and maurice did kindly honour to his old age and contributed much to his immortalityespecially maurice whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old rome notwithstanding his birth at arabiscus in cappadocia it was maurice who in the poets 101st year secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the schools of the empire an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged rhetoricians emotions since he passed away peacefully at his home near the church of st sophia on the sixth day before the kalends of september ad 587 in the 102nd year of his agehis remains notwithstanding the troubled state of italy were taken to ravenna for interment but being interred in the suburb of classe were exhumed and ridiculed by the lombard duke of spoleto who took his skull to king autharis for use as a wassailbowl ibids skull was proudly handed down from king to king of the lombard line upon the capture of pavia by charlemagne in 774 the skull was seized from the tottering desiderius and carried in the train of the frankish conqueror it was from this vessel indeed that pope leo administered the royal unction which made of the heronomad a holy roman emperor charlemagne took ibids skull to his capital at aix soon afterward presenting it to his saxon teacher alcuin upon whose death in 804 it was sent to alcuins kinsfolk in englandwilliam the conqueror finding it in an abbey niche where the pious family of alcuin had placed it believing it to be the skull of a saint6who had miraculously annihilated the lombards by his prayers did reverence to its osseous antiquity and even the rough soldiers of cromwell upon destroying ballylough abbey in ireland in 1650 it having been secretly transported thither by a devout papist in 1539 upon henry viiis dissolution of the english monasteries declined to offer violence to a relic so venerableit was captured by the private soldier reademandweep hopkins who not long after traded it to restinjehovah stubbs for a quid of new virginia weed stubbs upon sending forth his son zerubbabel to seek his fortune in new england in 1661 for he thought ill of the restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman gave him st ibidsor rather brother ibids for he abhorred all that was popishskull as a talisman upon landing in salem zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney he having built a modest house near the town pump however he had not been wholly unaffected by the restoration influence and having become addicted to gaming lost the skull to one epenetus dexter a visiting freeman of providenceit was in the house of dexter in the northern part of the town near the present intersection of north main and olney streets on the occasion of canonchets raid of march 30 1676 during king philips war and the astute sachem recognising it at once as a thing of singular venerableness and dignity sent it as a symbol of alliance to a faction of the pequots in connecticut with whom he was negotiating on april 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed but the austere head of ibid continued on its wanderingsthe pequots enfeebled by a previous war could give the now stricken narragansetts no assistance and in 1680 a dutch furtrader of albany petrus van schaack secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders he having recognised its value from the halfeffaced inscription carved in lombardic minuscules palaeography it might be explained was one of the leading accomplishments of newnetherland furtraders of the seventeenth centuryfrom van schaack sad to say the relic was stolen in 1683 by a french trader jean grenier whose popish zeal recognised the features of one whom he had been taught at his mothers knee to revere as st ibide grenier fired with virtuous rage at the possession of this holy symbol by a protestant crushed van schaacks head one night with an axe and escaped to the north with his booty soon however being robbed and slain by the halfbreed voyageur michel savard who took the skulldespite the illiteracy which prevented his recognising itto add to a collection of similar but more recent materialupon his death in 1701 his halfbreed son pierre traded it among other things to some emissaries of the sacs and foxes and it was found outside the chiefs tepee a generation later by charles de langlade founder of the trading post at green bay wisconsin de langlade regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at the expense of many glass beads yet after his time it found itself in many other hands being traded to settlements at the head of lake winnebago to tribes around lake mendota and finally early in the nineteenth century to one solomon juneau a frenchman at the new trading post of milwaukee on the menominee river and the shore of lake michiganlater traded to jacques caboche another settler it was in 1850 lost in a game of chess or poker to a newcomer named hans zimmerman being used by him as a beerstein until one day under the spell of its contents he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie path before

dedicated to c w smithfrom whose suggestion the central situation is takenthere is nothing more absurd as i view it than that conventional association of the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the psychology of the multitude mention a bucolic yankee setting a bungling and thickfibred village undertaker and a careless mishap in a tomb and no average reader can be brought to expect more than a hearty albeit grotesque phase of comedy god knows though that the prosy tale which george birchs death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are lightbirch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881 yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it neither did his old physician dr davis who died years ago it was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of peck valley cemetery escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means but while this much was undoubtedly true there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last he confided in me because i was his doctor and because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after davis died he was a bachelor wholly without relativesbirch before 1881 had been the village undertaker of peck valley and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go the practices i heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today at least in a city and even peck valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly layingout apparel invisible beneath the caskets lid and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy most distinctly birch was lax insensitive and professionally undesirable yet i still think he was not an evil man he was merely crass of fibre and functionthoughtless careless and liquorish as his easily avoidable accident proves and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by tastejust where to begin birchs story i can hardly decide since i am no practiced teller of tales i suppose one should start in the cold december of 1880 when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring fortunately the village was small and the death rate low so that it was possible to give all of birchs inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated receiving tomb the undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter weather and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness never did he knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets or disregard more flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandonat last the spring thaw came and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb birch though dreading the bother of removal and interment began his task of transference one disagreeable april morning but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse after having laid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest that was darius peck the nonagenarian whose grave was not far from the tomb birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old matthew fenner whose grave was also near by but actually postponed the matter for three days not getting to work till good friday the 15th being without superstition he did not heed the day at all though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week certainly the events of that evening greatly changed george birchon the afternoon of friday april 15th then birch set out for the tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of matthew fenner that he was not perfectly sober he subsequently admitted though he had not then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget certain things he was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head much as on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it the day was clear but a high wind had sprung up and birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and entered the sidehill vault another might not have relished the damp odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins but birch in those days was insensitive and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right grave he had not forgotten the criticism aroused when hannah bixbys relatives wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they had moved found the casket of judge capwell beneath her headstonethe light was dim but birchs sight was good and he did not get asaph sawyers coffin by mistake although it was very similar he had indeed made that coffin for matthew fenner but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and flimsy in a fit of curious sentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had been to him during his bankruptcy five years before he gave old matt the very best his skill could produce but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen and to use it when asaph sawyer died of a malignant fever sawyer was not a lovable man and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied to him birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the fenner casketit was just as he had recognised old matts coffin that the door slammed to in the wind leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before the narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch in this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles pushed at the iron panels and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant in this twilight too he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply for the longneglected latch was obviously broken leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault a victim of his own oversightthe thing must have happened at about threethirty in the afternoon birch being by temperament phlegmatic and practical did not shout long but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb it is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly his days work was sadly interrupted and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither he might have to remain all night or longer the pile of tools soon reached and a hammer and chisel selected birch returned over the coffins to the door the air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled half by feeling at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch he would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle but lacking these bungled semisightlessly as best he mightwhen he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these birch glanced about for other possible points of escape the vault had been dug from a hillside so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth making this direction utterly useless to consider over the door however the high slitlike transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb and the coffin niches on the sides and rearwhich birch seldom took the trouble to useafforded no ascent to the space above the door only the coffins themselves remained as potential steppingstones and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of arranging them three coffinheights he reckoned would permit him to reach the transom but he could do better with four the boxes were fairly even and could be piled up like blocks so he began to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep as he planned he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty is strongly to be doubtedfinally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall to place upon this two layers of two each and upon these a single box to serve as the platform this arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness and would furnish the desired height better still though he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course several of the coffins began to split under the stress of handling and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of little matthew fenner for the top in order that his feet might have as certain a surface as possible in the semigloom he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one and indeed came upon it almost by accident since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layerthe tower at length finished and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom the borders of the space were entirely of brick and there seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body to pass as his hammer blows began to fall the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and may have been mocking in either case it would have been appropriate for the unexpected tenacity of the easylooking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulusdusk fell and found birch still toiling he worked largely by feeling now since newly gathered clouds hid the moon and though progress was still slow he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture he could he was sure get out by midnightthough it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time the place and the company beneath his feet he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork cursing when a fragment hit him in the face and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree in time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked he would not he found have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permitit must have been midnight at least when birch decided he could get through the transom tired and perspiring despite many rests he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside the hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily and he vaguely wished it would stop he was curiously unelated over his impending escape and almost dreaded the exertion for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age as he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly especially when upon reaching the topmost one he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood he had it seems planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine maddened by the sound or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh and plunged madly off through the night the wagon rattling crazily behind itbirch in his ghastly situation was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom but gathered his energies for a determined try clutching the edges of the aperture he sought to pull himself up when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles in another moment he knew fear for the first time that night for struggle as he would he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity horrible pains as of savage wounds shot through his calves and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters loose nails or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box perhaps he screamed at any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a halfswooninstinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground he could not walk it appeared and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare there was evidently however no pursuer for he was alone and alive when armington the lodgekeeper answered his feeble clawing at the doorarmington helped birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son edwin for dr davis the afflicted man was fully conscious but would say nothing of any consequence merely muttering such things as oh my ankles let go or shut in the tomb then the doctor came with his medicinecase and asked crisp questions and removed the patients outer clothing shoes and socks the woundsfor both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the achilles tendonsseemed to puzzle the old physician greatly and finally almost to frighten him his questioning grew more than medically tense and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possiblefor an impersonal doctor davis ominous and awestruck crossexamination became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience he was oddly anxious to know if birch were sureabsolutely sureof the identity of that top coffin of the pile how he had chosen it how he had been certain of it as the fenner coffin in the dusk and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious asaph sawyer would the firm fenner casket have caved in so readily davis an oldtime village practitioner had of course seen both at the respective funerals as indeed he had attended both fenner and sawyer in their last illnesses he had even wondered at sawyers funeral how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive fennerafter a full two hours dr davis left urging birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood what else he added could ever in any case be proved or believed but it would be well to say as little as could be said and to let no other doctor treat the wounds birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story and when i saw the scarsancient and whitened as they then werei agreed that he was wise in so doing he always remained lame for the great tendons had been severed but i think the greatest lameness was in his soul his thinking processes once so phlegmatic and logical had become ineffaceably scarred and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as friday tomb coffin and words of less obvious concatenation his frightened horse had gone home but his frightened wits never quite did that he changed his business but something always preyed upon him it may have been just fear and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities his drinking of course only aggravated what it was meant to alleviatewhen dr davis left birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb the moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms the doctor entered and looked about stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced he cried aloud once and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriolit was asaphs coffin birch just as i thought i knew his teeth with the front ones missing on the upper jawnever for gods sake shew those wounds the body was pretty badly gone but if ever i saw vindictiveness on any faceor former face you know what a fiend he was for revengehow he ruined old raymond thirty years after their boundary suit and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last august he was the devil incarnate birch and i believe his eyeforaneye fury could beat old father death himself god what a rage id hate to have it aimed at mewhy did you do it birch he was a scoundrel and i dont blame you for giving him a castaside coffin but you always did go too damned far well enough to skimp on the thing some way but you knew what a little man old fenner wasill never get the picture out of my head as long as i live you kicked hard for asaphs coffin was on the floor his head was broken in and everything was tumbled about ive seen sights before but there was one thing too much here an eye for an eye great heavens birch but you got what you deserved the skull turned my stomach but the other was worsethose ankles cut neatly off to fit matt fenners castaside

before i try to rest i will set down these notes in preparation for the report i must make what i have found is so singular and so contrary to all past experience and expectations that it deserves a very careful descriptioni reached the main landing on venus march 18 terrestrial time vi 9 of the planets calendar being put in the main group under miller i received my equipmentwatch tuned to venuss slightly quicker rotationand went through the usual mask drill after two days i was pronounced fit for dutyleaving the crystal companys post at terra nova around dawn vi 12 i followed the southerly route which anderson had mapped out from the air the going was bad for these jungles are always half impassable after a rain it must be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and creepers that leathery toughness a toughness so great that a knife has to work ten minutes on some of them by noon it was dryerthe vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that the knife went through it easilybut even then i could not make much speed these carter oxygen masks are too heavyjust carrying one half wears an ordinary man out a dubois mask with spongereservoir instead of tubes would give just as good air at half the weightthe crystaldetector seemed to function well pointing steadily in a direction verifying andersons report it is curious how that principle of affinity workswithout any of the fakery of the old divining rods back home there must be a great deposit of crystals within a thousand miles though i suppose those damnable manlizards always watch and guard it possibly they think we are just as foolish for coming to venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for grovelling in the mud whenever they see a piece of it or for keeping that great mass on a pedestal in their temple i wish theyd get a new religion for they have no use for the crystals except to pray to barring theology they would let us take all we wantand even if they learned to tap them for power thered be more than enough for their planet and the earth besides i for one am tired of passing up the main deposits and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle riverbeds sometime ill urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff army from home about twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn the trick one cant call the damned things men for all their cities and towers they havent any skill except buildingand using swords and poison dartsand i dont believe their socalled cities mean much more than anthills or beaverdams i doubt if they even have a real languageall the talk about psychological communication through those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk what misleads people is their upright posture just an accidental physical resemblance to terrestrial manid like to go through a venus jungle for once without having to watch out for skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts they may have been all right before we began to take the crystals but theyre certainly a bad enough nuisance nowwith their dartshooting and their cutting of our water pipes more and more i come to believe that they have a special sense like our crystaldetectors no one ever knew them to bother a manapart from longdistance snipingwho didnt have crystals on himaround 1 pm a dart nearly took my helmet off and i thought for a second one of my oxygen tubes was punctured the sly devils hadnt made a sound but three of them were closing in on me i got them all by sweeping in a circle with my flame pistol for even though their colour blended with the jungle i could spot the moving creepers one of them was fully eight feet tall with a snout like a tapirs the other two were average sevenfooters all that makes them hold their own is sheer numberseven a single regiment of flame throwers could raise hell with them it is curious though how theyve come to be dominant on the planet not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans and skorahs or the flying tukahs of the other continentunless of course those holes in the dionaean plateau hide somethingabout two oclock my detector veered westward indicating isolated crystals ahead on the right this checked up with anderson and i turned my course accordingly it was harder goingnot only because the ground was rising but because the animal life and carnivorous plants were thicker i was always slashing ugrats and stepping on skorahs and my leather suit was all speckled from the bursting darohs which struck it from all sides the sunlight was all the worse because of the mist and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least every time i stepped my feet sank down five or six inches and there was a sucking sort ofblupevery time i pulled them out i wish somebody would invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this climate cloth of course would rot but some thin metallic tissue that couldnt tearlike the surface of this revolving decayproof record scrollought to be feasible some timei ate about 330if slipping these wretched food tablets through my mask can be called eating soon after that i noticed a decided change in the landscapethe bright poisonouslooking flowers shifting in colour and getting wraithlike the outlines of everything shimmered rhythmically and bright points of light appeared and danced in the same slow steady tempo after that the temperature seemed to fluctuate in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drummingthe whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep regular pulsations that filled every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind alike i lost all sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily nor did it change things in the least when i shut my eyes and covered my ears with my hands however my mind was still clear and in a very few minutes i realised what had happenedi had encountered at last one of those curious mirageplants about which so many of our men told stories anderson had warned me of them and described their appearance very closelythe shaggy stalk the spiky leaves and the mottled blossoms whose gaseous dreambreeding exhalations penetrate every existing make of maskrecalling what happened to bailey three years ago i fell into a momentary panic and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy chaotic world which the plants exhalations had woven around me then good sense came back and i realised all i need do was retreat from the dangerous blossoms heading away from the source of the pulsations and cutting a path blindlyregardless of what might seem to swirl around meuntil safely out of the plants effective radiusalthough everything was spinning perilously i tried to start in the right direction and hack my way ahead my route must have been far from straight for it seemed hours before i was free of the mirageplants pervasive influence gradually the dancing lights began to disappear and the shimmering spectral scenery began to assume the aspect of solidity when i did get wholly clear i looked at my watch and was astonished to find that the time was only 420 though eternities had seemed to pass the whole experience could have consumed little more than a halfhourevery delay however was irksome and i had lost ground in my retreat from the plant i now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by the crystaldetector bending every energy toward making better time the jungle was still thick though there was less animal life once a carnivorous blossom engulfed my right foot and held it so tightly that i had to hack it free with my knife reducing the flower to strips before it let goin less than an hour i saw that the jungle growths were thinning out and by five oclockafter passing through a belt of treeferns with very little underbrushi emerged on a broad mossy plateau my progress now became rapid and i saw by the wavering of my detectorneedle that i was getting relatively close to the crystal i sought this was odd for most of the scattered egglike spheroids occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this treeless uplandthe terrain sloped upward ending in a definite crest i reached the top about 530 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests in the distance this without question was the plateau mapped by matsugawa from the air fifty years ago and called on our maps eryx or the erycinian highland but what made my heart leap was a smaller detail whose position could not have been far from the plains exact centre it was a single point of light blazing through the mist and seeming to draw a piercing concentrated luminescence from the yellowish vapourdulled sunbeams this without doubt was the crystal i soughta thing possibly no larger than a hens egg yet containing enough power to keep a city warm for a year i could hardly wonder as i glimpsed the distant glow that those miserable manlizards worship such crystals and yet they have not the least notion of the powers they containbreaking into a rapid run i tried to reach the unexpected prize as soon as possible and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a thin singularly detestable mud studded with occasional patches of weeds and creepers but i splashed on heedlesslyscarcely thinking to look around for any of the skulking manlizards in this open space i was not very likely to be waylaid as i advanced the light ahead seemed to grow in size and brilliancy and i began to notice some peculiarity in its situation clearly this was a crystal of the very finest quality and my elation grew with every spattering stepit is now that i must begin to be careful in making my report since what i shall henceforward have to say involves unprecedentedthough fortunately verifiablematters i was racing ahead with mounting eagerness and had come within an hundred yards or so of the crystalwhose position on a sort of raised place in the omnipresent slime seemed very oddwhen a sudden overpowering force struck my chest and the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward into the mud the splash of my fall was terrific nor did the softness of the ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head from a bewildering jarring for a moment i lay supine too utterly startled to think then i halfmechanically stumbled to my feet and began to scrape the worst of the mud and scum from my leather suitof what i had encountered i could not form the faintest idea i had seen nothing which could have caused the shock and i saw nothing now had i after all merely slipped in the mud my sore knuckles and aching chest forbade me to think so or was this whole incident an illusion brought on by some hidden mirageplant it hardly seemed probable since i had none of the usual symptoms and since there was no place near by where so vivid and typical a growth could lurk unseen had i been on the earth i would have suspected a barrier of nforce laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone but in this humanless region such a notion would have been absurdfinally pulling myself together i decided to investigate in a cautious way holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me so that it might be first to feel the strange force i started once more for the shining crystalpreparing to advance step by step with the greatest deliberation at the third step i was brought up short by the impact of the knifepoint on an apparently solid surfacea solid surface where my eyes saw nothingafter a moments recoil i gained boldness extending my gloved left hand i verified the presence of invisible solid matteror a tactile illusion of solid matterahead of me upon moving my hand i found that the barrier was of substantial extent and of an almost glassy smoothness with no evidence of the joining of separate blocks nerving myself for further experiments i removed a glove and tested the thing with my bare hand it was indeed hard and glassy and of a curious coldness as contrasted with the air around i strained my eyesight to the utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing substance but could discern nothing whatsoever there was not even any evidence of refractive power as judged by the aspect of the landscape ahead absence of reflective power was proved by the lack of a glowing image of the sun at any pointburning curiosity began to displace all other feelings and i enlarged my investigations as best i could exploring with my hands i found that the barrier extended from the ground to some level higher than i could reach and that it stretched off indefinitely on both sides it was then a wall of some kindthough all guesses as to its materials and its purpose were beyond me again i thought of the mirageplant and the dreams it induced but a moments reasoning put this out of my headknocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife and kicking at it with my heavy boots i tried to interpret the sounds thus made there was something suggestive of cement or concrete in these reverberations though my hands had found the surface more glassy or metallic in feel certainly i was confronting something strange beyond all previous experiencethe next logical move was to get some idea of the walls dimensions the height problem would be hard if not insoluble but the length and shape problem could perhaps be sooner dealt with stretching out my arms and pressing close to the barrier i began to edge gradually to the leftkeeping very careful track of the way i faced after several steps i concluded that the wall was not straight but that i was following part of some vast circle or ellipse and then my attention was distracted by something wholly differentsomething connected with the stilldistant crystal which had formed the object of my questi have said that even from a greater distance the shining objects position seemed indefinably queeron a slight mound rising from the slime nowat about an hundred yardsi could see plainly despite the engulfing mist just what that mound was it was the body of a man in one of the crystal companys leather suits lying on his back and with his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few inches away in his right hand crushed convulsively against his chest was the crystal which had led me herea spheroid of incredible size so large that the dead fingers could scarcely close over it even at the given distance i could see that the body was a recent one there was little visible decay and i reflected that in this climate such a thing meant death not more than a day before soon the hateful farnothflies would begin to cluster about the corpse i wondered who the man was surely no one i had seen on this trip it must have been one of the oldtimers absent on a long roving commission who had come to this especial region independently of andersons survey there he lay past all trouble and with the rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his stiffened fingersfor fully five minutes i stood there staring in bewilderment and apprehension a curious dread assailed me and i had an unreasonable impulse to run away it could not have been done by those slinking manlizards for he still held the crystal he had found was there any connexion with the invisible wall where had he found the crystal andersons instrument had indicated one in this quarter well before this man could have perished i now began to regard the unseen barrier as something sinister and recoiled from it with a shudder yet i knew i must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of this recent tragedysuddenlywrenching my mind back to the problem i facedi thought of a possible means of testing the walls height or at least of finding whether or not it extended indefinitely upward seizing a handful of mud i let it drain until it gained some coherence and then flung it high in the air toward the utterly transparent barrier at a height of perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible surface with a resounding splash disintegrating at once and oozing downward in disappearing streams with surprising rapidity plainly the wall was a lofty one a second handful hurled at an even sharper angle hit the surface about eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the firsti now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful as high as i possibly could letting the mud drain and squeezing it to maximum dryness i flung it up so steeply that i feared it might not reach the obstructing surface at all it did however and this time it crossed the barrier and fell in the mud beyond with a violent spattering at last i had a rough idea of the height of the wall for the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or 21 feet aloftwith a nineteen or twentyfoot vertical wall of glassy flatness ascent was clearly impossible i must then continue to circle the barrier in the hope of finding a gate an ending or some sort of interruption did the obstacle form a complete round or other closed figure or was it merely an arc or semicircle acting on my decision i resumed my slow leftward circling moving my hands up and down over the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or other small aperture before starting i tried to mark my position by kicking a hole in the mud but found the slime too thin to hold any impression i did though gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in the distant forest which seemed just on a line with the gleaming crystal an hundred yards away if no gate or break existed i could now tell when i had completely circumnavigated the walli had not progressed far before i decided that the curvature indicated a circular enclosure of about an hundred yards diameterprovided the outline was regular this would mean that the dead man lay near the wall at a point almost opposite the region where i had started was he just inside or just outside the enclosure this i would soon ascertainas i slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate window or other break i decided that the body was lying within on closer view the features of the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing i found something alarming in his expression and in the way the glassy eyes stared by the time i was very near i believed i recognised him as dwight a veteran whom i had never known but who was pointed out to me at the post last year the crystal he clutched was certainly a prizethe largest single specimen i had ever seeni was so near the body that i couldbut for the barrierhave touched it when my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the unseen surface in a second i had learned that there was an opening about three feet wide extending from the ground to a height greater than i could reach there was no door nor any evidence of hingemarks bespeaking a former door without a moments hesitation i stepped through and advanced two paces to the prostrate bodywhich lay at right angles to the hallway i had entered in what seemed to be an intersecting doorless corridor it gave me a fresh curiosity to find that the interior of this vast enclosure was divided by partitionsbending to examine the corpse i discovered that it bore no wounds this scarcely surprised me since the continued presence of the crystal argued against the pseudoreptilian natives looking about for some possible cause of death my eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close to the bodys feet here indeed was something significant without this device no human being could breathe the air of venus for more than thirty seconds and dwightif it were hehad obviously lost his probably it had been carelessly buckled so that the weight of the tubes worked the straps loosea thing which could not happen with a dubois spongereservoir mask the halfminute of grace had been too short to allow the man to stoop and recover his protectionor else the cyanogen content of the atmosphere was abnormally high at the time probably he had been busy admiring the crystalwherever he may have found it he had apparently just taken it from the pouch in his suit for the flap was unbuttonedi now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead prospectors fingersa task which the bodys stiffness made very difficult the spheroid was larger than a mans fist and glowed as if alive in the reddish rays of the westering sun as i touched the gleaming surface i shuddered involuntarilyas if by taking this precious object i had transferred to myself the doom which had overtaken its earlier bearer however my qualms soon passed and i carefully buttoned the crystal into the pouch of my leather suit superstition has never been one of my failingsplacing the mans helmet over his dead staring face i straightened up and stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the great enclosure all my curiosity about the strange edifice now returned and i racked my brain with speculations regarding its material origin and purpose that the hands of men had reared it i could not for a moment believe our ships first reached venus only 72 years ago and the only human beings on the planet have been those at terra nova nor does human knowledge include any perfectly transparent nonrefractive solid such as the substance of this building prehistoric human invasions of venus can be pretty well ruled out so that one must turn to the idea of native construction did a forgotten race of highly evolved beings precede the manlizards as masters of venus despite their elaborately built cities it seemed hard to credit the pseudoreptiles with anything of this kind there must have been another race aeons ago of which this is perhaps the last relique or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by future expeditions thepurposeof such a structure passes all conjecturebut its strange and seemingly nonpractical material suggests a religious userealising my inability to solve these problems i decided that all i could do was to explore the invisible structure itself that various rooms and corridors extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud i felt convinced and i believed that a knowledge of their plan might lead to something significant so feeling my way back through the doorway and edging past the body i began to advance along the corridor toward those interior regions whence the dead man had presumably come later on i would investigate the hallway i had leftgroping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight i moved slowly onward soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward the centre in everdiminishing curves now and then my touch would reveal a doorless intersecting passage and i several times encountered junctions with two three or four diverging avenues in these latter cases i always followed the inmost route which seemed to form a continuation of the one i had been traversing there would be plenty of time to examine the branches after i had reached and returned from the main regions i can scarcely describe the strangeness of the experiencethreading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by forgotten hands on an alien planetat last still stumbling and groping i felt the corridor end in a sizeable open space fumbling about i found i was in a circular chamber about ten feet across and from the position of the dead man against certain distant forest landmarks i judged that this chamber lay at or near the centre of the edifice out of it opened five corridors besides the one through which i had entered but i kept the latter in mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on the horizon as i stood just within the entrancethere was nothing in this room to distinguish itmerely the floor of thin mud which was everywhere present wondering whether this part of the building had any roof i repeated my experiment with an upwardflung handful of mud and found at once that no covering existed if there had ever been one it must have fallen long ago for not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet as i reflected it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently primordial structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry gaps in the walls and other common attributes of dilapidationwhat was it what had it ever been of what was it made why was there no evidence of separate blocks in the glassy bafflingly homogeneous walls why were there no traces of doors either interior or exterior i knew only that i was in a round roofless doorless edifice of some hard smooth perfectly transparent nonrefractive and nonreflective material an hundred yards in diameter with many corridors and with a small circular room at the centre more than this i could never learn from a direct investigationi now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the westa goldenruddy disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the mistclouded trees of the horizon plainly i would have to hurry if i expected to choose a sleepingspot on dry ground before dark i had long before decided to camp for the night on the firm mossy rim of the plateau near the crest whence i had first spied the shining crystal trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the manlizards it has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of two or more so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours but the really small number of night attacks makes the company careless about such things those scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in seeing at night even with curious glowtorcheshaving picked out again the hallway through which i had come i started to return to the structures entrance additional exploration could wait for another day groping a course as best i could through the spiral corridorwith only general sense memory and a vague recognition of some of the illdefined weed patches on the plain as guidesi soon found myself once more in close proximity to the corpse there were now one or two farnothflies swooping over the helmetcovered face and i knew that decay was setting in with a futile instinctive loathing i raised my hand to brush away this vanguard of the scavengerswhen a strange and astonishing thing became manifest an invisible wall checking the sweep of my arm told me thatnotwithstanding my careful retracing of the wayi had not indeed returned to the corridor in which the body lay instead i was in a parallel hallway having no doubt taken some wrong turn or fork among the intricate passages behindhoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead i continued my advance but presently came to a blank wall i would then have to return to the central chamber and steer my course anew exactly where i had made my mistake i could not tell i glanced at the ground to see if by any miracle guiding footprints had remained but at once realised that the thin mud held impressions only for a very few moments there was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre again and once there i carefully reflected on the proper outward course i had kept too far to the right before this time i must take a more leftward fork somewherejust where i could decide as i wentas i groped ahead a second time i felt quite confident of my correctness and diverged to the left at a junction i was sure i remembered the spiralling continued and i was careful not to stray into any intersecting passages soon however i saw to my disgust that i was passing the body at a considerable distance this passage evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it in the hope that another exit might exist in the half of the wall i had not yet explored i pressed forward for several paces but eventually came once more to a solid barrier clearly the plan of the building was even more complicated than i had thoughti now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try some of the lateral corridors extending toward the body if i chose this second alternative i would run the risk of breaking my mental pattern of where i was hence i had better not attempt it unless i could think of some way of leaving a visible trail behind me just how to leave a trail would be quite a problem and i ransacked my mind for a solution there seemed to be nothing about my person which could leave a mark on anything nor any material which i could scatteror minutely subdivide and scattermy pen had no effect on the invisible wall and i could not lay a trail of my precious food tablets even had i been willing to spare the latter there would not have been even nearly enoughbesides which the small pellets would have instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud i searched my pockets for an oldfashioned notebookoften used unofficially on venus despite the quick rottingrate of paper in the planets atmospherewhose pages i could tear up and scatter but could find none it was obviously impossible to tear the tough thin metal of this revolving decayproof record scroll nor did my clothing offer any possibilities in venuss peculiar atmosphere i could not safely spare my stout leather suit and underwear had been eliminated because of the climatei tried to smear mud on the smooth invisible walls after squeezing it as dry as possible but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as did the heighttesting handfuls i had previously thrown finally i drew out my knife and attempted to scratch a line on the glassy phantom surfacesomething i could recognise with my hand even though i would not have the advantage of seeing it from afar it was useless however for the blade made not the slightest impression on the baffling unknown materialfrustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail i again sought the round central chamber through memory it seemed easier to get back to this room than to steer a definite predetermined course away from it and i had little difficulty in finding it anew this time i listed on my record scroll every turn i madedrawing a crude hypothetical diagram of my route and marking all diverging corridors it was of course maddeningly slow work when everything had to be determined by touch and the possibilities of error were infinite but i believed it would pay in the long runthe long twilight of venus was thick when i reached the central room but i still had hopes of gaining the outside before dark comparing my fresh diagram with previous recollections i believed i had located my original mistake so once more set out confidently along the invisible hallways i veered further to the left than during my previous attempts and tried to keep track of my turnings on the record scroll in case i was still mistaken in the gathering dusk i could see the dim line of the corpse now the centre of a loathsome cloud of farnothflies before long no doubt the muddwelling sificlighs would be oozing in from the plain to complete the ghastly work approaching the body with some reluctance i was preparing to step past it when a sudden collision with a wall told me i was again astrayi now realised plainly that i was lost the complications of this building were too much for offhand solution and i would probably have to do some careful checking before i could hope to emerge still i was eager to get to dry ground before total darkness set in hence i returned once more to the centre and began a rather aimless series of trials and errorsmaking notes by the light of my electric lamp when i used this device i noticed with interest that it produced no reflectionnot even the faintest glisteningin the transparent walls around me i was however prepared for this since the sun had at no time formed a gleaming image in the strange materiali was still groping about when the dusk became total a heavy mist obscured most of the stars and planets but the earth was plainly visible as a glowing bluishgreen point in the southeast it was just past opposition and would have been a glorious sight in a telescope i could even make out the moon beside it whenever the vapours momentarily thinned it was now impossible to see the corpsemy only landmarkso i blundered back to the central chamber after a few false turns after all i would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry ground nothing could be done till daylight and i might as well make the best of it here lying down in the mud would not be pleasant but in my leather suit it could be done on former expeditions i had slept under even worse conditions and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer repugnanceso here i am squatting in the slime of the central room and making these notes on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp there is something almost humorous in my strange unprecedented plight lost in a building without doorsa building which i cannot see i shall doubtless get out early in the morning and ought to be back at terra nova with the crystal by late afternoon it certainly is a beautywith surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp i have just had it out examining it despite my fatigue sleep is slow in coming so i find myself writing at great length i must stop now not much danger of being bothered by those cursed natives in this place the thing i like least is the corpsebut fortunately my oxygen mask saves me from the worst effects i am using the chlorate cubes very sparingly will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in more laterlaterafternoon vi 13there has been more trouble than i expected i am still in the building and will have to work quickly and wisely if i expect to rest on dry ground tonight it took me a long time to get to sleep and i did not wake till almost noon today as it was i would have slept longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze the corpse was a rather bad sightwriggling with sificlighs and with a cloud of farnothflies around it something had pushed the helmet away from the face and it was better not to look at it i was doubly glad of my oxygen mask when i thought of the situationat length i shook and brushed myself dry took a couple of food tablets and put a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of the mask i am using these cubes slowly but wish i had a larger supply i felt much better after my sleep and expected to get out of the building very shortlyconsulting the notes and sketches i had jotted down i was impressed by the complexity of the hallways and by the possibility that i had made a fundamental error of the six openings leading out of the central space i had chosen a certain one as that by which i had enteredusing a sightingarrangement as a guide when i stood just within the opening the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in line with a particular lepidodendron in the faroff forest now it occurred to me that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracythe distance of the corpse making its difference of direction in relation to the horizon comparatively slight when viewed from the openings next to that of my first ingress moreover the tree did not differ as distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the horizonputting the matter to a test i found to my chagrin that i could not be sure which of three openings was the right one had i traversed a different set of windings at each attempted exit this time i would be sure it struck me that despite the impossibility of trailblazing there was one marker i could leave though i could not spare my suit i couldbecause of my thick head of hairspare my helmet and this was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud accordingly i removed the roughly hemispherical device and laid it at the entrance of one of the corridorsthe righthand one of the three i must tryi would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct repeating what i seemed to recall as the proper turns and constantly consulting and making notes if i did not get out i would systematically exhaust all possible variations and if these failed i would proceed to cover the avenues extending from the next opening in the same waycontinuing to the third opening if necessary sooner or later i could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit but i must use patience even at worst i could scarcely fail to reach the open plain in time for a dry nights sleepimmediate results were rather discouraging though they helped me eliminate the righthand opening in little more than an hour only a succession of blind alleys each ending at a great distance from the corpse seemed to branch from this hallway and i saw very soon that it had not figured at all in the previous afternoons wanderings as before however i always found it relatively easy to grope back to the central chamberabout 1 pm i shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began to explore the hallways beyond it at first i thought i recognised the turnings but soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of corridors i could not get near the corpse and this time seemed cut off from the central chamber as well even though i thought i had recorded every move i made there seemed to be tricky twists and crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams and i began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement while patience would of course win in the end i saw that my searching would have to be minute tireless and longcontinuedtwo oclock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridorsconstantly feeling my way looking alternately at my helmet and at the corpse and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence i cursed the stupidity and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this tangle of unseen wallsreflecting that if i had let the thing alone and headed back as soon as i had taken the crystal from the body i would even now be safe at terra novasuddenly it occurred to me that i might be able to tunnel under the invisible walls with my knife and thus effect a short cut to the outsideor to some outwardleading corridor i had no means of knowing how deep the buildings foundations were but the omnipresent mud argued the absence of any floor save the earth facing the distant and increasingly horrible corpse i began a course of feverish digging with the broad sharp bladethere was about six inches of semiliquid mud below which the density of the soil increased sharply this lower soil seemed to be of a different coloura greyish clay rather like the formations near venuss north pole as i continued downward close to the unseen barrier i saw that the ground was getting harder and harder watery mud rushed into the excavation as fast as i removed the clay but i reached through it and kept on working if i could bore any kind of a passage beneath the wall the mud would not stop my wriggling outabout three feet down however the hardness of the soil halted my digging seriously its tenacity was beyond anything i had encountered before even on this planet and was linked with an anomalous heaviness my knife had to split and chip the tightly packed clay and the fragments i brought up were like solid stones or bits of metal finally even this splitting and chipping became impossible and i had to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reachthe hourlong attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one for it used up great stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food tablet and to put an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask it has also brought a pause in the days gropings for i am still much too exhausted to walk after cleaning my hands and arms of the worst of the mud i sat down to write these notesleaning against an invisible wall and facing away from the corpsethat body is simply a writhing mass of vermin nowthe odour has begun to draw some of the slimy akmans from the faroff jungle i notice that many of the efjehweeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous feelers toward the thing but i doubt if any are long enough to reach it i wish some really carnivorous organisms like the skorahs would appear for then they might scent me and wriggle a course through the building toward me things like that have an odd sense of direction i could watch them as they came and jot down their approximate route if they failed to form a continuous line even that would be a great help when i met any the pistol would make short work of thembut i can hardly hope for as much as that now that these notes are made i shall rest a while longer and later will do some more groping as soon as i get back to the central chamberwhich ought to be fairly easyi shall try the extreme lefthand opening perhaps i can get outside by dusk after allnightvi 13new trouble my escape will be tremendously difficult for there are elements i had not suspected another night here in the mud and a fight on my hands tomorrow i cut my rest short and was up and groping again by four oclock after about fifteen minutes i reached the central chamber and moved my helmet to mark the last of the three possible doorways starting through this opening i seemed to find the going more familiar but was brought up short in less than five minutes by a sight that jolted me more than i can describeit was a group of four or five of those detestable manlizards emerging from the forest far off across the plain i could not see them distinctly at that distance but thought they paused and turned toward the trees to gesticulate after which they were joined by fully a dozen more the augmented party now began to advance directly toward the invisible building and as they approached i studied them carefully i had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy shadows of the junglethe resemblance to reptiles was perceptible though i knew it was only an apparent one since these beings have no point of contact with terrestrial life when they drew nearer they seemed less truly reptilianonly the flat head and the green slimy froglike skin carrying out the idea they walked erect on their odd thick stumps and their suctiondiscs made curious noises in the mud these were average specimens about seven feet in height and with four long ropy pectoral tentacles the motions of those tentaclesif the theories of fogg ekberg and janat are right which i formerly doubted but am now more ready to believeindicated that the things were in animated conversationi drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight the odds were bad but the weapon gave me a certain advantage if the things knew this building they would come through it after me and in this way would form a key to getting out just as carnivorous skorahs might have done that they would attack me seemed certain for even though they could not see the crystal in my pouch they could divine its presence through that special sense of theirsyet surprisingly enough they did not attack me instead they scattered and formed a vast circle around meat a distance which indicated that they were pressing close to the unseen wall standing there in a ring the beings stared silently and inquisitively at me waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding their heads and gesturing with their upper limbs after a while i saw others issue from the forest and these advanced and joined the curious crowd those near the corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it it was a horrible sight yet the manlizards seemed quite unconcerned now and then one of them would brush away the farnothflies with its limbs or tentacles or crush a wriggling sificligh or akman or an outreaching efjehweed with the suction discs on its stumpsstaring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders and wondering uneasily why they did not attack me at once i lost for the time being the will power and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out instead i leaned limply against the invisible wall of the passage where i stood letting my wonder merge gradually into a chain of the wildest speculations an hundred mysteries which had previously baffled me seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister significance and i trembled with an acute fear unlike anything i had experienced beforei believed i knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly around me i believed too that i had the secret of the transparent structure at last the alluring crystal which i had seized the body of the man who had seized it before meall these things began to acquire a dark and threatening meaningit was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in this roofless unseen tangle of corridors far from it beyond doubt the place was a genuine mazea labyrinth deliberately built by these hellish beings whose craft and mentality i had so badly underestimated might i not have suspected this before knowing of their uncanny architectural skill the purpose was all too plain it was a trapa trap set to catch human beings and with the crystal spheroid as bait these reptilian things in their war on the takers of crystals had turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against usdwightif this rotting corpse were indeed hewas a victim he must have been trapped some time ago and had failed to find his way out lack of water had doubtless maddened him and perhaps he had run out of chlorate cubes as well probably his mask had not slipped accidentally after all suicide was a likelier thing rather than face a lingering death he had solved the issue by removing the mask deliberately and letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once the horrible irony of his fate lay in his positiononly a few feet from the saving exit he had failed to find one minute more of searching and he would have been safeand now i was trapped as he had been trapped and with this circling herd of curious starers to mock at my predicament the thought was maddening and as it sank in i was seized with a sudden flash of panic which set me running aimlessly through the unseen hallways for several moments i was essentially a maniacstumbling tripping bruising myself on the invisible walls and finally collapsing in the mud as a panting lacerated heap of mindless bleeding fleshthe fall sobered me a bit so that when i slowly struggled to my feet i could notice things and exercise my reason the circling watchers were swaying their tentacles in an odd irregular way suggestive of sly alien laughter and i shook my fist savagely at them as i rose my gesture seemed to increase their hideous mirtha few of them clumsily imitating it with their greenish upper limbs shamed into sense i tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situationafter all i was not as badly off as dwight had been unlike him i knew what the situation wasand forewarned is forearmed i had proof that the exit was attainable in the end and would not repeat his tragic act of impatient despair the bodyor skeleton as it would soon bewas constantly before me as a guide to the soughtfor aperture and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if i worked long and intelligently enoughi had however the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian devils now that i realised the nature of the trapwhose invisible material argued a science and technology beyond anything on earthi could no longer discount the mentality and resources of my enemies even with my flame pistol i would have a bad time getting awaythough boldness and quickness would doubtless see me through in the long runbut first i must reach the exteriorunless i could lure or provoke some of the creatures to advance toward me as i prepared my pistol for action and counted over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to me to try the effect of its blasts on the invisible walls had i overlooked a feasible means of escape there was no clue to the chemical composition of the transparent barrier and conceivably it might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese choosing a section facing the corpse i carefully discharged the pistol at close range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed nothing was changed i had seen the flame spread when it struck the surface and now i realised that my hope had been vain only a long tedious search for the exit would ever bring me to the outsideso swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the electrolyser of my mask i recommenced the long quest retracing my steps to the central chamber and starting out anew i constantly consulted my notes and sketches and made fresh onestaking one false turn after another but staggering on in desperation till the afternoon light grew very dim as i persisted in my quest i looked from time to time at the silent circle of mocking starers and noticed a gradual replacement in their ranks every now and then a few would return to the forest while others would arrive to take their places the more i thought of their tactics the less i liked them for they gave me a hint of the creatures possible motives at any time these devils could have advanced and fought me but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles to escape i could not but infer that they enjoyed the spectacleand this made me shrink with double force from the prospect of falling into their handswith the dark i ceased my searching and sat down in the mud to rest now i am writing in the light of my lamp and will soon try to get some sleep i hope tomorrow will see me out for my canteen is low and lacol tablets are a poor substitute for water i would hardly dare to try the moisture in this slime for none of the water in the mudregions is potable except when distilled that is why we run such long pipe lines to the yellow clay regionsor depend on rainwater when those devils find and cut our pipes i have none too many chlorate cubes either and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as i can my tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon and my later panic flight burned up a perilous amount of air tomorrow i will reduce physical exertion to the barest minimum until i meet the reptiles and have to deal with them i must have a good cube supply for the journey back to terra nova my enemies are still on hand i can see a circle of their feeble glowtorches around me there is a horror about those lights which will keep me awakenightvi 14another full day of searching and still no way out i am beginning to be worried about the water problem for my canteen went dry at noon in the afternoon there was a burst of rain and i went back to the central chamber for the helmet which i had left as a markerusing this as a bowl and getting about two cupfuls of water i drank most of it but have put the slight remainder in my canteen lacol tablets make little headway against real thirst and i hope there will be more rain in the night i am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls food tablets are none too plentiful but not dangerously low i shall halve my rations from now on the chlorate cubes are my real worry for even without violent exercise the days endless tramping burned a dangerous number i feel weak from my forced economies in oxygen and from my constantly mounting thirst when i reduce my food i suppose i shall feel still weakerthere is something damnablesomething uncannyabout this labyrinth i could swear that i had eliminated certain turns through charting and yet each new trial belies some assumption i had thought established never before did i realise how lost we are without visual landmarks a blind man might do betterbut for most of us sight is the king of the senses the effect of all these fruitless wanderings is one of profound discouragement i can understand how poor dwight must have felt his corpse is now just a skeleton and the sificlighs and akmans and farnothflies are gone the efjehweeds are nipping the leather clothing to pieces for they were longer and fastergrowing than i had expected and all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand gloatingly around the barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery another day and i shall go mad if i do not drop dead from exhaustionhowever there is nothing to do but persevere dwight would have got out if he had kept on a minute longer it is just possible that somebody from terra nova will come looking for me before long although this is only my third day out my muscles ache horribly and i cant seem to rest at all lying down in this loathsome mud last night despite my terrific fatigue i slept only fitfully and tonight i fear will be no better i live in an endless nightmarepoised between waking and sleeping yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep my hand shakes i can write no more for the time being that circle of feeble glowtorches is hideouslate afternoonvi 15substantial progress looks good very weak and did not sleep much till daylight then i dozed till noon though without being at all rested no rain and thirst leaves me very weak ate an extra food tablet to keep me going but without water it didnt help much i dared to try a little of the slime water just once but it made me violently sick and left me even thirstier than before must save chlorate cubes so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen cant walk much of the time but manage to crawl in the mud about 2 pm i thought i recognised some passages and got substantially nearer to the corpseor skeletonthan i had been since the first days trials i was sidetracked once in a blind alley but recovered the main trail with the aid of my chart and notes the trouble with these jottings is that there are so many of them they must cover three feet of the record scroll and i have to stop for long periods to untangle themmy head is weak from thirst suffocation and exhaustion and i cannot understand all i have set down those damnable green things keep staring and laughing with their tentacles and sometimes they gesticulate in a way that makes me think they share some terrible joke just beyond my perceptionit was three oclock when i really struck my stride there was a doorway which according to my notes i had not traversed before and when i tried it i found i could crawl circuitously toward the weedtwined skeleton the route was a sort of spiral much like that by which i had first reached the central chamber whenever i came to a lateral doorway or junction i would keep to the course which seemed best to repeat that original journey as i circled nearer and nearer to my gruesome landmark the watchers outside intensified their cryptic gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter evidently they saw something grimly amusing in my progressperceiving no doubt how helpless i would be in any encounter with them i was content to leave them to their mirth for although i realised my extreme weakness i counted on the flame pistol and its numerous extra magazines to get me through the vile reptilian phalanxhope now soared high but i did not attempt to rise to my feet better to crawl now and save my strength for the coming encounter with the manlizards my advance was very slow and the danger of straying into some blind alley very great but none the less i seemed to curve steadily toward my osseous goal the prospect gave me new strength and for the nonce i ceased to worry about my pain my thirst and my scant supply of cubes the creatures were now all massing around the entrancegesturing leaping and laughing with their tentacles soon i reflected i would have to face the entire hordeand perhaps such reinforcements as they would receive from the foresti am now only a few yards from the skeleton and am pausing to make this entry before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of entities i feel confident that with my last ounce of strength i can put them to flight despite their numbers for the range of this pistol is tremendous then a camp on the dry moss at the plateaus edge and in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to terra nova i shall be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings again the teeth of that skull gleam and grin horriblytoward nightvi 15horror and despair baffled again after making the previous entry i approached still closer to the skeleton but suddenly encountered an intervening wall i had been deceived once more and was apparently back where i had been three days before on my first futile attempt to leave the labyrinth whether i screamed aloud i do not knowperhaps i was too weak to utter a sound i merely lay dazed in the mud for a long period while the greenish things outside leaped and laughed and gesturedafter a time i became more fully conscious my thirst and weakness and suffocation were fast gaining on me and with my last bit of strength i put a new cube in the electrolyserrecklessly and without regard for the needs of my journey to terra nova the fresh oxygen revived me slightly and enabled me to look about more alertlyit seemed as if i were slightly more distant from poor dwight than i had been at that first disappointment and i dully wondered if i could be in some other corridor a trifle more remote with this faint shadow of hope i laboriously dragged myself forwardbut after a few feet encountered a dead end as i had on the former occasionthis then was the end three days had taken me nowhere and my strength was gone i would soon go mad from thirst and i could no longer count on cubes enough to get me back i feebly wondered why the nightmare things had gathered so thickly around the entrance as they mocked me probably this was part of the mockeryto make me think i was approaching an egress which they knew did not existi shall not last long though i am resolved not to hasten matters as dwight did his grinning skull has just turned toward me shifted by the groping of one of the efjehweeds that are devouring his leather suit the ghoulish stare of those empty eyesockets is worse than the staring of those lizard horrors it lends a hideous meaning to that dead whitetoothed grini shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength i can this recordwhich i hope may reach and warn those who come after mewill soon be done after i stop writing i shall rest a long while then when it is too dark for those frightful creatures to see i shall muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the record scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside i shall take care to send it toward the left where it will not hit the leaping band of mocking beleaguerers perhaps it will be lost forever in the thin mudbut perhaps it will land in some widespread clump of weeds and ultimately reach the hands of menif it does survive to be read i hope it may do more than merely warn men of this trap i hope it may teach our race to let those shining crystals stay where they are they belong to venus alone our planet does not truly need them and i believe we have violated some obscure and mysterious lawsome law buried deep in the arcana of the cosmosin our attempts to take them who can tell what dark potent and widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who guard their treasure so strangely dwight and i have paid as others have paid and will pay but it may be that these scattered deaths are only the prelude of greater horrors to come let us leave to venus that which belongs only to venus i am very near death now and fear i may not be able to throw the scroll when dusk comes if i cannot i suppose the manlizards will seize it for they will probably realise what it is they will not wish anyone to be warned of the labyrinthand they will not know that my message holds a plea in their own behalf as the end approaches i feel more kindly toward the things in the scale of cosmic entity who can say which species stands higher or more nearly approaches a spacewide organic normtheirs or mine i have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my last moments it shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the dying day the leaping horde have noticed it and their gestures have changed in a way i cannot understand i wonder why they keep clustered around the entrance instead of concentrating at a still closer point in the transparent wall i am growing numb and cannot write much more things whirl around me yet i do not lose consciousness can i throw this over the wall that crystal glows so yet the twilight is deepening dark very weak they are still laughing and leaping around the doorway and have started those hellish glowtorches are they going away i dreamed i heard a sound light in the sky report of wesley p miller supt group avenus crystal coterra nova on venusvi 16our operative a49 kenton j stanfield of 5317 marshall street richmond va left terra nova early on vi 12 for a shortterm trip indicated by detector due back 13th or 14th did not appear by evening of 15th so scouting plane fr58 with five men under my command set out at 8 pm to follow route with detector needle shewed no change from earlier readingsfollowed needle to erycinian highland played strong searchlights all the way triplerange flameguns and dradiationcylinders could have dispersed any ordinary hostile force of natives or any dangerous aggregation of carnivorous skorahswhen over the open plain on eryx we saw a group of moving lights which we knew were native glowtorches as we approached they scattered into the forest probably 75 to 100 in all detector indicated crystal on spot where they had been sailing low over this spot our lights picked out objects on the ground skeleton tangled in efjehweeds and complete body ten feet from it brought plane down near bodies and corner of wing crashed on unseen obstructionapproaching bodies on foot we came up short against a smooth invisible barrier which puzzled us enormously feeling along it near the skeleton we struck an opening beyond which was a space with another opening leading to the skeleton the latter though robbed of clothing by weeds had one of the companys numbered metal helmets beside it it was operative b9 frederick n dwight of koenigs division who had been out of terra nova for two months on a long commissionbetween this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another wall but we could easily identify the second man as stanfield he had a record scroll in his left hand and a pen in his right and seemed to have been writing when he died no crystal was visible but the detector indicated a huge specimen near stanfields bodywe had great difficulty in getting at stanfield but finally succeeded the body was still warm and a great crystal lay beside it covered by the shallow mud we at once studied the record scroll in the left hand and prepared to take certain steps based on its data the contents of the scroll forms the long narrative prefixed to this report a narrative whose main descriptions we have verified and which we append as an explanation of what was found the later parts of this account shew mental decay but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst suffocation cardiac strain and psychological depression his mask was in place and freely generating oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supplyour plane being damaged we sent a wireless and called out anderson with repair plane fg7 a crew of wreckers and a set of blasting materials by morning fr58 was fixed and went back under anderson carrying the two bodies and the crystal we shall bury dwight and stanfield in the company graveyard and ship the crystal to chicago on the next earthbound liner later we shall adopt stanfields suggestionthe sound one in the saner earlier part of his reportand bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether with a clear field there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal we can securein the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great care exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords and preparing a complete chart for our archives we were much impressed by the design and shall keep specimens of the substance for chemical analysis all such knowledge will be useful when we take over the various cities of the natives our type c diamond drills were able to bite into the unseen material and wreckers are now planting dynamite preparatory to a thorough blasting nothing will be left when we are done the edifice forms a distinct menace to arial and other possible trafficin considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with the irony of dwights fate but with that of stanfields as well when trying to reach the second body from the skeleton we could find no access on the right but markheim found a doorway from the first inner space some fifteen feet past dwight and four or five past stanfield beyond this was a long hall which we did not explore till later but on the righthand side of that hall was another doorway leading directly to the body stanfield could have reached the outside entrance by walking 22 or 23 feet if he had found the opening which lay directlybehindhiman opening which he overlooked in his exhaustion and despair,1
ifew persons know the inside of the clarendon story or even that there is an inside not reached by the newspapers it was a san francisco sensation in the days before the fire both because of the panic and menace that kept it company and because of its close linkage with the governor of the state governor dalton it will be recalled was clarendons best friend and later married his sister neither dalton nor mrs dalton would ever discuss the painful affair but somehow the facts have leaked out to a limited circle but for that and for the years which have given a sort of vagueness and impersonality to the actors one would still pause before probing into secrets so strictly guarded at the timethe appointment of dr alfred clarendon as medical director of san quentin penitentiary in 189 was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm throughout california san francisco had at last the honour of harbouring one of the greatest biologists and physicians of the period and solid pathological leaders from all over the world might be expected to flock thither to study his methods profit by his advice and researches and learn how to cope with their own local problems california almost over night would become a centre of medical scholarship with earthwide influence and reputationgovernor dalton anxious to spread the news in its fullest significance saw to it that the press carried ample and dignified accounts of his new appointee pictures of dr clarendon and his new home near old goat hill sketches of his career and manifold honours and popular accounts of his salient scientific discoveries were all presented in the principal california dailies till the public soon felt a sort of reflected pride in the man whose studies of pyemia in india of the pest in china and of every sort of kindred disorder elsewhere would soon enrich the world of medicine with an antitoxin of revolutionary importancea basic antitoxin combating the whole febrile principle at its very source and ensuring the ultimate conquest and extirpation of fever in all its diverse formsback of the appointment stretched an extended and not wholly unromantic history of early friendship long separation and dramatically renewed acquaintance james dalton and the clarendon family had been friends in new york ten years beforefriends and more than friends since the doctors only sister georgina was the sweetheart of daltons youth while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his protg in the days of school and college the father of alfred and georgina a wall street pirate of the ruthless elder breed had known daltons father well so well indeed that he had finally stripped him of all he possessed in a memorable afternoons fight on the stock exchange dalton senior hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give his one adored child the benefit of his insurance had promptly blown out his brains but james had not sought to retaliate it was as he viewed it all in the game and he wished no harm to the father of the girl he meant to marry and of the budding young scientist whose admirer and protector he had been throughout their years of fellowship and study instead he turned to the law established himself in a small way and in due course of time asked old clarendon for georginas handold clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly vowing that no pauper and upstart lawyer was fit to be his soninlaw and a scene of considerable violence had occurred james telling the wrinkled freebooter at last what he ought to have been told long before had left the house and the city in a high temper and was embarked within a month upon the california life which was to lead him to the governorship through many a fight with ring and politician his farewells to alfred and georgina had been brief and he had never known the aftermath of that scene in the clarendon library only by a day did he miss the news of old clarendons death from apoplexy and by so missing it changed the course of his whole career he had not written georgina in the decade that followed knowing her loyalty to her father and waiting till his own fortune and position might remove all obstacles to the match nor had he sent any word to alfred whose calm indifference in the face of affection and heroworship had always savoured of conscious destiny and the selfsufficiency of genius secure in the ties of a constancy rare even then he had worked and risen with thoughts only of the future still a bachelor and with a perfect intuitive faith that georgina also was waitingin this faith dalton was not deceived wondering perhaps why no message ever came georgina found no romance save in her dreams and expectations and in the course of time became busy with the new responsibilities brought by her brothers rise to greatness alfreds growth had not belied the promise of his youth and the slim boy had darted quietly up the steps of science with a speed and permanence almost dizzying to contemplate lean and ascetic with steelrimmed pincenez and pointed brown beard dr alfred clarendon was an authority at twentyfive and an international figure at thirty careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of genius he depended vastly on the care and management of his sister and was secretly thankful that her memories of james had kept her from other and more tangible alliancesgeorgina conducted the business and household of the great bacteriologist and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of fever she bore patiently with his eccentricities calmed his occasional bursts of fanaticism and healed those breaches with his friends which now and then resulted from his unconcealed scorn of anything less than a singleminded devotion to pure truth and its progress clarendon was undeniably irritating at times to ordinary folk for he never tired of depreciating the service of the individual as contrasted with the service of mankind as a whole and in censuring men of learning who mingled domestic life or outside interests with their pursuit of abstract science his enemies called him a bore but his admirers pausing before the white heat of ecstasy into which he would work himself became almost ashamed of ever having any standards or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of unalloyed knowledgethe doctors travels were extensive and georgina generally accompanied him on the shorter ones three times however he had taken long lone jaunts to strange and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers and halffabulous plagues for he knew that it is out of the unknown lands of cryptic and immemorial asia that most of the earths diseases spring on each of these occasions he had brought back curious mementoes which added to the eccentricity of his home not least among which was the needlessly large staff of thibetan servants picked up somewhere in utsang during an epidemic of which the world never heard but amidst which clarendon had discovered and isolated the germ of black fever these men taller than most thibetans and clearly belonging to a stock but little investigated in the outside world were of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder whether the doctor had sought to symbolise in them the anatomical models of his college years their aspect in the loose black silk robes of bonpa priests which he chose to give them was grotesque in the highest degree and there was an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which enhanced their air of fantasy and gave georgina a queer awed feeling of having stumbled into the pages ofvathekor thearabian nightsbut queerest of all was the general factotum or clinicman whom clarendon addressed as surama and whom he had brought back with him after a long stay in northern africa during which he had studied certain odd intermittent fevers among the mysterious saharan tuaregs whose descent from the primal race of lost atlantis is an old archaeological rumour surama a man of great intelligence and seemingly inexhaustible erudition was as morbidly lean as the thibetan servants with swarthy parchmentlike skin drawn so tightly over his bald pate and hairless face that every line of the skull stood out in ghastly prominencethis deathshead effect being heightened by lustrelessly burning black eyes set with a depth which left to common visibility only a pair of dark vacant sockets unlike the ideal subordinate he seemed despite his impassive features to spend no effort in concealing such emotions as he possessed instead he carried about an insidious atmosphere of irony or amusement accompanied at certain moments by a deep guttural chuckle like that of a giant turtle which has just torn to pieces some furry animal and is ambling away toward the sea his race appeared to be caucasian but could not be classified more closely than that some of clarendons friends thought he looked like a highcaste hindoo notwithstanding his accentless speech while many agreed with georginawho disliked himwhen she gave her opinion that a pharaohs mummy if miraculously brought to life would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeletondalton absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from eastern interests through the peculiar selfsufficiency of the old west had not followed the meteoric rise of his former comrade clarendon had actually heard nothing of one so far outside his chosen world of science as the governor being of independent and even of abundant means the clarendons had for many years stuck to their old manhattan mansion in east nineteenth street whose ghosts must have looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of surama and the thibetans then through the doctors wish to transfer his base of medical observation the great change had suddenly come and they had crossed the continent to take up a secluded life in san francisco buying the gloomy old bannister place near goat hill overlooking the bay and establishing their strange household in a rambling frenchroofed relic of midvictorian design and goldrush parvenu display set amidst highwalled grounds in a region still half suburbandr clarendon though better satisfied than in new york still felt cramped for lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological theories unworldly as he was he had never thought of using his reputation as an influence to gain public appointment though more and more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or a charitable institutiona prison almshouse or hospitalwould give him a field of sufficient width to complete his researches and make his discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at largethen he had run into james dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in market street as the governor was swinging out of the royal hotel georgina had been with him and an almost instant recognition had heightened the drama of the reunion mutual ignorance of one anothers progress had bred long explanation and histories and clarendon was pleased to find that he had so important an official for a friend dalton and georgina exchanging many a glance felt more than a trace of their youthful tenderness and a friendship was then and there revived which led to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of confidencesjames dalton learned of his old protgs need for political appointment and sought true to his protective role of school and college days to devise some means of giving little alf the needed position and scope he had it is true wide appointive powers but the legislatures constant attacks and encroachments forced him to exercise these with the utmost discretion at length however scarcely three months after the sudden reunion the foremost institutional medical office in the state fell vacant weighing all the elements with care and conscious that his friends achievements and reputation would justify the most substantial rewards the governor felt at last able to act formalities were few and on the eighth of november 189 dr alfred schuyler clarendon became medical director of the california state penitentiary at san quentiniiin scarcely more than a month the hopes of dr clarendons admirers were amply fulfilled sweeping changes in methods brought to the prisons medical routine an efficiency never before dreamed of and though the subordinates were naturally not without jealousy they were obliged to admit the magical results of a really great mans superintendence then came a time where mere appreciation might well have grown to devout thankfulness at a providential conjunction of time place and man for one morning dr jones came to his new chief with a grave face to announce his discovery of a case which he could not but identify as that selfsame black fever whose germ clarendon had found and classifieddr clarendon shewed no surprise but kept on at the writing before himi know he said evenly i came across that case yesterday im glad you recognised it put the man in a separate ward though i dont believe this fever is contagiousdr jones with his own opinion of the maladys contagiousness was glad of this deference to caution and hastened to execute the order upon his return clarendon rose to leave declaring that he would himself take charge of the case alone disappointed in his wish to study the great mans methods and technique the junior physician watched his chief stride away toward the lone ward where he had placed the patient more critical of the new regime than at any time since admiration had displaced his first jealous pangsreaching the ward clarendon entered hastily glancing at the bed and stepping back to see how far dr joness obvious curiosity might have led him then finding the corridor still vacant he shut the door and turned to examine the sufferer the man was a convict of a peculiarly repulsive type and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony his features were frightfully contracted and his knees drawn sharply up in the mute desperation of the stricken clarendon studied him closely raising his tightly shut eyelids took his pulse and temperature and finally dissolving a tablet in water forced the solution between the sufferers lips before long the height of the attack abated as shewn by the relaxing body and returning normality of expression and the patient began to breathe more easily then by a soft rubbing of the ears the doctor caused the man to open his eyes there was life in them for they moved from side to side though they lacked the fine fire which we are wont to deem the image of the soul clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his help had brought feeling behind him the power of an allcapable science he had long known of this case and had snatched the victim from death with the work of a moment another hour and this man would have goneyet jones had seen the symptoms for days before discovering them and having discovered them did not know what to domans conquest of disease however cannot be perfect clarendon assuring the dubious trustynurses that the fever was not contagious had had the patient bathed sponged in alcohol and put to bed but was told the next morning that the case was lost the man had died after midnight in the most intense agony and with such cries and distortions of face that the nurses were driven almost to panic the doctor took this news with his usual calm whatever his scientific feelings may have been and ordered the burial of the patient in quicklime then with a philosophic shrug of the shoulders he made the usual rounds of the penitentiarytwo days later the prison was hit again three men came down at once this time and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever epidemic was under way clarendon having adhered so firmly to his theory of noncontagiousness suffered a distinct loss of prestige and was handicapped by the refusal of the trustynurses to attend the patients theirs was not the soulfree devotion of those who sacrifice themselves to science and humanity they were convicts serving only because of the privileges they could not otherwise buy and when the price became too great they preferred to resign the privilegesbut the doctor was still master of the situation consulting with the warden and sending urgent messages to his friend the governor he saw to it that special rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to the convicts for the dangerous nursing service and by this method succeeded in getting a very fair quota of volunteers he was steeled for action now and nothing could shake his poise and determination additional cases brought only a curt nod and he seemed a stranger to fatigue as he hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone home of sadness and evil more than forty cases developed within another week and nurses had to be brought from the city clarendon went home very seldom at this stage often sleeping on a cot in the wardens quarters and always giving himself up with typical abandon to the service of medicine and of mankindthen came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse san francisco news will out and the menace of black fever spread over the town like a fog from the bay reporters trained in the doctrine of sensation first used their imagination without restraint and gloried when at last they were able to produce a case in the mexican quarter which a local physicianfonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic welfarepronounced black feverthat was the last straw frantic at the thought of the crawling death so close upon them the people of san francisco went mad en masse and embarked upon that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to hear over busy wires ferries and rowboats excursion steamers and launches railways and cable cars bicycles and carriages movingvans and work carts all were pressed into instant and frenzied service sausalito and tamalpais as lying in the direction of san quentin shared in the flight while housing space in oakland berkeley and alameda rose to fabulous prices tent colonies sprang up and improvised villages lined the crowded southward highways from millbrae to san jose many sought refuge with friends in sacramento while the frightshaken residue forced by various causes to stay behind could do little more than maintain the basic necessities of a nearly dead citybusiness save for quack doctors with sure cures and preventives for use against the fever fell rapidly to the vanishingpoint at first the saloons offered medicated drinks but soon found that the populace preferred to be duped by charlatans of more professional aspect in strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one anothers faces to glimpse possible plague symptoms and shopkeepers began more and more to refuse admission to their clientele each customer seeming to them a fresh fever menace legal and judicial machinery began to disintegrate as attorneys and county clerks succumbed one by one to the urge for flight even the doctors deserted in large numbers many of them pleading the need of vacations among the mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the state schools and colleges theatres and cafs restaurants and saloons all gradually closed their doors and in a single week san francisco lay prostrate and inert with only its light power and water service even half normal with newspapers in skeletonic form and with a crippled parody on transportation maintained by the horse and cable carsthis was the lowest ebb it could not last long for courage and observation are not altogether dead in mankind and sooner or later the nonexistence of any widespread black fever epidemic outside san quentin became too obvious a fact to deny notwithstanding several actual cases and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary suburban tent colonies the leaders and editors of the community conferred and took action enlisting in their service the very reporters whose energies had done so much to bring on the trouble but now turning their sensation first avidity into more constructive channels editorials and fictitious interviews appeared telling of dr clarendons complete control of the disease and of the absolute impossibility of its diffusion beyond the prison walls reiteration and circulation slowly did their work and gradually a slim backward trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous refluent stream one of the first healthy symptoms was the start of a newspaper controversy of the approved acrimonious kind attempting to fix blame for the panic wherever the various participants thought it belonged the returning doctors jealously strengthened by their timely vacations began striking at clarendon assuring the public that they as well as he would keep the fever in leash and censuring him for not doing even more to check its spread within san quentinclarendon had they averred permitted far more deaths than were necessary the veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever contagion and if this renowned savant did not do it it was clearly because he chose for scientific reasons to study the final effects of the disease rather than to prescribe properly and save the victims this policy they insinuated might be proper enough among convicted murderers in a penal institution but it would not do in san francisco where life was still a precious and sacred thing thus they went on and the papers were glad to publish all they wrote since the sharpness of the campaign in which dr clarendon would doubtless join would help to obliterate confusion and restore confidence among the peoplebut clarendon did not reply he only smiled while his singular clinicman surama indulged in many a deep testudinous chuckle he was at home more nowadays so that reporters began besieging the gate of the great wall the doctor had built around his house instead of pestering the wardens office at san quentin results though were equally meagre for surama formed an impassable barrier between the doctor and the outer worldeven after the reporters had got into the grounds the newspaper men getting access to the front hall had glimpses of clarendons singular entourage and made the best they could in a writeup of surama and the queer skeletonic thibetans exaggeration of course occurred in every fresh article and the net effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the great physician most persons hate the unusual and hundreds who could have excused heartlessness or incompetence stood ready to condemn the grotesque taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eight blackrobed orientalsearly in january an especially persistent young man from theobserverclimbed the moated eightfoot brick wall in the rear of the clarendon grounds and began a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which trees concealed from the front walk with quick alert brain he took in everythingthe rosearbour the aviaries the animal cages where all sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guineapigs might be seen and heard the stout wooden clinic building with barred windows in the northwest corner of the yardand bent searching glances throughout the thousand square feet of intramural privacy a great article was brewing and he would have escaped unscathed but for the barking of dick georgina clarendons gigantic and beloved st bernard surama instant in his response had the youth by the collar before a protest could be uttered and was presently shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat and dragging him through the trees to the front yard and the gatebreathless explanations and quavering demands to see dr clarendon were useless surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on suddenly a positive fright crept over the dapper scribe and he began to wish desperately that this unearthly creature would speak if only to prove that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this planet he became deathly sick and strove not to glimpse the eyes which he knew must lie at the base of those gaping black sockets soon he heard the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through in another moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly and muddily in the ditch which clarendon had had dug around the entire length of the wall fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive gate slam shut and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the forbidding portal then as he turned to go a soft sound grated behind him and through a small wicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of surama and heard the echoes of a deepvoiced bloodfreezing chucklethis young man feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been rougher than he deserved resolved to revenge himself upon the household responsible for his treatment accordingly he prepared a fictitious interview with dr clarendon supposed to be held in the clinic building during which he was careful to describe the agonies of a dozen black fever patients whom his imagination ranged on orderly rows of couches his masterstroke was the picture of one especially pathetic sufferer gasping for water while the doctor held a glass of the sparkling fluid just out of his reach in a scientific attempt to determine the effect of a tantalising emotion on the course of the disease this invention was followed by paragraphs of insinuating comment so outwardly respectful that it bore a double venom dr clarendon was the article ran undoubtedly the greatest and most singleminded scientist in the world but science is no friend to individual welfare and one would not like to have ones gravest ills drawn out and aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on some point of abstract truth life is too short for thataltogether the article was diabolically skilful and succeeded in horrifying nine readers out of ten against dr clarendon and his supposed methods other papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its substance taking the cue it offered and commencing a series of faked interviews which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy in no case however did the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction he had no time to waste on fools and liars and cared little for the esteem of a thoughtless rabble he despised when james dalton telegraphed his regrets and offered aid clarendon replied with an almost boorish curtness he did not heed the barking of dogs and could not bother to muzzle them nor would he thank anyone for messing with a matter wholly beneath notice silent and contemptuous he continued his duties with tranquil evennessbut the young reporters spark had done its work san francisco was insane again and this time as much with rage as with fear sober judgment became a lost art and though no second exodus occurred there ensued a reign of vice and recklessness born of desperation and suggesting parallel phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence hatred ran riot against the man who had found the disease and was struggling to restrain it and a lightheaded public forgot his great services to knowledge in their efforts to fan the flames of resentment they seemed in their blindness to hate him in person rather than the plague which had come to their breezecleaned and usually healthy citythen the young reporter playing in the neronic fire he had kindled added a crowning personal touch of his own remembering the indignities he had suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinicman he prepared a masterly article on the home and environment of dr clarendon giving especial prominence to surama whose very aspect he declared sufficient to scare the healthiest person into any sort of fever he tried to make the gaunt chuckler appear equally ridiculous and terrible succeeding best perhaps in the latter half of his intention since a tide of horror always welled up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to the creature he collected all the rumours current about the man elaborated on the unholy depth of his reputed scholarship and hinted darkly that it could have been no godly realm of secret and aeonweighted africa wherein dr clarendon had found himgeorgina who followed the papers closely felt crushed and hurt by these attacks upon her brother but james dalton who called often at the house did his best to comfort her in this he was warm and sincere for he wished not only to console the woman he loved but to utter some measure of the reverence he had always felt for the starwardbound genius who had been his youths closest comrade he told georgina how greatness can never be exempted from the shafts of envy and cited the long sad list of splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar heels the attacks he pointed out formed the truest of all proofs of alfreds solid eminencebut they hurt just the same she rejoined and all the more because i know that al really suffers from them no matter how indifferent he tries to bedalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among wellborn personsand it hurts me a thousand times more knowing that it hurts you and alf but never mind georgie well stand together and pull through itthus it came about that georgina came more and more to rely on the strength of the steelfirm squarejawed governor who had been her youthful swain and more and more to confide in him the things she feared the press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all there were aspects of the household which she did not like surama cruel in equal measure to man and beast filled her with the most unnamable repulsion and she could not but feel that he meant some vague indefinable harm to alfred she did not like the thibetans either and thought it very peculiar that surama was able to talk with them alfred would not tell her who or what surama was but had once explained rather haltingly that he was a much older man than would be commonly thought credible and that he had mastered secrets and been through experiences calculated to make him a colleague of phenomenal value for any scientist seeking natures hidden mysteriesurged by her uneasiness dalton became a still more frequent visitor at the clarendon home though he saw that his presence was deeply resented by surama the bony clinicman formed the habit of glaring peculiarly from those spectral sockets when admitting him and would often after closing the gate when he left chuckle monotonously in a manner that made his flesh creep meanwhile dr clarendon seemed oblivious of everything save his work at san quentin whither he went each day in his launchalone save for surama who managed the wheel while the doctor read or collated his notes dalton welcomed these regular absences for they gave him constant opportunities to renew his suit for georginas hand when he would overstay and meet alfred however the latters greeting was always friendly despite his habitual reserve in time the engagement of james and georgina grew to be a definite thing and the two awaited only a favourable chance to speak to alfredthe governor wholesouled in everything and firm in his protective loyalty spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friends behalf press and officialdom both felt his influence and he even succeeded in interesting scientists in the east many of whom came to california to study the plague and investigate the antifever bacillus which clarendon was so rapidly isolating and perfecting these doctors and biologists however did not obtain the information they wished so that several of them left with a very unfortunate impression not a few prepared articles hostile to clarendon accusing him of an unscientific and fameseeking attitude and intimating that he concealed his methods through a highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profitothers fortunately were more liberal in their judgments and wrote enthusiastically of clarendon and his work they had seen the patients and could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in leash his secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite justifiable since its public diffusion in unperfected form could not but do more harm than good clarendon himself whom many of their number had met before impressed them more profoundly than ever and they did not hesitate to compare him with jenner lister koch pasteur metchnikoff and the rest of those whose whole lives have served pathology and humanity dalton was careful to save for alfred all the magazines that spoke well of him bringing them in person as an excuse to see georgina they did not however produce much effect save a contemptuous smile and clarendon would generally throw them to surama whose deep disturbing chuckle upon reading formed a close parallel to the doctors own ironic amusementone monday evening early in february dalton called with the definite intention of asking clarendon for his sisters hand georgina herself admitted him to the grounds and as they walked toward the house he stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore paws on his breast it was dick georginas cherished st bernard and dalton was glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which meant so much to herdick was excited and glad and turned the governor nearly half about with his vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off through the trees toward the clinic he did not vanish though but presently stopped and looked back softly barking again as if he wished dalton to follow georgina fond of obeying her huge pets playful whims motioned to james to see what he wanted and they both walked slowly after him as he trotted relievedly to the rear of the yard where the top of the clinic building stood silhouetted against the stars above the great brick wallthe outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark windowcurtains so they knew that alfred and surama were at work suddenly from the interior came a thin subdued sound like a cry of a childa plaintive call of mamma mamma at which dick barked while james and georgina started perceptibly then georgina smiled remembering the parrots that clarendon always kept for experimental uses and patted dick on the head either to forgive him for having fooled her and dalton or to console him for having been fooled himselfas they turned slowly toward the house dalton mentioned his resolve to speak to alfred that evening about their engagement and georgina supplied no objection she knew that her brother would not relish the loss of a faithful manager and companion but believed his affection would place no barrier in the way of her happinesslater that evening clarendon came into the house with a springy step and aspect less grim than usual dalton seeing a good omen in this easy buoyancy took heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial ah jimmy hows politics this year he glanced at georgina and she quietly excused herself while the two men settled down to a chat on general subjects little by little amidst many reminders of their old youthful days dalton worked toward his point till at last he came out plainly with the crucial queryalf i want to marry georgina have we your blessingkeenly watching his old friend dalton saw a shadow steal over his face the dark eyes flashed for a moment then veiled themselves as wonted placidity returned so science or selfishness was at work after allyoure asking an impossibility james georgina isnt the aimless butterfly she was years ago she has a place in the service of truth and mankind now and that place is here shes decided to devote her life to my workto the household that makes my work possibleand theres no room for desertion or personal capricedalton waited to see if he had finished the same old fanaticismhumanity versus the individualand the doctor was going to let it spoil his sisters life then he tried to answerbut look here alf do you mean to say that georgina in particular is so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr of her use your sense of proportion man if it were a question of surama or somebody in the utter thick of your experiments it might be different but after all georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the last analysis she has promised to be my wife and says that she loves me have you the right to cut her off from the life that belongs to her have you the rightthatll do james clarendons face was set and white whether or not i have the right to govern my own family is no business of an outsideroutsideryou can say that to a man who dalton almost choked as the steely voice of the doctor interrupted him againan outsider to my family and from now on an outsider to my home dalton your presumption goes just a little too far good evening governorand clarendon strode from the room without extending his handdalton hesitated for a moment almost at a loss what to do when presently georgina entered her face shewed that she had spoken with her brother and dalton took both her hands impetuouslywell georgie what do you say im afraid its a choice between alf and me you know how i feelyou know how i felt before when it was your father i was up against whats your answer this timehe paused as she responded slowlyjames dear do you believe that i love youhe nodded and pressed her hands expectantlythen if you love me youll wait a while dont think of als rudeness hes to be pitied i cant tell you the whole thing now but you know how worried i amwhat with the strain of his work the criticisms and the staring and cackling of that horrible creature surama im afraid hell break downhe shews the strain more than anyone outside the family could tell i can see it for ive watched him all my life hes changingslowly bending under his burdensand he puts on his extra brusqueness to hide it you can see what i mean cant you dearshe paused and dalton nodded again pressing one of her hands to his breast then she concludedso promise me dear to be patient i must stand by him i must i mustdalton did not speak for a while but his head inclined in what was almost a bow of reverence there was more of christ in this devoted woman than he had thought any human being possessed and in the face of such love and loyalty he could do no urgingwords of sadness and parting were brief and james whose blue eyes were misty scarcely saw the gaunt clinicman as the gate to the street was at last opened to him but when it slammed to behind him he heard that bloodcurdling chuckle he had come to recognise so well and knew that surama was theresurama whom georgina had called her brothers evil genius walking away with a firm step dalton resolved to be watchful and to act at the first sign of troubleiiimeanwhile san francisco the epidemic still on the lips of all seethed with anticlarendon feeling actually the cases outside the penitentiary were very few and confined almost wholly to the lower mexican element whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitation to disease of every kind but politicians and the people needed no more than this to confirm the attacks made by the doctors enemies seeing that dalton was immovable in his championship of clarendon the malcontents medical dogmatists and wardheelers turned their attention to the state legislature lining up the anticlarendonists and the governors old enemies with great shrewdness and preparing to launch a lawwith a vetoproof majoritytransferring the authority for minor institutional appointments from the chief executive to the various boards or commissions concernedin the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than clarendons chief assistant dr jones jealous of his superior from the first he now saw an opportunity for turning matters to his liking and he thanked fate for the circumstanceresponsible indeed for his present positionof his relationship to the chairman of the prison board the new law if passed would certainly mean the removal of clarendon and the appointment of himself in his stead so mindful of his own interest he worked hard for it jones was all that clarendon was nota natural politician and sycophantic opportunist who served his own advancement first and science only incidentally he was poor and avid for salaried position quite in contrast to the wealthy and independent savant he sought to displace so with a ratlike cunning and persistence he laboured to undermine the great biologist above him and was one day rewarded by the news that the new law was passed thenceforward the governor was powerless to make appointments to the state institutions and the medical directorship of san quentin lay at the disposal of the prison boardof all this legislative turmoil clarendon was singularly oblivious wrapped wholly in matters of administration and research he was blind to the treason of that ass jones who worked by his side and deaf to all the gossip of the wardens office he had never in his life read the newspapers and the banishment of dalton from his house cut off his last real link with the world of outside events with the naivet of a recluse he at no time thought of his position as insecure in view of daltons loyalty and of his forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs as shewn in his dealings with the elder clarendon who had crushed his father to death on the stock exchange the possibility of a gubernatorial dismissal was of course out of the question nor could the doctors political ignorance envisage a sudden shift of power which might place the matter of retention or dismissal in very different hands thereupon he merely smiled with satisfaction when dalton left for sacramento convinced that his place in san quentin and his sisters place in his household were alike secure from disturbance he was accustomed to having what he wanted and fancied his luck was still holding outthe first week in march a day or so after the enactment of the new law the chairman of the prison board called at san quentin clarendon was out but dr jones was glad to shew the august visitorhis own uncle incidentallythrough the great infirmary including the fever ward made so famous by press and panic by this time converted against his will to clarendons belief in the fevers noncontagiousness jones smilingly assured his uncle that nothing was to be feared and encouraged him to inspect the patients in detailespecially a ghastly skeleton once a very giant of bulk and vigour who was he insinuated slowly and painfully dying because clarendon would not administer the proper medicinedo you mean to say cried the chairman that dr clarendon refuses to let the man have what he needs knowing his life could be savedjust that snapped dr jones pausing as the door opened to admit none other than clarendon himself clarendon nodded coldly to jones and surveyed the visitor whom he did not know with disapprovaldr jones i thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at all and havent i said that visitors arent to be admitted except by special permissionbut the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce himpardon me dr clarendon but am i to understand that you refuse to give this man the medicine that would save himclarendon glared coldly and rejoined with steel in his voicethats an impertinent question sir i am in authority here and visitors are not allowed please leave the room at oncethe chairman his sense of drama secretly tickled answered with greater pomp and hauteur than were necessaryyou mistake me sir i not you am master here you are addressing the chairman of the prison board i must say moreover that i deem your activity a menace to the welfare of the prisoners and must request your resignation henceforth dr jones will be in charge and if you wish to remain until your formal dismissal you will take your orders from himit was wilfred joness great moment life never gave him another such climax and we need not grudge him this one after all he was a small rather than a bad man and he had only obeyed a small mans code of looking to himself at all costs clarendon stood still gazing at the speaker as if he thought him mad till in another second the look of triumph on dr joness face convinced him that something important was indeed afoot he was icily courteous as he repliedno doubt you are what you claim to be sir but fortunately my appointment came from the governor of the state and can therefore be revoked only by himthe chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly for they had not realised to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go then the older man grasping the situation explained at some lengthhad i found that the current reports did you an injustice he concluded i would have deferred action but the case of this poor man and your own arrogant manner left me no choice as it isbut dr clarendon interrupted with a new razorsharpness in his voiceas it is i am the director in charge at present and i ask you to leave this room at oncethe chairman reddened and explodedlook here sir who do you think youre talking to ill have you chucked out of heredamn your impertinencebut he had time only to finish the sentence transformed by the insult to a sudden dynamo of hate the slender scientist launched out with both fists in a burst of preternatural strength of which no one would have thought him capable and if his strength was preternatural his accuracy of aim was no less so for not even a champion of the ring could have wrought a neater result both menthe chairman and dr joneswere squarely hit the one full in the face and the other on the point of the chin going down like felled trees they lay motionless and unconscious on the floor while clarendon now clear and completely master of himself took his hat and cane and went out to join surama in the launch only when seated in the moving boat did he at last give audible vent to the frightful rage that consumed him then with face convulsed he called down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs beyond the stars so that even surama shuddered made an elder sign that no book of history records and forgot to chuckleivgeorgina soothed her brothers hurt as best she could he had come home mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library lounge and in that gloomy room little by little the faithful sister had taken in the almost incredible news her consolations were instantaneous and tender and she made him realise how vast though unconscious a tribute to his greatness the attacks persecution and dismissal all were he had tried to cultivate the indifference she preached and could have done so had personal dignity alone been involved but the loss of scientific opportunity was more than he could calmly bear and he sighed again and again as he repeated how three months more of study in the prison might have given him at last the longsought bacillus which would make all fever a thing of the pastthen georgina tried another mode of cheering and told him that surely the prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate or if it broke out with increased force but even this was ineffective and clarendon answered only in a string of bitter ironic and halfmeaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how deeply despair and resentment had bittenabate break out again oh itll abate all right at least theyll think it has abated theyd think anything no matter what happens ignorant eyes see nothing and bunglers are never discoverers science never shews her face to that sort and they call themselves doctors best of all fancy that ass jones in chargeceasing with a quick sneer he laughed so daemoniacally that georgina shiveredthe days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the clarendon mansion depression stark and unrelieved had taken hold of the doctors usually tireless mind and he would even have refused food had not georgina forced it upon him his great notebook of observations lay unopened on the library table and his little gold syringe of antifever seruma clever device of his own with a selfcontained reservoir attached to a broad gold finger ring and singlepressure action peculiar to itselfrested idly in a small leather case beside it vigour ambition and the desire for study and observation seemed to have died within him and he made no inquiries about his clinic where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderly phials awaiting his attentionthe countless animals held for experiments played lively and well fed in the early spring sunshine and as georgina strolled out through the rosearbour to the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of happiness about her she knew though how tragically transient that happiness must be since the start of new work would soon make all these small creatures unwilling martyrs to science knowing this she glimpsed a sort of compensating element in her brothers inaction and encouraged him to keep on in a rest he needed so badly the eight thibetan servants moved noiselessly about each as impeccably effective as usual and georgina saw to it that the order of the household did not suffer because of the masters relaxationstudy and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressinggowned indifference clarendon was content to let georgina treat him as an infant he met her maternal fussiness with a slow sad smile and always obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts a kind of faint wistful felicity came over the languid household amidst which the only dissenting note was supplied by surama he indeed was miserable and looked often with sullen and resentful eyes at the sunny serenity in georginas face his only joy had been the turmoil of experiment and he missed the routine of seizing the fated animals bearing them to the clinic in clutching talons and watching them with hot brooding gaze and evil chuckles as they gradually fell into the final coma with wideopened redrimmed eyes and swollen tongue lolling from frothcovered mouthnow he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree creatures in their cages and frequently came to ask clarendon if there were any orders finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin work he would go away muttering under his breath and glaring curses upon everything stealing with catlike tread to his own quarters in the basement where his voice would sometimes ascend in deep muffled rhythms of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortably ritualistic suggestionall this wore on georginas nerves but not by any means so gravely as her brothers continued lassitude itself the duration of the state alarmed her and little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness which had so provoked the clinicman herself skilled in medicine she found the doctors condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienists point of view and she now feared as much from his absence of interest and activity as she had formerly feared from his fanatical zeal and overstudy was lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant man of intellect into an innocuous imbecilethen toward the end of may came the sudden change georgina always recalled the smallest details connected with it details as trivial as the box delivered to surama the day before postmarked algiers and emitting a most unpleasant odour and the sharp sudden thunderstorm rare in the extreme for california which sprang up that night as surama chanted his rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning chestvoice louder and more intense than usualit was a sunny day and she had been in the garden gathering flowers for the diningroom reentering the house she glimpsed her brother in the library fully dressed and seated at the table alternately consulting the notes in his thick observation book and making fresh entries with brisk assured strokes of the pen he was alert and vital and there was a satisfying resilience about his movements as he now and then turned a page or reached for a book from the rear of the great table delighted and relieved georgina hastened to deposit her flowers in the diningroom and return but when she reached the library again she found that her brother was goneshe knew of course that he must be in the clinic at work and rejoiced to think that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into place realising it would be of no use to delay the luncheon for him she ate alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in case of his return at an odd moment but he did not come he was making up for lost time and was still in the great stoutplanked clinic when she went for a stroll through the rosearbouras she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw surama fetching animals for the test she wished she could notice him less for he always made her shudder but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and ears where he was concerned he always went hatless around the yard and the total hairlessness of his head enhanced his skeletonlike aspect horribly now she heard a faint chuckle as he took a small monkey from its cage against the wall and carried it to the clinic his long bony fingers pressing so cruelly into its furry sides that it cried out in frightened anguish the sight sickened her and brought her walk to an end her inmost soul rebelled at the ascendancy this creature had gained over her brother and she reflected bitterly that the two had almost changed places as master and servantnight came without clarendons return to the house and georgina concluded that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions which meant total disregard of time she hated to retire without a talk with him about his sudden recovery but finally feeling it would be futile to wait up she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his chair on the library table then started resolutely for bedshe was not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut so it had not been an allnight session after all determined to see that her brother had a meal before retiring she rose slipped on a robe and descended to the library halting only when she heard voices from behind the halfopened door clarendon and surama were talking and she waited till the clinicman might gosurama however shewed no inclination to depart and indeed the whole heated tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise length georgina though she had not meant to listen could not help catching a phrase now and then and presently became aware of a sinister undercurrent which frightened her very much without being wholly clear to her her brothers voice nervous incisive held her notice with disquieting persistencebut anyway he was saying we havent enough animals for another day and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short notice it seems silly to waste so much effort on comparative trash when human specimens could be had with just a little extra caregeorgina sickened at the possible implication and caught at the hall rack to steady herself surama was replying in that deep hollow tone which seemed to echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand planetssteady steadywhat a child you are with your haste and impatience you crowd things so when youve lived as i have so that a whole life will seem only an hour you wont be so fretful about a day or week or month you work too fast youve plenty of specimens in the cages for a full week if youll only go at a sensible rate you might even begin on the older material if youd be sure not to overdo itnever mind my haste the reply was snapped out sharply i have my own methods i dont want to use our material if i can help it for i prefer them as they are and youd better be careful of them anywayyou know the knives those sly dogs carrysuramas deep chuckle camedont worry about that the brutes eat dont they well i can get you one any time you need it but go slowwith the boy gone there are only eight and now that youve lost san quentin itll be hard to get new ones by the wholesale id advise you to start in on tsanpohes the least use to you as he is andbut that was all georgina heard transfixed by a hideous dread from the thoughts this talk excited she nearly sank to the floor where she stood and was scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her room what was the evil monster surama planning into what was he guiding her brother what monstrous circumstances lay behind these cryptic sentences a thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced before her eyes and she flung herself upon the bed without hope of sleep one thought above the rest stood out with fiendish prominence and she almost screamed aloud as it beat itself into her brain with renewed force then nature kinder than she expected intervened at last closing her eyes in a dead faint she did not awake till morning nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the lasting one which the overheard words had broughtwith the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension what happens in the night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in distorted forms and georgina could see that her brain must have given strange colour to scraps of common medical conversation to suppose her brotheronly son of the gentle frances schuyler clarendonguilty of savage sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to their blood and she decided to omit all mention of her trip downstairs lest alfred ridicule her fantastic notionswhen she reached the breakfast table she found that clarendon was already gone and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a chance to congratulate him on his revived activity quietly taking the breakfast served by stonedeaf old margarita the mexican cook she read the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the sittingroom window overlooking the great yard all was silent out there and she could see that the last of the animal cages had been emptied science was served and the limepit held all that was left of the once pretty and lively little creatures this slaughter had always grieved her but she had never complained since she knew it was all for humanity being a scientists sister she used to say to herself was like being the sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen from their foesafter luncheon georgina resumed her post by the window and had been busily sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the yard caused her to look out in alarm there not far from the clinic she saw the ghastly form of surama a revolver in his hand and his skullface twisted into a strange expression as he chuckled at a cowering figure robed in black silk and carrying a long thibetan knife it was the servant tsanpo and as she recognised the shrivelled face georgina remembered horribly what she had overheard the night before the sun flashed on the polished blade and suddenly suramas revolver spat once more this time the knife flew from the mongols hand and surama glanced greedily at his shaking and bewildered preythen tsanpo glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen knife sprang nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinicman and made a dash for the house surama however was too swift for him and caught him in a single leap seizing his shoulder and almost crushing him for a moment the thibetan tried to struggle but surama lifted him like an animal by the scruff of the neck and bore him off toward the clinic georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the man in his own tongue and saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver with fright suddenly realising against her own will what was taking place a great horror mastered her and she fainted for the second time within twentyfour hourswhen consciousness returned the golden light of late afternoon was flooding the room georgina picking up her fallen workbasket and scattered materials was lost in a daze of doubt but finally felt convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have been all too tragically real her worst fears then were horrible truths what to do about it nothing in her experience could tell her and she was vaguely thankful that her brother did not appear she must talk to him but not now she could not talk to anybody now and thinking shudderingly of the monstrous happening behind those barred clinic windows she crept into bed for a long night of anguished sleeplessnessrising haggardly on the following day georgina saw the doctor for the first time since his recovery he was bustling about preoccupiedly circulating between the house and the clinic and paying little attention to anything besides his work there was no chance for the dreaded interview and clarendon did not even notice his sisters wornout aspect and hesitant mannerin the evening she heard him in the library talking to himself in a fashion most unusual for him and she felt that he was under a great strain which might culminate in the return of his apathy entering the room she tried to calm him without referring to any trying subject and forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him finally she asked gently what was distressing him and waited anxiously for his reply hoping to hear that suramas treatment of the poor thibetan had horrified and outraged himthere was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he respondedwhats distressing me good god georgina whatisntlook at the cages and see if you have to ask again cleaned outmilked drynot a cursed specimen left and a line of the most important bacterial cultures incubating in their tubes without a chance to do an ounce of good days work wastedwhole programme set backits enough to drive a man mad how shall i ever get anywhere if i cant scrape up some decent subjectsgeorgina stroked his foreheadi think you ought to rest a while al dearhe moved awayrest thats good thats damn good what else have i been doing but resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last fifty or a hundred or a thousand years just as i manage to shake off the clouds i have to run short of materialand then im told to lapse back again into drooling stupefaction god and all the while some sneaking thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to come out ahead of me with the credit for my own work ill lose by a necksome fool with the proper specimens will get the prize when one week more with even halfadequate facilities would see me through with flying colourshis voice rose querulously and there was an overtone of mental strain which georgina did not like she answered softly yet not so softly as to hint at the soothing of a psychopathic casebut youre killing yourself with this worry and tension and if youre dead how can you do your workhe gave a smile that was almost a sneeri guess a week or a monthall the time i needwouldnt quite finish me and it doesnt much matter what becomes of me or any other individual in the end science is what must be servedsciencethe austere cause of human knowledge im like the monkeys and birds and guineapigs i usejust a cog in the machine to be used to the advantage of the whole they had to be killedi may have to be killedwhat of it isnt the cause we serve worth that and moregeorgina sighed for a moment she wondered whether after all this ceaseless round of slaughter really was worth whilebut are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to humanity to warrant these sacrificesclarendons eyes flashed dangerouslyhumanity what the deuce is humanity science dolts just individuals over and over again humanity is made for preachers to whom it means the blindly credulous humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom it speaks in terms of dollars and cents humanity is made for the politician to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his advantage what is humanity nothing thank god that crude illusion doesnt last what a grown man worships is truthknowledgesciencelightthe rending of the veil and the pushing back of the shadow knowledge the juggernaut there is death in our own ritual we must killdissectdestroyand all for the sake of discoverythe worship of the ineffable light the goddess science demands it we test a doubtful poison by killing how else no thought for selfjust knowledgethe effect must be knownhis voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion and georgina shuddered slightlybut this is horrible al you shouldnt think of it that wayclarendon cackled sardonically in a manner which stirred odd and repugnant associations in his sisters mindhorrible you think whatisay is horrible you ought to hear surama i tell you things were known to the priests of atlantis that would have you drop dead of fright if you heard a hint of them knowledge was knowledge a hundred thousand years ago when our especial forbears were shambling about asia as speechless semiapes they know something of it in the hoggar regionthere are rumours in the farther uplands of thibetand once i heard an old man in china calling on yogsothothhe turned pale and made a curious sign in the air with his extended forefinger georgina felt genuinely alarmed but became somewhat calmer as his speech took a less fantastic formyes it may be horrible but its glorious too the pursuit of knowledge i mean certainly theres no slovenly sentiment connected with it doesnt nature killconstantly and remorselesslyand are any but fools horrified at the struggle killings are necessary they are the glory of science we learn something from them and we cant sacrifice learning to sentiment hear the sentimentalists howl against vaccination they fear it will kill the child well what if it does how else can we discover the laws of disease concerned as a scientists sister you ought to know better than to prate sentiment you ought to help my work instead of hindering itbut al protested georgina i havent the slightest intention of hindering your work havent i always tried to help as much as i could i am ignorant i suppose and cant help very actively but at least im proud of youproud for my own sake and for the familys sakeand ive always tried to smooth the way youve given me credit for that many a timeclarendon looked at her keenlyyes he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room youre right youve always tried to help as best you knew you may yet have a chance to help still moregeorgina seeing him disappear through the front door followed him into the yard some distance away a lantern was shining through the trees and as they approached it they saw surama bending over a large object stretched on the ground clarendon advancing gave a short grunt but when georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek it was dick the great st bernard and he was lying still with reddened eyes and protruding tonguehes sick al she cried do something for him quickthe doctor looked at surama who had uttered something in a tongue unknown to georginatake him to the clinic he ordered im afraid dicks caught the feversurama took up the dog as he had taken poor tsanpo the day before and carried him silently to the building near the wall he did not chuckle this time but glanced at clarendon with what appeared to be real anxiety it almost seemed to georgina that surama was asking the doctor to save her petclarendon however made no move to follow but stood still for a moment and then sauntered slowly toward the house georgina astonished at such callousness kept up a running fire of entreaties on dicks behalf but it was of no use without paying the slightest attention to her pleas he made directly for the library and began to read in a large old book which had lain face down on the table she put her hand on his shoulder as he sat there but he did not speak or turn his head he only kept on reading and georgina glancing curiously over his shoulder wondered in what strange alphabet this brassbound tome was writtenin the cavernous parlour across the hall sitting alone in the dark a quarter of an hour later georgina came to her decision something was gravely wrongjust what and to what extent she scarcely dared formulate to herselfand it was time that she called in some stronger force to help her of course it must be james he was powerful and capable and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing to do he had known al always and would understandit was by this time rather late but georgina had resolved on action across the hall the light still shone from the library and she looked wistfully at the doorway as she quietly donned a hat and left the house outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds it was only a short walk to jackson street where by good luck she found a carriage to take her to the western union telegraph office there she carefully wrote out a message to james dalton in sacramento asking him to come at once to san francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them allvdalton was frankly perplexed by georginas sudden message he had had no word from the clarendons since that stormy february evening when alfred had declared him an outsider to his home and he in turn had studiously refrained from communicating even when he had longed to express sympathy after the doctors summary ousting from office he had fought hard to frustrate the politicians and keep the appointive power and was bitterly sorry to watch the unseating of a man who despite recent estrangements still represented to him the ultimate ideal of scientific competencenow with this clearly frightened summons before him he could not imagine what had happened he knew though that georgina was not one to lose her head or send forth a needless alarm hence he wasted no time but took the overland which left sacramento within the hour going at once to his club and sending word to georgina by a messenger that he was in town and wholly at her servicemeanwhile things had been quiescent at the clarendon home notwithstanding the doctors continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on the dogs condition shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening but for the moment there was a lull georgina was relieved to get daltons message and learn that he was close at hand and sent back word that she would call him when necessity arose amidst all the gathering tension some faint compensating element seemed manifest and georgina finally decided that it was the absence of the lean thibetans whose stealthy sinuous ways and disturbing exotic aspect had always annoyed her they had vanished all at once and old margarita the sole visible servant left in the house told her they were helping their master and surama at the clinicthe following morningthe twentyeighth of maylong to be rememberedwas dark and lowering and georgina felt the precarious calm wearing thin she did not see her brother at all but knew he was in the clinic hard at work at something despite the lack of specimens he had bewailed she wondered how poor tsanpo was getting along and whether he had really been subjected to any serious inoculation but it must be confessed that she wondered more about dick she longed to know whether surama had done anything for the faithful dog amidst his masters oddly callous indifference suramas apparent solicitude on the night of dicks seizure had impressed her greatly giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she had ever had for the detested clinicman now as the day advanced she found herself thinking more and more of dick till at last her harassed nerves finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the whole horror that lay upon the household could stand the suspense no longerup to that time she had always respected alfreds imperious wish that he be never approached or disturbed at the clinic but as this fateful afternoon advanced her resolution to break through the barrier grew stronger and stronger finally she set out with determined face crossing the yard and entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden structure with the fixed intention of discovering how the dog was or of knowing the reason for her brothers secrecythe inner door as usual was locked and behind it she heard voices in heated conversation when her knocking brought no response she rattled the knob as loudly as possible but still the voices argued on unheeding they belonged of course to surama and her brother and as she stood there trying to attract attention she could not help catch something of their drift fate had made her for the second time an eavesdropper and once more the matter she overheard seemed likely to tax her mental poise and nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds alfred and surama were plainly quarrelling with increasing violence and the purport of their speech was enough to arouse the wildest fears and confirm the gravest apprehensions georgina shivered as her brothers voice mounted shrilly to dangerous heights of fanatical tensionyou damn youyoure a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me who started all this anyway didihave any idea of your cursed devilgods and elder world didiever in my life think of your damned spaces beyond the stars and your crawling chaos nyarlathotep i was a normal scientific man confound you till i was fool enough to drag you out of the vaults with your devilish atlantean secrets you egged me on and now you want to cut me off you loaf around doing nothing and telling me to go slow when you

but you neednt think you know all my resources how about the nemesis of flame i talked in yemen with an old man who had come back alive from the crimson deserthe had seen irem the city of pillars and had worshipped at the underground shrines of nug and yebi shubnigguraththrough clarendons shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the clinicmanshut up you fool do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any weight with me words and formulaewords and formulaewhat do they all mean to one who has the substance behind them were in a material sphere now and subject to material laws you have your fever i have my revolver youll get no specimens and ill get no fever so long as i have you in front of me with this gun betweenthat was all georgina could hear she felt her senses reeling and staggered out of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering outside air she saw that the crisis had come at last and that help must now arrive quickly if her brother was to be saved from the unknown gulfs of madness and mystery summoning up all her reserve energy she managed to reach the house and get to the library where she scrawled a hasty note for margarita to take to james daltonwhen the old woman had gone georgina had just strength enough to cross to the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semistupor there she lay for what seemed like years conscious only of the fantastic creeping up of the twilight from the lower corners of the great dismal room and plagued by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed with phantasmal halflimned pageantry through her tortured and stifled brain dusk deepened into darkness and still the spell held then a firm tread sounded in the hall and she heard someone enter the room and fumble at the matchsafe her heart almost stopped beating as the gasjets of the chandelier flared up one by one but then she saw that the arrival was her brother relieved to the bottom of her heart that he was still alive she gave vent to an involuntary sigh profound longdrawn and tremulous and lapsed at last into kindly oblivionat the sound of that sigh clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge and was inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of his sister there her face had a deathlike quality that frightened his inmost spirit and he flung himself on his knees by her side awake to a realisation of what her passing away would mean to him long unused to private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth he had lost the physicians instinct of first aid and could only call out her name and chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him then he thought of water and ran to the diningroom for a carafe stumbling about in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors he was some time in finding what he sought but at last he clutched it in shaking hand and hastened back to dash the cold fluid in georginas face the method was crude but effective she stirred sighed a second time and finally opened her eyesyou are alive he cried and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his head maternally she was almost glad she fainted for the circumstance seemed to have dispelled the strange alfred and brought her own brother back to her she sat up slowly and tried to reassure himim all right al just give me a glass of water its a sin to waste it this wayto say nothing of spoiling my waist is that the way to behave every time your sister drops off for a nap you neednt think im going to be sick for i havent time for such nonsensealfreds eyes shewed that her cool commonsense speech had had its effect his brotherly panic dissolved in an instant and instead there came into his face a vague calculating expression as if some marvellous possibility had just dawned upon him as she watched the subtle waves of cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she became less and less certain that her mode of reassurance had been a wise one and before he spoke she found herself shivering at something she could not define a keen medical instinct almost told her that his moment of sanity had passed and that he was now once more the unrestrained fanatic for scientific research there was something morbid in the quick narrowing of his eyes at her casual mention of good health what was he thinking to what unnatural extreme was his passion for experiment about to be pushed wherein lay the special significance of her pure blood and absolutely flawless organic state none of these misgivings however troubled georgina for more than a second and she was quite natural and unsuspicious as she felt her brothers steady fingers at her pulseyoure a bit feverish georgie he said in a precise elaborately restrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyeswhy nonsense im all right she replied one would think you were on the watch for fever patients just for the sake of shewing off your discovery itwouldbe poetic though if you could make your final proof and demonstration by curing your own sisterclarendon started violently and guiltily had she suspected his wish had he muttered anything aloud he looked at her closely and saw that she had no inkling of the truth she smiled up sweetly into his face and patted his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge then he took a small oblong leather case from his vest pocket and taking out a little gold syringe he began fingering it thoughtfully pushing the piston speculatively in and out of the empty cylinderi wonder he began with suave sententiousness whether you would really be willing to help science insomething like that wayif the need arose whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to the cause of medicine as a sort of jephthahs daughter if you knew it meant the absolute perfection and completion of my workgeorgina catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brothers eyes knew at last that her worst fears were true there was nothing to do now but keep him quiet at all hazards and to pray that margarita had found james dalton at his clubyou look tired al dear she said gently why not take a little morphia and get some of the sleep you need so badlyhe replied with a kind of crafty deliberationyes youre right im worn out and so are you each of us needs a good sleep morphine is just the thingwait till i go and fill the syringe and well both take a proper dosestill fingering the empty syringe he walked softly out of the room georgina looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation ears alert for any sign of possible help she thought she heard margarita again in the basement kitchen and rose to ring the bell in an effort to learn of the fate of her message the old servant answered her summons at once and declared she had given the message at the club hours ago governor dalton had been out but the clerk had promised to deliver the note at the very moment of his arrivalmargarita waddled below stairs again but still clarendon did not reappear what was he doing what was he planning she had heard the outer door slam so knew he must be at the clinic had he forgotten his original intention with the vacillating mind of madness the suspense grew almost unbearable and georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid screamingit was the gate bell which rang simultaneously in house and clinic that broke the tension at last she heard the catlike tread of surama on the walk as he left the clinic to answer it and then with an almost hysterical sigh of relief she caught the firm familiar accents of dalton in conversation with the sinister attendant rising she almost tottered to meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway and for a moment no word was spoken while he kissed her hand in his courtly oldschool fashion then georgina burst forth into a torrent of hurried explanation telling all that had happened all she had glimpsed and overheard and all she feared and suspecteddalton listened gravely and comprehendingly his first bewilderment gradually giving place to astonishment sympathy and resolution the message held by a careless clerk had been slightly delayed and had found him appropriately enough in the midst of a warm loungingroom discussion about clarendon a fellowmember dr macneil had brought in a medical journal with an article well calculated to disturb the devoted scientist and dalton had just asked to keep the paper for future reference when the message was handed him at last abandoning his halfformed plan to take dr macneil into his confidence regarding alfred he called at once for his hat and stick and lost not a moment in getting a cab for the clarendon homesurama he thought appeared alarmed at recognising him though he had chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic dalton always recalled suramas stride and chuckle on this ominous night for he was never to see the unearthly creature again as the chuckler entered the clinic vestibule his deep guttural gurgles seemed to blend with some low mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizonwhen dalton had heard all georgina had to say and learned that alfred was expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine he decided he had better talk with the doctor alone advising georgina to retire to her room and await developments he walked about the gloomy library scanning the shelves and listening for clarendons nervous footstep on the clinic path outside the vast rooms corners were dismal despite the chandelier and the closer dalton looked at his friends choice of books the less he liked them it was not the balanced collection of a normal physician biologist or man of general culture there were too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes dark speculations and forbidden rituals of the middle ages and strange exotic mysteries in alien alphabets both known and unknownthe great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome too the handwriting had a neurotic cast and the spirit of the entries was far from reassuring long passages were inscribed in crabbed greek characters and as dalton marshalled his linguistic memory for their translation he gave a sudden start and wished his college struggles with xenophon and homer had been more conscientious there was something wrongsomething hideously wronghere and the governor sank limply into the chair by the table as he pored more and more closely over the doctors barbarous greek then a sound came startlingly near and he jumped nervously at a hand laid sharply on his shoulderwhat may i ask is the cause of this intrusion you might have stated your business to suramaclarendon was standing icily by the chair the little gold syringe in one hand he seemed very calm and rational and dalton fancied for a moment that georgina must have exaggerated his condition how too could a rusty scholar be absolutely sure about these greek entries the governor decided to be very cautious in his interview and thanked the lucky chance which had placed a specious pretext in his coat pocket he was very cool and assured as he rose to replyi didnt think youd care to have things dragged before a subordinate but i thought you ought to see this article at oncehe drew forth the magazine given him by dr macneil and handed it to clarendonon page 542you see the heading black fever conquered by new serum its by dr miller of philadelphiaand he thinks hes got ahead of you with your cure they were discussing it at the club and macneil thought the exposition very convincing i as a layman couldnt pretend to judge but at all events i thought you oughtnt to miss a chance to digest the thing while its fresh if youre busy of course i wont disturb youclarendon cut in sharplyim going to give my sister an hypodermicshes not quite wellbut ill look at what that quack has to say when i get back i know millera damn sneak and incompetentand i dont believe he has the brains to steal my methods from the little hes seen of themdalton suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that georgina must not receive that intended dose there was something sinister about it from what she had said alfred must have been inordinately long preparing it far longer than was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet he decided to hold his host as long as possible meanwhile testing his attitude in a more or less subtle wayim sorry georgina isnt well are you sure that the injection will do her good that it wont do her any harmclarendons spasmodic start shewed that something had been struck homedo her harm he cried dont be absurd you know georgina must be in the best of healththe very best i sayin order to serve science as a clarendon should serve it she at least appreciates the fact that she is my sister she deems no sacrifice too great in my service she is a priestess of truth and discovery as i am a priesthe paused in his shrill tirade wildeyed and somewhat out of breath dalton could see that his attention had been momentarily shiftedbut let me see what this cursed quack has to say he continued if he thinks his pseudomedical rhetoric can take a real doctor in he is even simpler than i thoughtclarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood there clutching his syringe dalton wondered what the real facts were macneil had assured him that the author was a pathologist of the highest standing and that whatever errors the article might have the mind behind it was powerful erudite and absolutely honourable and sincerewatching the doctor as he read dalton saw the thin bearded face grow pale the great eyes blazed and the pages crackled in the tenser grip of the long lean fingers a perspiration broke out on the high ivorywhite forehead where the hair was already thinning and the reader sank gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept on with his devouring of the text then came a wild scream as from a haunted beast and clarendon lurched forward on the table his outflung arms sweeping books and paper before them as consciousness went dark like a windquenched candleflamedalton springing to help his stricken friend raised the slim form and tilted it back in the chair seeing the carafe on the floor near the lounge he dashed some water into the twisted face and was rewarded by seeing the large eyes slowly open they were sane eyes nowdeep and sad and unmistakably saneand dalton felt awed in the presence of a tragedy whose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumbthe golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand and as clarendon drew a deep shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and studied the glittering thing that rolled about on his palm then he spokeslowly and with the ineffable sadness of utter absolute despairthanks jimmy im quite all right but theres much to be done you asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do georgie any harm im in a position now to tell you that it wonthe turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston at the same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own neck dalton cried out in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand injected the contents of the cylinder into the ridge of distended fleshgood lord al what have you doneclarendon smiled gentlya smile almost of peace and resignation different indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeksyou ought to know jimmy if youve still the judgment that made you a governor you must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise that theres nothing else to do with your marks in greek back at columbia i guess you couldnt have missed much all i can say is that its truejames i dont like to pass blame along but its only right to tell you that surama got me into this i cant tell you who or what he is for i dont fully know myself and what i do know is stuff that no sane person ought to know but i will say that i dont consider him a human being in the fullest sense and that im not sure whether or not hes alive as we know lifeyou think im talking nonsense i wish i were but the whole hideous mess is damnably real i started out in life with a clean mind and purpose i wanted to rid the world of fever i tried and failedand i wish to god i had been honest enough to say that id failed dont let my old talk of science deceive you jamesi found no antitoxin and was never even half on the track of onedont look so shaken up old fellow a veteran politicianfighter like you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before i tell you i never had even the start of a fever cure but my studies had taken me into some queer places and it was just my damned luck to listen to the stories of some still queerer people james if you ever wish any man well tell him to keep clear of the ancient hidden places of the earth old backwaters are dangerousthings are handed down there that dont do healthy people any good i talked too much with old priests and mystics and got to hoping i might achieve things in dark ways that i couldnt achieve in lawful waysi shant tell you just what i mean for if i did id be as bad as the old priests that were the ruin of me all i need say is that after what ive learned i shudder at the thought of the world and what its been through the world is cursed old james and there have been whole chapters lived and closed before the dawn of our organic life and the geologic eras connected with it its an awful thoughtwhole forgotten cycles of evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseasesall lived through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the tropic seas geology tells us abouti said gone but i didnt quite mean that it would have been better that way but it wasnt quite so in places traditions have kept oni cant tell you howand certain archaic lifeforms have managed to struggle thinly down the aeons in hidden spots there were cults you knowbands of evil priests in lands now buried under the sea atlantis was the hotbed that was a terrible place if heaven is merciful no one will ever drag up that horror from the deepit had a colony though that didnt sink and when you get too confidential with one of the tuareg priests in africa hes likely to tell you wild tales about ittales that connect up with whispers youll hear among the mad lamas and flighty yakdrivers on the secret tablelands of asia id heard all the common tales and whispers when i came on the big one what that was youll never knowbut it pertained to somebody or something that had come down from a blasphemously long time ago and could be made to live againor seem alive againthrough certain processes that werent very clear to the man who told menow james in spite of my confession about the fever you know im not bad as a doctor i plugged hard at medicine and soaked up about as much as the next manmaybe a little more because down there in the hoggar country i did something no priest had ever been able to do they led me blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for generationsand i came back with suramaeasy james i know what you want to say how does he know all he knowswhy does he speak englishor any other language for that matterwithout an accentwhy did he come away with meand all that i cant tell you altogether but i can say that he takes in ideas and images and impressions with something besides his brain and senses he had a use for me and my science he told me things and opened up vistas he taught me to worship ancient primordial and unholy gods and mapped out a road to a terrible goal which i cant even hint to you dont press me jamesits for the sake of your sanity and the worlds sanitythe creature is beyond all bounds hes in league with the stars and all the forces of nature dont think im still crazy jamesi swear to you im not ive had too many glimpses to doubt he gave me new pleasures that were forms of his palaeogean worship and the greatest of those was the black fevergod james havent you seen through the business by this time do you still believe the black fever came out of thibet and that i learned about it there use your brains man look at millers article here hes found a basic antitoxin that will end all fever within half a century when other men learn how to modify it for the different forms hes cut the ground of my youth from under medone what id have given my life to dotaken the wind out of all the honest sails i ever flung to the breeze of science do you wonder his article gave me a turn do you wonder it shocks me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my youth too late too late but not too late to save othersi guess im rambling a bit now old man you knowthe hypodermic i asked you why you didnt tumble to the facts about black fever how could you though doesnt miller say hes cured seven cases with his serum a matter of diagnosis james he only thinks it is black fever i can read between his lines here old chap on page 551 is the key to the whole thing read it againyou see dont you the fever casesfrom the pacific coastdidnt respond to his serum they puzzled him they didnt even seem like any true fever he knew well those weremycases those were therealblack fever cases and there cant ever be an antitoxin on earth thatll cure black feverhow do i knowbecause black fever isnt of this earthits fromsomewhere elsejamesand surama alone knows where because he brought it here hebrought it and i spread itthats the secret james thats all i wanted the appointment forthats all i ever didjust spread the fever that i carried in this gold syringe and in the deadlier fingerringpumpsyringe you see on my index fingerscience a blind i wanted to kill and kill and kill a single pressure on my finger and the black fever was inoculated i wanted to see living things writhe and squirm scream and froth at the mouth a single pressure of the pumpsyringe and i could watch them as they died and i couldnt live or think unless i had plenty to watch thats why i jabbed everything in sight with the accursed hollow needle animals criminals children servantsand the next would have beenclarendons voice broke and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chairthatthat jameswasmy life surama made it sohe taught me and kept me at it till i couldnt stop thenthen it got too mucheven for himhe tried to check me fancyhetrying to check anybody in that line but now ive got my last specimen that is my last test good subject jamesim healthydevilish healthy deuced ironic thoughthe madness has gone now so there wont be any fun watching the agony cant becanta violent shiver of fever racked the doctor and dalton mourned amidst his horrorstupefaction that he could give no grief how much of alfreds story was sheer nonsense and how much nightmare truth he could not say but in any case he felt that the man was a victim rather than a criminal and above all he was a boyhood comrade and georginas brother thoughts of the old days came back kaleidoscopically little alfthe yard at phillips exeterthe quadrangle at columbiathe fight with tom cortland when he saved alf from a pommeling he helped clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do there was nothing alfred could only whisper now but he asked forgiveness for all his offences and commended his sister to the care of his friendyouyoullmake her happy he gasped she deserves it martyrtoa myth make it up to her james dontletherknowmorethan she has tohis voice trailed off in a mumble and he fell into a stupor dalton rang the bell but margarita had gone to bed so he called up the stairs for georgina she was firm of step but very pale alfreds scream had tried her sorely but she had trusted james she trusted him still as he shewed her the unconscious form on the lounge and asked her to go back to her room and rest no matter what sounds she might hear he did not wish her to witness the awful spectacle of delirium certain to come but bade her kiss her brother a final farewell as he lay there calm and still very like the delicate boy he had once been so she left himthe strange moonstruck starreading genius she had mothered so longand the picture she carried away was a very merciful onedalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture his fears of delirium were not vain and all through the black midnight hours his giant strength restrained the frenzied contortions of the mad sufferer what he heard from those swollen blackening lips he will never repeat he has never been quite the same man since and he knows that no one who hears such things can ever be wholly as he was before so for the worlds good he dares not speak and he thanks god that his laymans ignorance of certain subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic and meaningless to himtoward morning clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and began to speak in a firm voicejames i didnt tell you what must be doneabout everything blot out these entries in greek and send my notebook to dr miller all my other notes too that youll find in the files hes the big authority todayhis article proves it your friend at the club was rightbut everything in the clinic must goeverything without exception dead or alive orotherwiseall the plagues of hell are in those bottles on the shelves burn themburn it allif one thing escapes surama will spread black death throughout the worldand above all burn suramathatthatthingmust not breathe the wholesome air of heaven you know nowwhat i told youyou know why such an entity cant be allowed on earth it wont be murdersurama isnt humanif youre as pious as you used to be james i shant have to urge you remember the old textthou shalt not suffer a witch to liveor something of the sortburn him jamesdont let him chuckle again over the torture of mortal flesh i sayburn himthe nemesis of flamethats all that can reach him james unless you can catch him asleep and drive a stake through his heart kill himextirpate himcleanse the decent universe of its primal taintthe taint i recalled from its agelong sleep the doctor had risen on his elbow and his voice was a piercing shriek toward the last the effort was too much however and he lapsed very suddenly into a deep tranquil coma dalton himself fearless of fever since he knew the dread germ to be noncontagious composed alfreds arms and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragile form after all mightnt much of this horror be exaggeration and delirium mightnt old doc macneil pull him through on a long chance the governor strove to keep awake and walked briskly up and down the room but his energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures a seconds rest in the chair by the table took matters out of his hands and he was presently sleeping soundly despite his best intentionsdalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes and for a moment he thought the dawn had come but it was not the dawn and as he rubbed his heavy lids he saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in the yard whose stout planks flamed and roared and crackled heavenward in the most stupendous holocaust he had ever seen it was indeed the nemesis of flame that clarendon had wished and dalton felt that some strange combustibles must be involved in a blaze so much wilder than anything normal pine or redwood could afford he glanced alarmedly at the lounge but alfred was not there starting up he went to call georgina but met her in the hall roused as he was by the mountain of living firethe clinics burning down she cried how is al nowhes disappeareddisappeared while i dropped asleep replied dalton reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to swaygently leading her upstairs toward her room he promised to search at once for alfred but georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from outside cast a weird glow through the window on the landinghe must be dead jameshe could never live sane and knowing what he did i heard him quarrelling with surama and know that awful things were going on he is my brother butit is best as it isher voice had sunk to a whispersuddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep hideous chuckle and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till they half resembled some nameless cyclopean creatures of nightmare james and georgina paused hesitant and peered out breathlessly through the landing window then from the sky came a thunderous peal as a forked bolt of lightning shot down with terrible directness into the very midst of the blazing ruin the deep chuckle ceased and in its place came a frantic ululant yelp as of a thousand ghouls and werewolves in torment it died away with long reverberant echoes and slowly the flames resumed their normal shapethe watchers did not move but waited till the pillar of fire had shrunk to a smouldering glow they were glad of a halfrusticity which had kept the firemen from trooping out and of the wall that excluded the curious what had happened was not for vulgar eyesit involved too much of the universes inner secrets for thatin the pale dawn james spoke softly to georgina who could do no more than put her head on his breast and sobsweetheart i think he has atoned he must have set the fire you know while i was asleep he told me it ought to be burnedthe clinic and everything in it surama too it was the only way to save the world from the unknown horrors he had loosed upon it he knew and he did what was besthe was a great man georgie lets never forget that we must always be proud of him for he started out to help mankind and was titanic even in his sins ill tell you more sometime what he did be it good or evil was what no man ever did before he was the first and last to break through certain veils and even apollonius of tyana takes second place beside him but we mustnt talk about that we must remember him only as the little alf we knewas the boy who wanted to master medicine and conquer feverin the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found two skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adheringonly two thanks to the undisturbed limepits one was of a man the other is still a subject of debate among the biologists of the coast it was not exactly an apes or a saurians skeleton but it had disturbing suggestions of lines of evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace the charred skull oddly enough was very human and reminded people of surama but the rest of the bones were beyond conjecture only wellcut clothing could have made such a body look like a manbut the human bones were clarendons no one disputed this and the world at large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor of his age the bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have far eclipsed dr millers kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to perfection much of millers late success indeed is credited to the notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames of the old rivalry and hatred almost none survived and even dr wilfred jones has been known to boast of his association with the vanished leaderjames dalton and his wife georgina have always preserved a reticence which modesty and family grief might well account for they published certain notes as a tribute to the great mans memory but have never confirmed or contradicted either the popular estimate or the rare hints of marvels that a very few keen thinkers have been known to whisper it was very subtly and slowly that the facts filtered out dalton probably gave dr macneil an inkling of the truth and that good soul had not many secrets from his sonthe daltons have led on the whole a very happy life for their cloud of terror lies far in the background and a strong mutual love has kept the world fresh for them but there are things which disturb them oddlylittle things of which one would scarcely ever think of complaining they cannot bear persons who are lean or deepvoiced beyond certain limits and georgina turns pale at the sound of any guttural chuckling senator dalton has a mixed horror of occultism travel hypodermics and strange alphabets which most find hard to unify and there are still those who blame him for the vast proportion of the doctors library that he destroyed with such painstaking completenessmacneil though seemed to realise he was a simple man and he said a prayer as the last of alfred clarendons strange books crumbled to ashes nor would anyone who had peered understandingly within those books wish a word of that prayer unsaid,1

it is midnight before dawn they will find me and take me to a black cell where i shall languish interminably while insatiable desires gnaw at my vitals and wither up my heart till at last i become one with the dead that i lovemy seat is the foetid hollow of an aged grave my desk is the back of a fallen tombstone worn smooth by devastating centuries my only light is that of the stars and a thinedged moon yet i can see as clearly as though it were midday around me on every side sepulchral sentinels guarding unkempt graves the tilting decrepit headstones lie halfhidden in masses of nauseous rotting vegetation above the rest silhouetted against the livid sky an august monument lifts its austere tapering spire like the spectral chieftain of a lemurian horde the air is heavy with the noxious odors of fungi and the scent of damp mouldy earth but to me it is the aroma of elysium it is stillterrifyingly stillwith a silence whose very profundity bespeaks the solemn and the hideous could i choose my habitation it would be in the heart of some such city of putrefying flesh and crumbling bones for their nearness sends ecstatic thrills through my soul causing the stagnant blood to race through my veins and my torpid heart to pound with delirious joyfor the presence of death is life to memy early childhood was one long prosaic and monotonous apathy strictly ascetic wan pallid undersized and subject to protracted spells of morbid moroseness i was ostracized by the healthy normal youngsters of my own age they dubbed me a spoilsport an old woman because i had no interest in the rough childish games they played or any stamina to participate in them had i so desiredlike all rural villages fenham had its quota of poisontongued gossips their prying imaginations hailed my lethargic temperament as some abhorrent abnormality they compared me with my parents and shook their heads in ominous doubt at the vast difference some of the more superstitious openly pronounced me a changeling while others who knew something of my ancestry called attention to the vague mysterious rumors concerning a greatgreatgrand uncle who had been burned at the stake as a necromancerhad i lived in some larger town with greater opportunities for congenial companionship perhaps i could have overcome this early tendency to be a recluse as i reached my teens i grew even more sullen morbid and apathetic my life lacked motivation i seemed in the grip of something that dulled my senses stunted my development retarded my activities and left me unaccountably dissatisfiedi was sixteen when i attended my first funeral a funeral in fenham was a preeminent social event for our town was noted for the longevity of its inhabitants when moreover the funeral was that of such a wellknown character as my grandfather it was safe to assume that the townspeople would turn out en masse to pay due homage to his memory yet i did not view the approaching ceremony with even latent interest anything that tended to lift me out of my habitual inertia held for me only the promise of physical and mental disquietude in deference to my parents importunings mainly to give myself relief from their caustic condemnations of what they chose to call my unfilial attitude i agreed to accompany themthere was nothing out of the ordinary about my grandfathers funeral unless it was the voluminous array of floral tributes but this remember was my initiation to the solemn rites of such an occasion something about the darkened room the oblong coffin with its somber drapings the banked masses of fragrant blooms the dolorous manifestations of the assembled villagers stirred me from my normal listlessness and arrested my attention roused from my momentary reverie by a nudge from my mothers sharp elbow i followed her across the room to the casket where the body of my grandparent layfor the first time i was face to face with death i looked down upon the calm placid face lined with its multitudinous wrinkles and saw nothing to cause so much of sorrow instead it seemed to me that grandfather was immeasurably content blandly satisfied i felt swayed by some strange discordant sense of elation so slowly so stealthily had it crept over me that i could scarcely define its coming as i mentally review that portentous hour it seems that it must have originated with my first glimpse of that funeral scene silently strengthening its grip with subtle insidiousness a baleful malignant influence that seemed to emanate from the corpse itself held me with magnetic fascination my whole being seemed charged with some ecstatic electrifying force and i felt my form straighten without conscious volition my eyes were trying to burn beneath the closed lids of the dead mans and read some secret message they concealed my heart gave a sudden leap of unholy glee and pounded against my ribs with demoniacal force as if to free itself from the confining walls of my frail frame wild wanton soulsatisfying sensuality engulfed me once more the vigorous prod of a maternal elbow jarred me into activity i had made my way to the sableshrouded coffin with leaden tread i walked away with newfound animationi accompanied the cortege to the cemetery my whole physical being permeated with this mystic enlivening influence it was as if i had quaffed deep draughts of some exotic elixirsome abominable concoction brewed from blasphemous formulae in the archives of belialthe townsfolk were so intent upon the ceremony that the radical change in my demeanor passed unnoticed by all save my father and my mother but in the fortnight that followed the village busybodies found fresh material for their vitriolic tongues in my altered bearing at the end of the fortnight however the potency of the stimulus began to lose its effectiveness another day or two and i had completely reverted to my oldtime languor though not to the complete and engulfing insipidity of the past before there had been an utter lack of desire to emerge from the enervation now vague and indefinable unrest disturbed me outwardly i had become myself again and the scandalmongers turned to some more engrossing subject had they even so much as dreamed the true cause of my exhilaration they would have shunned me as if i were a filthy leprous thing had i visioned the execrable power behind my brief period of elation i would have locked myself forever from the rest of the world and spent my remaining years in penitent solitudetragedy often runs in trilogies hence despite the proverbial longevity of our townspeople the next five years brought the death of both parents my mother went first in an accident of the most unexpected nature and so genuine was my grief that i was honestly surprised to find its poignancy mocked and contradicted by that almost forgotten feeling of supreme and diabolical ecstasy once more my heart leaped wildly within me once more it pounded at triphammer speed and sent the hot blood coursing through my veins with meteoric fervor i shook from my shoulders the harassing cloak of stagnation only to replace it with the infinitely more horrible burden of loathsome unhallowed desire i haunted the deathchamber where the body of my mother lay my soul athirst for the devilish nectar that seemed to saturate the air of the darkened room every breath strengthened me lifted me to towering heights of seraphic satisfaction i knew now that it was but a sort of drugged delirium which must soon pass and leave me correspondingly weakened by its malign power yet i could no more control my longing than i could untwist the gordian knots in the already tangled skein of my destinyi knew too that through some strange satanic curse my life depended upon the dead for its motive force that there was a singularity in my makeup which responded only to the awesome presence of some lifeless clod a few days later frantic for the bestial intoxicant on which the fullness of my existence depended i interviewed fenhams sole undertaker and talked him into taking me on as a sort of apprenticethe shock of my mothers demise had visibly affected my father i think that if i had broached the idea of such outr employment at any other time he would have been emphatic in his refusal as it was he nodded acquiescence after a moments sober thought how little did i dream that he would be the object of my first practical lessonhe too died suddenly developing some hitherto unsuspected heart affliction my octogenarian employer tried his best to dissuade me from the unthinkable task of embalming his body nor did he detect the rapturous glint in my eyes as i finally won him over to my damnable point of view i cannot hope to express the reprehensible the unutterable thoughts that swept in tumultuous waves of passion through my racing heart as i labored over the lifeless clay unsurpassed love was the keynote of these concepts a love greaterfar greaterthan any i had ever borne him while he was alivemy father was not a rich man but he had possessed enough of worldly goods to make him comfortably independent as his sole heir i found myself in rather a paradoxical position my early youth had totally failed to fit me for contact with the modern world yet the primitive life of fenham with its attendant isolation palled upon me indeed the longevity of the inhabitants defeated my sole motive in arranging my indentureafter settling the estate it proved an easy matter to secure my release and i headed for bayboro a city some fifty miles away here my year of apprenticeship stood me in good stead i had no trouble in establishing a favorable connection as an assistant with the gresham corporation a concern that maintained the largest funeral parlors in the city i even prevailed upon them to let me sleep upon the premisesfor already the proximity of the dead was becoming an obsessioni applied myself to my task with unwonted zeal no case was too gruesome for my impious sensibilities and i soon became master at my chosen vocation every fresh corpse brought into the establishment meant a fulfilled promise of ungodly gladness of irreverent gratification a return of that rapturous tumult of the arteries which transformed my grisly task into one of beloved devotionyet every carnal satiation exacted its toll i came to dread the days that brought no dead for me to gloat over and prayed to all the obscene gods of the nethermost abysses to bring swift sure death upon the residents of the citythen came the nights when a skulking figure stole surreptitiously through the shadowy streets of the suburbs pitchdark nights when the midnight moon was obscured by heavy lowering clouds it was a furtive figure that blended with the trees and cast fugitive glances over its shoulder a figure bent on some malignant mission after one of these prowlings the morning papers would scream to their sensationmad clientele the details of some nightmare crime column on column of lurid gloating over abominable atrocities paragraph on paragraph of impossible solutions and extravagant conflicting suspicions through it all i felt a supreme sense of security for who would for a moment suspect an employee in an undertaking establishment where death was supposedly an everyday affair of seeking surcease from unnamable urgings in the coldblooded slaughter of his fellowbeings i planned each crime with maniacal cunning varying the manner of my murders so that no one would even dream that all were the work of one bloodstained pair of hands the aftermath of each nocturnal venture was an ecstatic hour of pleasure pernicious and unalloyed a pleasure always heightened by the chance that its delicious source might later be assigned to my gloating administrations in the course of my regular occupation sometimes that double and ultimate pleasure did occuro rare and delicious memoryduring long nights when i clung to the shelter of my sanctuary i was prompted by the mausolean silence to devise new and unspeakable ways of lavishing my affections upon the dead that i lovedthe dead that gave me lifeone morning mr gresham came much earlier than usualcame to find me stretched out upon a cold slab deep in ghoulish slumber my arms wrapped about the stark stiff naked body of a foetid corpse he roused me from my salacious dreams his eyes filled with mingled detestation and pity gently but firmly he told me that i must go that my nerves were unstrung that i needed a long rest from the repellent tasks my vocation required that my impressionable youth was too deeply affected by the dismal atmosphere of my environment how little did he know of the demoniacal desires that spurred me on in my disgusting infirmities i was wise enough to see that argument would only strengthen his belief in my potential madnessit was far better to leave than to invite discovery of the motive underlying my actionsafter this i dared not stay long in one place for fear some overt act would bare my secret to an unsympathetic world i drifted from city to city from town to town i worked in morgues around cemeteries once in a crematoryanywhere that afforded me an opportunity to be near the dead that i so cravedthen came the world war i was one of the first to go across one of the last to return four years of bloodred charnel hell sickening slime of rainrotten trenches deafening bursting of hysterical shells monotonous droning of sardonic bullets smoking frenzies of phlegethons fountains stifling fumes of murderous gases grotesque remnants of smashed and shredded bodies four years of transcendent satisfactionin every wanderer there is a latent urge to return to the scenes of his childhood a few months later found me making my way through the familiar byways of fenham vacant dilapidated farm houses lined the adjacent roadsides while the years had brought equal retrogression to the town itself a mere handful of the houses were occupied but among these was the one i had once called home the tangled weedchoked driveway the broken window panes the uncaredfor acres that stretched behind all bore mute confirmation of the tales that guarded inquiries had elicitedthat it now sheltered a dissolute drunkard who eked out a meager existence from the chores his few neighbors gave him out of sympathy for the mistreated wife and undernourished child who shared his lot all in all the glamour surrounding my youthful environment was entirely dispelled so prompted by some errant foolhardy thought i next turned my steps toward bayborohere too the years had brought changes but in reverse order the small city i remembered had almost doubled in size despite its wartime depopulation instinctively i sought my former place of employment finding it still there but with an unfamiliar name and successor to above the door for the influenza epidemic had claimed mr gresham while the boys were overseas some fateful mood impelled me to ask for work i referred to my tutelage under mr gresham with some trepidation but my fears were groundlessmy late employer had carried the secret of my unethical conduct with him to the grave an opportune vacancy insured my immediate reinstallationthen came vagrant haunting memories of scarlet nights of impious pilgrimages and an uncontrollable desire to renew those illicit joys i cast caution to the winds and launched upon another series of damnable debaucheries once more the yellow sheets found welcome material in the devilish details of my crimes comparing them to the red weeks of horror that had appalled the city years before once more the police sent out their dragnet and drew into its enmeshing foldsnothingmy thirst for the noxious nectar of the dead grew to a consuming fire and i began to shorten the periods between my odious exploits i realized that i was treading on dangerous ground but demoniac desire gripped me in its torturing tentacles and urged me onall this time my mind was becoming more and more benumbed to any influence except the satiation of my insane longings little details vitally important to one bent on such evil escapades escaped me somehow somewhere i left a vague trace an elusive clue behindnot enough to warrant my arrest but sufficient to turn the tide of suspicion in my direction i sensed this espionage yet was helpless to stem the surging demand for more dead to quicken my enervated soulthen came the night when the shrill whistle of the police roused me from my fiendish gloating over the body of my latest victim a gory razor still clutched tightly in my hand with one dexterous motion i closed the blade and thrust it into the pocket of the coat i wore nightsticks beat a lusty tattoo upon the door i crashed the window with a chair thanking fate i had chosen one of the cheaper tenement districts for my locale i dropped into a dingy alley as bluecoated forms burst through the shattered door over shaky fences through filthy back yards past squalid ramshackle houses down dimly lighted narrow streets i fled i thought at once of the wooded marshes that lay beyond the city and stretched for half a hundred miles till they touched the outskirts of fenham if i could reach this goal i would be temporarily safe before dawn i was plunging headlong through the foreboding wasteland stumbling over the rotting roots of halfdead trees whose naked branches stretched out like grotesque arms striving to encumber me with mocking embracesthe imps of the nefarious gods to whom i offered my idolatrous prayers must have guided my footsteps through that menacing morass a week later wan bedraggled and emaciated i lurked in the woods a mile from fenham so far i had eluded my pursuers yet i dared not show myself for i knew that the alarm must have been sent broadcast i vaguely hoped i had thrown them off the trail after that first frenetic night i had heard no sound of alien voices no crashing of heavy bodies through the underbrush perhaps they had concluded that my body lay hidden in some stagnant pool or had vanished forever in the tenacious quagmirehunger gnawed at my vitals with poignant pangs thirst left my throat parched and dry yet far worse was the unbearable hunger of my starving soul for the stimulus i found only in the nearness of the dead my nostrils quivered in sweet recollection no longer could i delude myself with the thought that this desire was a mere whim of the heated imagination i knew now that it was an integral part of life itself that without it i should burn out like an empty lamp i summoned all my remaining energy to fit me for the task of satisfying my accursed appetite despite the peril attending my move i set out to reconnoiter skirting the sheltering shadows like an obscene wraith once more i felt that strange sensation of being led by some unseen satellite of satan yet even my sinsteeped soul revolted for a moment when i found myself before my native abode the scene of my youthful hermitagethen these disquieting memories faded in their place came overwhelming lustful desire behind the rotting walls of this old house lay my prey a moment later i had raised one of the shattered windows and climbed over the sill i listened for a moment every sense alert every muscle tensed for action the silence reassured me with catlike tread i stole through the familiar rooms until stertorous snores indicated the place where i was to find surcease from my sufferings i allowed myself a sigh of anticipatory ecstasy as i pushed open the door of the bedchamber pantherlike i made my way to the supine form stretched out in drunken stupor the wife and childwhere were theywell they could wait my clutching fingers groped for his throat hours later i was again the fugitive but a newfound stolen strength was mine three silent forms slept to wake no more it was not until the garish light of day penetrated my hidingplace that i visualized the certain consequences of my rashly purchased relief by this time the bodies must have been discovered even the most obtuse of the rural police must surely link the tragedy with my flight from the nearby city besides for the first time i had been careless enough to leave some tangible proof of my identitymy fingerprints on the throats of the newly dead all day i shivered in nervous apprehension the mere crackling of a dry twig beneath my feet conjured mental images that appalled me that night under cover of the protecting darkness i skirted fenham and made for the woods that lay beyond before dawn came the first definite hint of renewed pursuitthe distant baying of houndsthrough the long night i pressed on but by morning i could feel my artificial strength ebbing noon brought once more the insistent call of the contaminating curse and i knew i must fall by the way unless i could once more experience that exotic intoxication that came only with the proximity of the loved dead i had traveled in a wide semicircle if i pushed steadily ahead midnight would bring me to the cemetery where i had laid away my parents years before my only hope i felt certain lay in reaching this goal before i was overtaken with a silent prayer to the devils that dominated my destiny i turned leaden feet in the direction of my last strongholdgod can it be that a scant twelve hours have passed since i started for my ghostly sanctuary i have lived an eternity in each leaden hour but i have reached a rich reward the noxious odors of this neglected spot are frankincense to my suffering soulthe first streaks of dawn are graying the horizon they are coming my sharp ears catch the faroff howling of the dogs it is but a matter of minutes before they find me and shut me away forever from the rest of the world to spend my days in ravaging yearnings till at last i join the dead i lovethey shall not take me a way of escape is open a cowards choice perhaps but betterfar betterthan endless months of nameless misery i will leave this record behind me that some soul may perhaps understand why i make this choicethe razor it has nestled forgotten in my pocket since my flight from bayboro its bloodstained blade gleams oddly in the waning light of the thinedged moon one slashing stroke across my left wrist and deliverance is assured warm fresh blood spatters grotesque patterns on dingy decrepit slabs phantasmal hordes swarm over the rotting graves spectral fingers beckon me ethereal fragments of unwritten melodies rise in celestial crescendo distant stars dance drunkenly in demoniac accompaniment a thousand tiny hammers beat hideous dissonances on anvils inside my chaotic brain gray ghosts of slaughtered spirits parade in mocking silence before me scorching tongues of invisible flame sear the

i the shadow on the chimneythere was thunder in the air on the night i went to the deserted mansion atop tempest mountain to find the lurking fear i was not alone for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life with me were two faithful and muscular men for whom i had sent when the time came men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitnesswe had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month beforethe nightmare creeping death later i thought they might aid me but i did not want them then would to god i had let them share the search that i might not have had to bear the secret alone so long to bear it alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the daemon implications of the thing now that i am telling it anyway lest the brooding make me a maniac i wish i had never concealed it for i and i only know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountainin a small motorcar we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill until the wooded ascent checked it the country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed crowds of investigators so that we were often tempted to use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract it was not a wholesome landscape after dark and i believe i would have noticed its morbidity even had i been ignorant of the terror that stalked there of wild creatures there were nonethey are wise when death leers close the ancient lightningscarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted and the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy fulguritepitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead mens skulls swelled to gigantic proportionsfear had lurked on tempest mountain for more than a century this i learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the worlds notice the place is a remote lonely elevation in that part of the catskills where dutch civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it the fear however is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade handwoven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot raise or makethe lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted martense mansion which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of tempest mountain for over a hundred years the antique grovecircled stone house had been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous stories of a silent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer with whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment while sometimes they whispered of bloodtrails toward the distant mansion some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation while others said the thunder was its voiceno one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories with their incoherent extravagant descriptions of the halfglimpsed fiend yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted local history forbade such a doubt although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters grandmothers told strange myths of the martense spectre myths concerning the martense family itself its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes its long unnatural annals and the murder which had cursed itthe terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers wildest legends one summer night after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create the pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had descended upon them and they were not doubted they had not seen it but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had comein the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come death was indeed there the ground under one of the squatters villages had caved in after a lightning stroke destroying several of the malodorous shanties but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which paled it to insignificance of a possible 75 natives who had inhabited this spot not one living specimen was visible the disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of daemon teeth and talons yet no visible trail led away from the carnage that some hideous animal must be the cause everyone quickly agreed nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent communities that charge was revived only when about 25 of the estimated population were found missing from the dead and even then it was hard to explain the murder of fifty by half that number but the fact remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled chewed and clawedthe excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted martense mansion though the localities were over three miles apart the troopers were more sceptical including the mansion only casually in their investigations and dropping it altogether when they found it thoroughly deserted country and village people however canvassed the place with infinite care overturning everything in the house sounding ponds and brooks beating down bushes and ransacking the nearby forests all was in vain the death that had come had left no trace save destruction itselfby the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the newspapers whose reporters overran tempest mountain they described it in much detail and with many interviews to elucidate the horrors history as told by local grandams i followed the accounts languidly at first for i am a connoisseur in horrors but after a week i detected an atmosphere which stirred me oddly so that on august 5th 1921 i registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at lefferts corners nearest village to tempest mountain and acknowledged headquarters of the searchers three weeks more and the dispersal of the reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the minute inquiries and surveying with which i had meanwhile busied myselfso on this summer night while distant thunder rumbled i left a silent motorcar and tramped with two armed companions up the last moundcovered reaches of tempest mountain casting the beams of an electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through giant oaks ahead in this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination the vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could not uncover yet i did not hesitate since i had come with fierce resolution to test an idea i believed that the thunder called the deathdaemon out of some fearsome secret place and be that daemon solid entity or vaporous pestilence i meant to see iti had thoroughly searched the ruin before hence knew my plan well choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of jan martense whose murder looms so great in the rural legends i felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes the chamber measuring about twenty feet square contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had once been furniture it lay on the second story on the southeast corner of the house and had an immense east window and narrow south window both devoid of panes or shutters opposite the large window was an enormous dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the prodigal son and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wallas the treemuffled thunder grew louder i arranged my plans details first i fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three rope ladders which i had brought with me i knew they reached a suitable spot on the grass outside for i had tested them then the three of us dragged from another room a wide fourposter bedstead crowding it laterally against the window having strown it with fir boughs all now rested on it with drawn automatics two relaxing while the third watched from whatever direction the daemon might come our potential escape was provided if it came from within the house we had the window ladders if from outside the door and the stairs we did not think judging from precedent that it would pursue us far even at worsti watched from midnight to one oclock when in spite of the sinister house the unprotected window and the approaching thunder and lightning i felt singularly drowsy i was between my two companions george bennett being toward the window and william tobey toward the fireplace bennett was asleep having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which affected me so i designated tobey for the next watch although even he was nodding it is curious how intently i had been watching that fireplacethe increasing thunder must have affected my dreams for in the brief time i slept there came to me apocalyptic visions once i partly awaked probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm across my chest i was not sufficiently awake to see whether tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel but felt a distinct anxiety on that score never before had the presence of evil so poignantly oppressed me later i must have dropped asleep again for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imaginationin that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion i awoke to red madness and the mockery of diabolism as farther and farther down inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and reverberated there was no light but i knew from the empty space at my right that tobey was gone god alone knew whither across my chest still lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my leftthen came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole mountain lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove and splintered the patriarch of the twisted trees in the daemon flash of a monstrous fireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond the window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the fireplace from which my eyes had never strayed that i am still alive and sane is a marvel i cannot fathom i cannot fathom it for the shadow on that chimney was not that of george bennett or of any other human creature but a blasphemous abnormality from hells nethermost craters a nameless shapeless abomination which no mind could fully grasp and no pen even partly describe in another second i was alone in the accursed mansion shivering and gibbering george bennett and william tobey had left no trace not even of a struggle they were never heard of againii a passer in the stormfor days after that hideous experience in the forestswathed mansion i lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at lefferts corners i do not remember exactly how i managed to reach the motorcar start it and slip unobserved back to the village for i retain no distinct impression save of wildarmed titan trees daemoniac mutterings of thunder and charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and streaked the regionas i shivered and brooded on the casting of that brainblasting shadow i knew that i had at last pried out one of earths supreme horrorsone of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint daemon scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space yet from which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity the shadow i had seen i hardly dared to analyse or identify something had lain between me and the window that night but i shuddered whenever i could not cast off the instinct to classify it if it had only snarled or bayed or laughed titteringlyeven that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness but it was so silent it had rested a heavy arm or fore leg on my chest obviously it was organic or had once been organic jan martense whose room i had invaded was buried in the graveyard near the mansion i must find bennett and tobey if they lived why had it picked them and left me for the last drowsiness is so stifling and dreams are so horrible in a short time i realised that i must tell my story to someone or break down completely i had already decided not to abandon the quest for the lurking fear for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty was worse than enlightenment however terrible the latter might prove to be accordingly i resolved in my mind the best course to pursue whom to select for my confidences and how to track down the thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadowmy chief acquaintances at lefferts corners had been the affable reporters of whom several still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy it was from these that i determined to choose a colleague and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined toward one arthur munroe a dark lean man of about thirtyfive whose education taste intelligence and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experienceson an afternoon in early september arthur munroe listened to my story i saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic and when i had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment his advice moreover was eminently practical for he recommended a postponement of operations at the martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data on his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible martense family and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary we also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes and arranged to precede our culminating taskthe exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed historywith an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legendthe results of this examination were not at first very enlightening though our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant trend namely that the number of reported horrors was by far the greatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or connected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest there were it is true exceptions indeed the horror which had caught the worlds ear had happened in a treeless space remote alike from the mansion and from any connecting woodsas to the nature and appearance of the lurking fear nothing could be gained from the scared and witless shantydwellers in the same breath they called it a snake and a giant a thunderdevil and a bat a vulture and a walking tree we did however deem ourselves justified in assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms and although certain of the stories suggested wings we believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probable theory the only thing really incompatible with the latter view was the rapidity with which the creature must have travelled in order to perform all the deeds attributed to itwhen we came to know the squatters better we found them curiously likeable in many ways simple animals they were gently descending the evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and stultifying isolation they feared outsiders but slowly grew accustomed to us finally helping vastly when we beat down all the thickets and tore out all the partitions of the mansion in our search for the lurking fear when we asked them to help us find bennett and tobey they were truly distressed for they wanted to help us yet knew that these victims had gone as wholly out of the world as their own missing people that great numbers of them had actually been killed and removed just as the wild animals had long been exterminated we were of course thoroughly convinced and we waited apprehensively for further tragedies to occurby the middle of october we were puzzled by our lack of progress owing to the clear nights no daemoniac aggressions had taken place and the completeness of our vain searches of house and country almost drove us to regard the lurking fear as a nonmaterial agency we feared that the cold weather would come on and halt our explorations for all agreed that the daemon was generally quiet in winter thus there was a kind of haste and desperation in our last daylight canvass of the horrorvisited hamlet a hamlet now deserted because of the squatters fearsthe illfated squatter hamlet had borne no name but had long stood in a sheltered though treeless cleft between two elevations called respectively cone mountain and maple hill it was closer to maple hill than to cone mountain some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on the side of the former eminence geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of tempest mountain and three miles from the oakgirt mansion of the distance between the hamlet and the mansion fully two miles and a quarter on the hamlets side was entirely open country the plain being of fairly level character save for some of the low snakelike mounds and having as vegetation only grass and scattered weeds considering this topography we had finally concluded that the daemon must have come by way of cone mountain a wooded southern prolongation of which ran to within a short distance of the westernmost spur of tempest mountain the upheaval of ground we traced conclusively to a landslide from maple hill a tall lone splintered tree on whose side had been the striking point of the thunderbolt which summoned the fiendas for the twentieth time or more arthur munroe and i went minutely over every inch of the violated village we were filled with a certain discouragement coupled with vague and novel fears it was acutely uncanny even when frightful and uncanny things were common to encounter so blankly clueless a scene after such overwhelming occurrences and we moved about beneath the leaden darkening sky with that tragic directionless zeal which results from a combined sense of futility and necessity of action our care was gravely minute every cottage was again entered every hillside dugout again searched for bodies every thorny foot of adjacent slope again scanned for dens and caves but all without result and yet as i have said vague new fears hovered menacingly over us as if giant batwinged gryphons squatted invisibly on the mountaintops and leered with abaddoneyes that had looked on transcosmic gulfsas the afternoon advanced it became increasingly difficult to see and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain this sound in such a locality naturally stirred us though less than it would have done at night as it was we hoped desperately that the storm would last until well after dark and with that hope turned from our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation timid as they were a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our protective leadership to promise such helpwe had hardly more than turned however when there descended such a blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative the extreme almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble sadly but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our minute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin of the lot an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still existing door and single tiny window both faced maple hill barring the door after us against the fury of the wind and rain we put in place the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught us where to find it was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the pitchy darkness but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our pocket lamps about now and then we could see the lightning through the cracks in the wall the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each flash was extremely vividthe stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on tempest mountain my mind turned to that odd question which had kept recurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened and again i wondered why the daemon approaching the three watchers either from the window or the interior had begun with the men on each side and left the middle man till the last when the titan fireball had scared it away why had it not taken its victims in natural order with myself second from whichever direction it had approached with what manner of farreaching tentacles did it prey or did it know that i was the leader and save me for a fate worse than that of my companionsin the midst of these reflections as if dramatically arranged to intensify them there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth at the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation we were sure that the lone tree on maple hill had been struck again and munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage when he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in so that i could not hear what he said but i waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom natures pandemoniumgradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storms passing i had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing suggesting to munroe that we had better get some light even if more showers came i unbarred and opened the crude door the ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide but i saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window crossing to where he leaned i touched his shoulder but he did not move then as i playfully shook him and turned him around i felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond timefor arthur munroe was dead and on what remained of his chewed and gouged head there was no longer a faceiii what the red glare meanton the tempestracked night of november 8 1921 with a lantern which cast charnel shadows i stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of jan martense i had begun to dig in the afternoon because a thunderstorm was brewing and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage i was gladi believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since august 5th the daemon shadow in the mansion the general strain and disappointment and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an october storm after that thing i had dug a grave for one whose death i could not understand i knew that others could not understand either so let them think arthur munroe had wandered away they searched but found nothing the squatters might have understood but i dared not frighten them more i myself seemed strangely callous that shock at the mansion had done something to my brain and i could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination a quest which the fate of arthur munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitarythe scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any ordinary man baleful primal trees of unholy size age and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish druidic temple muffling the thunder hushing the clawing wind and admitting but little rain beyond the scarred trunks in the background illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion while somewhat nearer was the abandoned dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white fungous foetid overnourished vegetation that never saw full daylight and nearest of all was the graveyard where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below now and then beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest darkness i could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterised the lightningpierced regionhistory had led me to this archaic grave history indeed was all i had after everything else ended in mocking satanism i now believed that the lurking fear was no material thing but a wolffanged ghost that rode the midnight lightning and i believed because of the masses of local tradition i had unearthed in my search with arthur munroe that the ghost was that of jan martense who died in 1762 that is why i was digging idiotically in his gravethe martense mansion was built in 1670 by gerrit martense a wealthy newamsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under british rule and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him the only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer when selecting the hill and building his mansion mynheer martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena at length having found these storms injurious to his health he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their wildest pandemoniumof gerrit martenses descendants less is known than of himself since they were all reared in hatred of the english civilisation and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it their life was exceedingly secluded and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and comprehension in appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes one generally being blue and the other brown their social contacts grew fewer and fewer till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate many of the crowded family degenerated moved across the valley and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters the rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion becoming more and more clannish and taciturn yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstormsmost of this information reached the outside world through young jan martense who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when news of the albany convention reached tempest mountain he was the first of gerrits descendants to see much of the world and when he returned in 1760 after six years of campaigning he was hated as an outsider by his father uncles and brothers in spite of his dissimilar martense eyes no longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the martenses while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before instead his surroundings depressed him and he frequently wrote to a friend in albany of plans to leave the paternal roofin the spring of 1763 jonathan gifford the albany friend of jan martense became worried by his correspondents silence especially in view of the conditions and quarrels at the martense mansion determined to visit jan in person he went into the mountains on horseback his diary states that he reached tempest mountain on september 20 finding the mansion in great decrepitude the sullen oddeyed martenses whose unclean animal aspect shocked him told him in broken gutturals that jan was dead he had they insisted been struck by lightning the autumn before and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens they shewed the visitor the grave barren and devoid of markers something in the martenses manner gave gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot he found what he expecteda skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blowsso returning to albany he openly charged the martenses with the murder of their kinsmanlegal evidence was lacking but the story spread rapidly round the countryside and from that time the martenses were ostracised by the world no one would deal with them and their distant manor was shunned as an accursed place somehow they managed to live on independently by the products of their estate for occasional lights glimpsed from faraway hills attested their continued presence these lights were seen as late as 1810 but toward the last they became very infrequentmeanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply it remained unvisited till 1816 when the continued absence of lights was noticed by the squatters at that time a party made investigations finding the house deserted and partly in ruinsthere were no skeletons about so that departure rather than death was inferred the clan seemed to have left several years before and improvised penthouses shewed how numerous it had grown prior to its migration its cultural level had fallen very low as proved by decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned when its owners left but though the dreaded martenses were gone the fear of the haunted house continued and grew very acute when new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents there it stood deserted feared and linked with the vengeful ghost of jan martense there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martenses gravei have described my protracted digging as idiotic and such it indeed was in object and method the coffin of jan martense had soon been unearthedit now held only dust and nitrebut in my fury to exhume his ghost i delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had lain god knows what i expected to findi only felt that i was digging in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by nightit is impossible to say what monstrous depth i had attained when my spade and soon my feet broke through the ground beneath the event under the circumstances was tremendous for in the existence of a subterranean space here my mad theories had terrible confirmation my slight fall had extinguished the lantern but i produced an electric pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away indefinitely in both directions it was amply large enough for a man to wriggle through and though no sane person would have tried it at that time i forgot danger reason and cleanliness in my singleminded fever to unearth the lurking fear choosing the direction toward the house i scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow squirming ahead blindly and rapidly and flashing but seldom the lamp i kept before mewhat language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely abysmal earth pawing twisting wheezing scrambling madly through sunken convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time safety direction or definite object there is something hideous in it but that is what i did i did it for so long that life faded to a far memory and i became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths indeed it was only by accident that after interminable writhings i jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight so that it shone eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved aheadi had been scrambling in this way for some time so that my battery had burned very low when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward altering my mode of progress and as i raised my glance it was without preparation that i saw glistening in the distance two daemoniac reflections of my expiring lamp two reflections glowing with a baneful and unmistakable effulgence and provoking maddeningly nebulous memories i stopped automatically though lacking the brain to retreat the eyes approached yet of the thing that bore them i could distinguish only a claw but what a claw then far overhead i heard a faint crashing which i recognised it was the wild thunder of the mountain raised to hysteric furyi must have been crawling upward for some time so that the surface was now quite near and as the muffled thunder clattered those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousnessthank god i did not then know what it was else i should have died but i was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it for after a hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath i had noticed here and there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes with cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit blinding and deafening me yet not wholly reducing me to a comain the chaos of sliding shifting earth i clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and i saw that i had come to the surface in a familiar spot a steep unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope but there was nothing in the chaos to shew my place of egress from the lethal catacomb my brain was as great a chaos as the earth and as a distant red glare burst on the landscape from the south i hardly realised the horror i had been throughbut when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant i felt more horror than that which the mouldburrow and the claw and eyes had given more horror because of the overwhelming implications in a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt which brought me above ground and a nameless thing had dropped from an overhanging tree into a weakroofed cabin it had done a deed but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape it had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyesiv the horror in the eyesthere can be nothing normal in the mind of one who knowing what i knew of the horrors of tempest mountain would seek alone for the fear that lurked there that at least two of the fears embodiments were destroyed formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this acheron of multiform diabolism yet i continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrouswhen two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw i learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me i experienced virtual convulsions of fright but that fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness that it was almost a pleasant sensation sometimes in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dreamdoom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn and so it was with the waking nightmare of tempest mountain the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the accursed region and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from every inch of the poisonous soilas soon as possible i visited the grave of jan martense and dug vainly where i had dug before some extensive cavein had obliterated all trace of the underground passage while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that i could not tell how deeply i had dug that other day i likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the deathcreature had been burnt and was little repaid for my trouble in the ashes of the fateful cabin i found several bones but apparently none of the monsters the squatters said the thing had had only one victim but in this i judged them inaccurate since besides the complete skull of a human being there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen no one could say just what the creature was like those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil examining the great tree where it had lurked i could discern no distinctive marks i tried to find some trail into the black forest but on this occasion could not stand the sight of those morbidly large boles or of those vast serpentlike roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earthmy next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet where death had come most abundantly and where arthur munroe had seen something he never lived to describe though my vain previous searches had been exceedingly minute i now had new data to test for my horrible gravecrawl convinced me that at least one of the phases of the monstrosity had been an underground creature this time on the fourteenth of november my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of cone mountain and maple hill where they overlook the unfortunate hamlet and i gave particular attention to the loose earth of the landslide region on the latter eminencethe afternoon of my search brought nothing to light and dusk came as i stood on maple hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to tempest mountain there had been a gorgeous sunset and now the moon came up nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain the distant mountainside and the curious low mounds that rose here and there it was a peaceful arcadian scene but knowing what it hid i hated it i hated the mocking moon the hypocritical plain the festering mountain and those sinister mounds everything seemed to me tainted with a loathsome contagion and inspired by a noxious alliance with distorted hidden powerspresently as i gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama my eye became attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of a certain topographical element without having any exact knowledge of geology i had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region i had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around tempest mountain though less numerous on the plain than near the hilltop itself where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices now in the light of that low moon which cast long weird shadows it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the mound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of tempest mountain that summit was undeniably a centre from which the lines or rows of points radiated indefinitely and irregularly as if the unwholesome martense mansion had thrown visible tentacles of terror the idea of such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill and i stopped to analyse my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomenathe more i analysed the less i believed and against my newly opened mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth before i knew it i was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself my god molehills the damned place must be honeycombed how many that night at the mansion they took bennett and tobey first on each side of us then i was digging frantically into the mound which had stretched nearest me digging desperately shiveringly but almost jubilantly digging and at last shrieking aloud with some unplaced emotion as i came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one through which i had crawled on that other daemoniac nightafter that i recall running spade in hand a hideous run across moonlitten moundmarked meadows and through diseased precipitous abysses of haunted hillside forest leaping screaming panting bounding toward the terrible martense mansion i recall digging unreasoningly in all parts of the brierchoked cellar digging to find the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds and then i recall how i laughed when i stumbled on the passageway the hole at the base of the old chimney where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone candle i had happened to have with me what still remained down in that hellhive lurking and waiting for the thunder to arouse it i did not know two had been killed perhaps that had finished it but still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear which i had once more come to deem definite material and organicmy indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and immediately with my pocketlight or to try to assemble a band of squatters for the quest was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness the moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures above me and with a sense of fateful alarm i heard the sinister and significant rumble of approaching thunder a confusion of associated ideas possessed my brain leading me to grope back toward the farthest corner of the cellar my eyes however never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney and i began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the woods outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall every second i was consumed with a mixture of fear and curiosity what would the storm call forthor was there anything left for it to call guided by a lightning flash i settled myself down behind a dense clump of vegetation through which i could see the opening without being seenif heaven is merciful it will some day efface from my consciousness the sight that i saw and let me live my last years in peace i cannot sleep at night now and have to take opiates when it thunders the thing came abruptly and unannounced a daemon ratlike scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable a hellish panting and stifled grunting and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous lifea loathsome nightspawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity seething stewing surging bubbling like serpents slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egressstreaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear madness and deathgod knows how many there werethere must have been thousands to see the stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking when they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms i saw that they were dwarfed deformed hairy devils or apesmonstrous and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe they were so hideously silent there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion others snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish then in spite of my daze of fright and disgust my morbid curiosity triumphed and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare i drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thundershrieking slithering torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless ensanguined corridors of purple fulgurous sky formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish remembered scene forests of monstrous overnourished oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils moundlike tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion insane lightning over malignant ivied walls and daemon arcades choked with fungous vegetation heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skiesi had recovered enough in a week to send to albany for a gang of men to blow up the martense mansion and the entire top of tempest mountain with dynamite stop up all the discoverable moundburrows and destroy certain overnourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity i could sleep a little after they had done this but true rest will never come as long as i remember that nameless secret of the lurking fear the thing will haunt me for who can say the extermination is complete and that analogous phenomena do not exist all over the world who can with my knowledge think of the earths unknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities i cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering why cannot the doctors give me something to make me sleep or truly calm my brain when it thunderswhat i saw in the glow of my flashlight after i shot the unspeakable straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before i understood and went delirious the object was nauseous a filthy whitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur it was the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration the frightful outcome of isolated spawning multiplication and cannibal nutrition above and below the ground the embodiment of all the snarling chaos and grinning fear that lurk behind life it had looked at me as it died and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections one eye was blue the other brown they were the dissimilar martense eyes of the old legends and i knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family the terrible and thundercrazed house of martense,1
ben hayden was always a stubborn chap and once he had heard about those strange statues in the upper adirondacks nothing could keep him from going to see them i had been his closest acquaintance for years and our damon and pythias friendship made us inseparable at all times so when ben firmly decided to gowell i had to trot along too like a faithful colliejack he said you know henry jackson who was up in a shack beyond lake placid for that beastly spot in his lung well he came back the other day nearly cured but had a lot to say about some devilish queer conditions up there he ran into the business all of a sudden and cant be sure yet that its anything more than a case of bizarre sculpture but just the same his uneasy impression sticksit seems he was out hunting one day and came across a cave with what looked like a dog in front of it just as he was expecting the dog to bark he looked again and saw that the thing wasnt alive at all it was a stone dogsuch a perfect image down to the smallest whisker that he couldnt decide whether it was a supernaturally clever statue or a petrified animal he was almost afraid to touch it but when he did he realised it was surely made of stoneafter a while he nerved himself up to go into the caveand there he got a still bigger jolt only a little way in there was another stone figureor what looked like itbut this time it was a mans it lay on the floor on its side wore clothes and had a peculiar smile on its face this time henry didnt stop to do any touching but beat it straight for the village mountain top you know of course he asked questionsbut they did not get him very far he found he was on a ticklish subject for the natives only shook their heads crossed their fingers and muttered something about a mad danwhoever he wasit was too much for jackson so he came home weeks ahead of his planned time he told me all about it because he knows how fond i am of strange thingsand oddly enough i was able to fish up a recollection that dovetailed pretty neatly with his yarn do you remember arthur wheeler the sculptor who was such a realist that people began calling him nothing but a solid photographer i think you knew him slightly well as a matter of fact he ended up in that part of the adirondacks himself spent a lot of time there and then dropped out of sight never heard from again now if stone statues that look like men and dogs are turning up around there it looks to me as if they might be his workno matter what the rustics say or refuse to say about them of course a fellow with jacksons nerves might easily get flighty and disturbed over things like that but id have done a lot of examining before running awayin fact jack im going up there now to look things overand youre coming along with me it would mean a lot to find wheeleror any of his work anyhow the mountain air will brace us both upso less than a week later after a long train ride and a jolting bus trip through breathlessly exquisite scenery we arrived at mountain top in the late golden sunlight of a june evening the village comprised only a few small houses a hotel and the general store at which our bus drew up but we knew that the latter would probably prove a focus for such information surely enough the usual group of idlers was gathered around the steps and when we represented ourselves as healthseekers in search of lodgings they had many recommendations to offerthough we had not planned to do any investigating till the next day ben could not resist venturing some vague cautious questions when he noticed the senile garrulousness of one of the illclad loafers he felt from jacksons previous experience that it would be useless to begin with references to the queer statues but decided to mention wheeler as one whom we had known and in whose fate we consequently had a right to be interestedthe crowd seemed uneasy when sam stopped his whittling and started talking but they had slight occasion for alarm even this barefoot old mountain decadent tightened up when he heard wheelers name and only with difficulty could ben get anything coherent out of himwheeler he had finally wheezed oh yehthat feller as was all the time blastin rocks and cuttin em up into statues so yew knowed him hey wal they aint much we kin tell ye and mebbe thats too much he stayed out to mad dans cabin in the hillsbut not so very long got so he want wanted no more by dan that is kinder softspoken and got around dans wife till the old devil took notice pretty sweet on her i guess but he took the trail sudden and nobodys seen hide nor hair of him since dan must a told him sumthin pretty plainbad feller to get agin ye dan is better keep away from thar boys for they aint no good in that part of the hills dans ben workin up a worse and worse mood and aint seen about no more nor his wife neither guess hes penned her up sos nobody else kin make eyes at heras sam resumed his whittling after a few more observations ben and i exchanged glances here surely was a new lead which deserved intensive following up deciding to lodge at the hotel we settled ourselves as quickly as possible planning for a plunge into the wild hilly country on the next dayat sunrise we made our start each bearing a knapsack laden with provisions and such tools as we thought we might need the day before us had an almost stimulating air of invitationthrough which only a faint undercurrent of the sinister ran our rough mountain road quickly became steep and winding so that before long our feet ached considerablyafter about two miles we left the roadcrossing a stone wall on our right near a great elm and striking off diagonally toward a steeper slope according to the chart and directions which jackson had prepared for us it was rough and briery travelling but we knew that the cave could not be far off in the end we came upon the aperture quite suddenlya black bushgrown crevice where the ground shot abruptly upward and beside it near a shallow rock pool a small still figure stood rigidas if rivalling its own uncanny petrificationit was a grey dogor a dogs statueand as our simultaneous gasp died away we scarcely knew what to think jackson had exaggerated nothing and we could not believe that any sculptors hand had succeeded in producing such perfection every hair of the animals magnificent coat seemed distinct and those on the back were bristled up as if some unknown thing had taken him unaware ben at last halfkindly touching the delicate stony fur gave vent to an exclamationgood god jack but this cant be any statue look at itall the little details and the way the hair lies none of wheelers technique here this is a real dogthough heaven only knows how he ever got in this state just like stonefeel for yourself do you suppose theres any strange gas that sometimes comes out of the cave and does this to animal life we ought to have looked more into the local legends and if this is a real dogor was a real dogthen that man inside must be the real thing tooit was with a good deal of genuine solemnityalmost dreadthat we finally crawled on hands and knees through the cavemouth ben leading the narrowness looked hardly three feet after which the grotto expanded in every direction to form a damp twilight chamber floored with rubble and detritus for a time we could make out very little but as we rose to our feet and strained our eyes we began slowly to descry a recumbent figure amidst the greater darkness ahead ben fumbled with his flashlight but hesitated for a moment before turning it on the prostrate figure we had little doubt that the stony thing was what had once been a man and something in the thought unnerved us bothwhen ben at last sent forth the electric beam we saw that the object lay on its side back toward us it was clearly of the same material as the dog outside but was dressed in the mouldering and unpetrified remains of rough sport clothing braced as we were for a shock we approached quite calmly to examine the thing ben going around to the other side to glimpse the averted face neither could possibly have been prepared for what ben saw when he flashed the light on those stony features his cry was wholly excusable and i could not help echoing it as i leaped to his side and shared the sight yet it was nothing hideous or intrinsically terrifying it was merely a matter of recognition for beyond the least shadow of a doubt this chilly rock figure with its halffrightened halfbitter expression had at one time been our old acquaintance arthur wheelersome instinct sent us staggering and crawling out of the cave and down the tangled slope to a point whence we could not see the ominous stone dog we hardly knew what to think for our brains were churning with conjectures and apprehensions ben who had known wheeler well was especially upset and seemed to be piecing together some threads i had overlookedagain and again as we paused on the green slope he repeated poor arthur poor arthur but not till he muttered the name mad dan did i recall the trouble into which according to old sam poole wheeler had run just before his disappearance mad dan ben implied would doubtless be glad to see what had happened for a moment it flashed over both of us that the jealous host might have been responsible for the sculptors presence in this evil cave but the thought went as quickly as it camethe thing that puzzled us most was to account for the phenomenon itself what gaseous emanation or mineral vapour could have wrought this change in so relatively short a time was utterly beyond us normal petrification we know is a slow chemical replacement process requiring vast ages for completion yet here were two stone images which had been living thingsor at least wheeler hadonly a few weeks before conjecture was useless clearly nothing remained but to notify the authorities and let them guess what they might and yet at the back of bens head that notion about mad dan still persisted anyhow we clawed our way back to the road but ben did not turn toward the village but looked along upward toward where old sam had said dans cabin lay it was the second house from the village the ancient loafer had wheezed and lay on the left far back from the road in a thick copse of scrub oaks before i knew it ben was dragging me up the sandy highway past a dingy farmstead and into a region of increasing wildnessit did not occur to me to protest but i felt a certain sense of mounting menace as the familiar marks of agriculture and civilisation grew fewer and fewer at last the beginning of a narrow neglected path opened up on our left while the peaked roof of a squalid unpainted building shewed itself beyond a sickly growth of halfdead trees this i knew must be mad dans cabin and i wondered that wheeler had ever chosen so unprepossessing a place for his headquarters i dreaded to walk up that weedy uninviting path but could not lag behind when ben strode determinedly along and began a vigorous rapping at the rickety mustysmelling doorthere was no response to the knock and something in its echoes sent a series of shivers through one ben however was quite unperturbed and at once began to circle the house in quest of unlocked windows the third that he triedin the rear of the dismal cabinproved capable of opening and after a boost and a vigorous spring he was safely inside and helping me after himthe room in which we landed was full of limestone and granite blocks chiselling tools and clay models and we realised at once that it was wheelers erstwhile studio so far we had not met with any sign of life but over everything hovered a damnably ominous dusty odour on our left was an open door evidently leading to a kitchen on the chimney side of the house and through this ben started intent on finding anything he could concerning his friends last habitat he was considerably ahead of me when he crossed the threshold so that i could not see at first what brought him up short and wrung a low cry of horror from his lipsin another moment though i did seeand repeated his cry as instinctively as i had done in the cave for here in this cabinfar from any subterranean depths which could breed strange gases and work strange mutationswere two stony figures which i knew at once were no products of arthur wheelers chisel in a rude armchair before the fireplace bound in position by the lash of a long rawhide whip was the form of a manunkempt elderly and with a look of fathomless horror on its evil petrified faceon the floor beside it lay a womans figure graceful and with a face betokening considerable youth and beauty its expression seemed to be one of sardonic satisfaction and near its outflung right hand was a large tin pail somewhat stained on the inside as with a darkish sedimentwe made no move to approach those inexplicably petrified bodies nor did we exchange any but the simplest conjectures that this stony couple had been mad dan and his wife we could not well doubt but how to account for their present condition was another matter as we looked horrifiedly around we saw the suddenness with which the final development must have comefor everything about us seemed despite a heavy coating of dust to have been left in the midst of commonplace household activitiesthe only exception to this rule of casualness was on the kitchen table in whose cleared centre as if to attract attention lay a thin battered blankbook weighted down by a sizeable tin funnel crossing to read the thing ben saw that it was a kind of diary or set of dated entries written in a somewhat cramped and none too practiced hand the very first words riveted my attention and before ten seconds had elapsed he was breathlessly devouring the halting texti avidly following as i peered over his shoulder as we read onmoving as we did so into the less loathsome atmosphere of the adjoining roommany obscure things became terribly clear to us and we trembled with a mixture of complex emotionsthis is what we readand what the coroner read later on the public has seen a highly twisted and sensationalised version in the cheap newspapers but not even that has more than a fraction of the genuine terror which the simple original held for us as we puzzled it out alone in that musty cabin among the wild hills with two monstrous stone abnormalities lurking in the deathlike silence of the next room when we had finished ben pocketed the book with a gesture half of repulsion and his first words were lets get out of heresilently and nervously we stumbled to the front of the house unlocked the door and began the long tramp back to the village there were many statements to make and questions to answer in the days that followed and i do not think that either ben or i can ever shake off the effects of the whole harrowing experience neither can some of the local authorities and city reporters who flocked aroundeven though they burned a certain book and many papers found in attic boxes and destroyed considerable apparatus in the deepest part of that sinister hillside cave but here is the text itselfnov 5my name is daniel morris around here they call me mad dan because i believe in powers that nobody else believes in nowadays when i go up on thunder hill to keep the feast of the foxes they think i am crazyall except the back country folks that are afraid of me they try to stop me from sacrificing the black goat at hallow eve and always prevent my doing the great rite that would open the gate they ought to know better for they know i am a van kauran on my mothers side and anybody this side of the hudson can tell what the van kaurans have handed down we come from nicholas van kauran the wizard who was hanged in wijtgaart in 1587 and everybody knows he had made the bargain with the black manthe soldiers never got hisbook of eibonwhen they burned his house and his grandson william van kauran brought it over when he came to rensselaerwyck and later crossed the river to esopus ask anybody in kingston or hurley about what the william van kauran line could do to people that got in their way also ask them if my uncle hendrik didnt manage to keep hold of thebook of eibonwhen they ran him out of town and he went up the river to this place with his familyi am writing thisand am going to keep writing thisbecause i want people to know the truth after i am gone also i am afraid i shall really go mad if i dont set things down in plain black and white everything is going against me and if it keeps up i shall have to use the secrets in thebookand call in certain powers three months ago that sculptor arthur wheeler came to mountain top and they sent him up to me because i am the only man in the place who knows anything except farming hunting and fleecing summer boarders the fellow seemed to be interested in what i had to say and made a deal to stop here for 1300 a week with meals i gave him the back room beside the kitchen for his lumps of stone and his chiselling and arranged with nate williams to tend to his rock blasting and haul his big pieces with a drag and yoke of oxenthat was three months ago now i know why that cursed son of hell took so quick to the place it wasnt my talk at all but the looks of my wife rose that is osborne chandlers oldest girl she is sixteen years younger than i am and is always casting sheeps eyes at the fellows in town but we always managed to get along fine enough till this dirty rat shewed up even if she did balk at helping me with the rites on roodmas and hallowmass i can see now that wheeler is working on her feelings and getting her so fond of him that she hardly looks at me and i suppose hell try to elope with her sooner or laterbut he works slow like all sly polished dogs and ive got plenty of time to think up what to do about it they dont either of them know i suspect anything but before long theyll both realise it doesnt pay to break up a van kaurans home i promise them plenty of novelty in what ill donov 25thanksgiving day thats a pretty good joke but at that ill have something to be thankful for when i finish what ive started no question but that wheeler is trying to steal my wife for the time being though ill let him keep on being a star boarder got thebook of eibondown from uncle hendriks old trunk in the attic last week and am looking up something good which wont require sacrifices that i cant make around here i want something thatll finish these two sneaking traitors and at the same time get me into no trouble if it has a twist of drama in it so much the better ive thought of calling in the emanation of yoth but that needs a childs blood and i must be careful about the neighbours the green decay looks promising but that would be a bit unpleasant for me as well as for them i dont like certain sights and smellsdec 10eurekaive got the very thing at last revenge is sweetand this is the perfect climax wheeler the sculptorthis is too good yes indeed that damned sneak is going to produce a statue that will sell quicker than any of the things hes been carving these past weeks a realist eh wellthe new statuary wont lack any realism i found the formula in a manuscript insert opposite page 679 of thebookfrom the handwriting i judge it was put there by my greatgrandfather bareut picterse van kauranthe one who disappeared from new paltz in 1839i shubnigguraththe goat with a thousand youngto be plain ive found a way to turn those wretched rats into stone statues its absurdly simple and really depends more on plain chemistry than on the outer powers if i can get hold of the right stuff i can brew a drink thatll pass for homemade wine and one swig ought to finish any ordinary being short of an elephant what it amounts to is a kind of petrification infinitely speeded up shoots the whole system full of calcium and barium salts and replaces living cells with mineral matter so fast that nothing can stop it it must have been one of those things greatgrandfather got at the great sabbat on sugarloaf in the catskills queer things used to go on there seems to me i heard of a man in new paltzsquire hasbrouckturned to stone or something like that in 1834 he was an enemy of the van kaurans first thing i must do is order the five chemicals i need from albany and montreal plenty of time later to experiment when everything is over ill round up all the statues and sell them as wheelers work to pay for his overdue board bill he always was a realist and an egoistwouldnt it be natural for him to make a selfportrait in stone and to use my wife for another modelas indeed hes really been doing for the past fortnight trust the dull public not to askwhat quarrythe queer stone came fromdec 25christmas peace on earth and so forth these two swine are goggling at each other as if i didnt exist they must think im deaf dumb and blind well the barium sulphate and calcium chloride came from albany last thursday and the acids catalytics and instruments are due from montreal any day now the mills of the godsand all that ill do the work in allens cave near the lower wood lot and at the same time will be openly making some wine in the cellar here there ought to be some excuse for offering a new drinkthough it wont take much planning to fool those moonstruck nincompoops the trouble will be to make rose take wine for she pretends not to like it any experiments that i make on animals will be down at the cave and nobody ever thinks of going there in winter ill do some woodcutting to account for my time away a small load or two brought in will keep him off the trackjan 20its harder work than i thought a lot depends on the exact proportions the stuff came from montreal but i had to send again for some better scales and an acetylene lamp theyre getting curious down at the village wish the express office werent in steenwycks store am trying various mixtures on the sparrows that drink and bathe in the pool in front of the cavewhen its melted sometimes it kills them but sometimes they fly away clearly ive missed some important reaction i suppose rose and that upstart are making the most of my absencebut i can afford to let them there can be no doubt of my success in the endfeb 11have got it at last put a fresh lot in the little poolwhich is well melted todayand the first bird that drank toppled over as if he were shot i picked him up a second later and he was a perfect piece of stone down to the smallest claws and feather not a muscle changed since he was poised for drinking so he must have died the instant any of the stuff got to his stomach i didnt expect the petrification to come so soon but a sparrow isnt a fair test of the way the thing would act with a large animal i must get something bigger to try it on for it must be the right strength when i give it to those swine i guess roses dog rex will do ill take him along the next time and say a timber wolf got him she thinks a lot of him and i shant be sorry to give her something to sniffle over before the big reckoning i must be careful where i keep this book rose sometimes pries around in the queerest placesfeb 15getting warm tried it on rex and it worked like a charm with only double the strength i fixed the rock pool and got him to drink he seemed to know something queer had hit him for he bristled and growled but he was a piece of stone before he could turn his head the solution ought to have been stronger and for a human being ought to be very much stronger i think im getting the hang of it now and am about ready for that cur wheeler the stuff seems to be tasteless but to make sure ill flavour it with the new wine im making up at the house wish i were surer about the tastelessness so i could give it to rose in water without trying to urge wine on her ill get the two separatelywheeler out here and rose at home have just fixed a strong solution and cleared away all strange objects in front of the cave rose whimpered like a puppy when i told her a wolf had got rex and wheeler gurgled a lot of sympathymarch 1i rlyehpraise the lord tsathoggua ive got the son of hell at last told him id found a new ledge of friable limestone down this way and he trotted after me like the yellow cur he is i had the wineflavoured stuff in a bottle on my hip and he was glad of a swig when we got here gulped it down without a winkand dropped in his tracks before you could count three but he knows ive had my vengeance for i made a face at him that he couldnt miss i saw the look of understanding come into his face as he keeled over in two minutes he was solid stonei dragged him into the cave and put rexs figure outside again that bristling dog shape will help to scare people off its getting time for the spring hunters and besides theres a damned lunger named jackson in a cabin over the hill who does a lot of snooping around in the snow i wouldnt want my laboratory and storeroom to be found just yet when i got home i told rose that wheeler had found a telegram at the village summoning him suddenly home i dont know whether she believed me or not but it doesnt matter for forms sake i packed wheelers things and took them down the hill telling her i was going to ship them after him i put them in the dry well at the abandoned rapelye place now for rosemarch 3cant get rose to drink any wine i hope that stuff is tasteless enough to go unnoticed in water i tried it in tea and coffee but it forms a precipitate and cant be used that way if i use it in water ill have to cut down the dose and trust to a more gradual action mr and mrs hoog dropped in this noon and i had hard work keeping the conversation away from wheelers departure it mustnt get around that we say he was called back to new york when everybody at the village knows no telegram came and that he didnt leave on the bus rose is acting damned queer about the whole thing ill have to pick a quarrel with her and keep her locked in the attic the best way is to try to make her drink that doctored wineand if she does give in so much bettermarch 7have started in on rose she wouldnt drink the wine so i took a whip to her and drove her up in the attic shell never come down alive i pass her a platter of salty bread and salt meat and a pail of slightly doctored water twice a day the salt food ought to make her drink a lot and it cant be long before the action sets in i dont like the way she shouts about wheeler when im at the door the rest of the time she is absolutely silentmarch 9its damned peculiar how slow that stuff is in getting hold of rose ill have to make it strongerprobably shell never taste it with all the salt ive been feeding her well if it doesnt get her there are plenty of other ways to fall back on but i would like to carry this neat statue plan through went to the cave this morning and all is well there i sometimes hear roses steps on the ceiling overhead and i think theyre getting more and more dragging the stuff is certainly working but its too slow not strong enough from now on ill rapidly stiffen up the dosemarch 11it is very queer she is still alive and moving tuesday night i heard her piggling with a window so went up and gave her a rawhiding she acts more sullen than frightened and her eyes look swollen but she could never drop to the ground from that height and theres nowhere she could climb down i have had dreams at night for her slow dragging pacing on the floor above gets on my nerves sometimes i think she works at the lock on the doormarch 15still alive despite all the strengthening of the dose theres something queer about it she crawls now and doesnt pace very often but the sound of her crawling is horrible she rattles the windows too and fumbles with the door i shall have to finish her off with the rawhide if this keeps up im getting very sleepy wonder if rose has got on her guard somehow but she must be drinking the stuff this sleepiness is abnormali think the strain is telling on me im sleepy here the cramped handwriting trails out in a vague scrawl giving place to a note in a firmer evidently feminine handwriting indicative of great emotional tensionmarch 164 amthis is added by rose c morris about to die please notify my father osborne e chandler route 2 mountain top ny i have just read what the beast has written i felt sure he had killed arthur wheeler but did not know how till i read this terrible notebook now i know what i escaped i noticed the water tasted queer so took none of it after the first sip i threw it all out of the window that one sip has half paralysed me but i can still get about the thirst was terrible but i ate as little as possible of the salty food and was able to get a little water by setting some old pans and dishes that were up here under places where the roof leakedthere were two great rains i thought he was trying to poison me though i didnt know what the poison was like what he has written about himself and me is a lie we were never happy together and i think i married him only under one of those spells that he was able to lay on people i guess he hypnotised both my father and me for he was always hated and feared and suspected of dark dealings with the devil my father once called him the devils kin and he was rightno one will ever know what i went through as his wife it was not simply common crueltythough god knows he was cruel enough and beat me often with a leather whip it was moremore than anyone in this age can ever understand he was a monstrous creature and practiced all sorts of hellish ceremonies handed down by his mothers people he tried to make me help in the ritesand i dont dare even hint what they were i would not so he beat me it would be blasphemy to tell what he tried to make me do i can say he was a murderer even then for i know what he sacrificed one night on thunder hill he was surely the devils kin i tried four times to run away but he always caught and beat me also he had a sort of hold over my mind and even over my fathers mindabout arthur wheeler i have nothing to be ashamed of we did come to love each other but only in an honourable way he gave me the first kind treatment i had ever had since leaving my fathers and meant to help me get out of the clutches of that fiend he had several talks with my father and was going to help me get out west after my divorce we would have been marriedever since that brute locked me in the attic i have planned to get out and finish him i always kept the poison overnight in case i could escape and find him asleep and give it to him somehow at first he waked easily when i worked on the lock of the door and tested the conditions at the windows but later he began to get more tired and sleep sounder i could always tell by his snoring when he was asleeptonight he was so fast asleep i forced the lock without waking him it was hard work getting downstairs with my partial paralysis but i did i found him here with the lamp burningasleep at the table where he had been writing in this book in the corner was the long rawhide whip he had so often beaten me with i used it to tie him to the chair so he could not move a muscle i lashed his neck so that i could pour anything down his throat without his resistinghe waked up just as i was finishing and i guess he saw right off that he was done for he shouted frightful things and tried to chant mystical formulas but i choked him off with a dish towel from the sink then i saw this book he had been writing in and stopped to read it the shock was terrible and i almost fainted four or five times my mind was not ready for such things after that i talked to that fiend for two or three hours steady i told him everything i had wanted to tell him through all the years i had been his slave and a lot of other things that had to do with what i had read in this awful bookhe looked almost purple when i was through and i think he was half delirious then i got a funnel from the cupboard and jammed it into his mouth after taking out the gag he knew what i was going to do but was helpless i had brought down the pail of poisoned water and without a qualm i poured a good half of it into the funnelit must have been a very strong dose for almost at once i saw that brute begin to stiffen and turn a dull stony grey in ten minutes i knew he was solid stone i could not bear to touch him but the tin funnelclinkedhorribly when i pulled it out of his mouth i wish i could have given that kin of the devil a more painful lingering death but surely this was the most appropriate he could have hadthere is not much more to say i am halfparalysed and with arthur murdered i have nothing to live for i shall make things complete by drinking the rest of the poison after placing this book where it will be found in a quarter of an hour i shall be a stone statue my only wish is to be buried beside the statue that was arthurwhen it is found in that cave where the fiend left it poor trusting rex ought to lie at our feet i do not care what becomes of the stone devil tied in the chair,1
ithe drive toward cape girardeau had been through unfamiliar country and as the late afternoon light grew golden and halfdreamlike i realised that i must have directions if i expected to reach the town before night i did not care to be wandering about these bleak southern missouri lowlands after dark for roads were poor and the november cold rather formidable in an open roadster black clouds too were massing on the horizon so i looked about among the long grey and blue shadows that streaked the flat brownish fields hoping to glimpse some house where i might get the needed informationit was a lonely and deserted country but at last i spied a roof among a clump of trees near the small river on my right perhaps a full halfmile from the road and probably reachable by some path or drive which i would presently come upon in the absence of any nearer dwelling i resolved to try my luck there and was glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone gateway covered with dry dead vines and choked with undergrowth which explained why i had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first distant view i saw that i could not drive the car in so i parked it very carefully near the gatewhere a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rainand got out for the long walk to the housetraversing that brushgrown path in the gathering twilight i was conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding probably induced by the air of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway from the carvings on the old stone pillars i inferred that this place was once an estate of manorial dignity and i could clearly see that the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees some of which had died while others had lost their special identity among the wild scrub growths of the regionas i ploughed onward cockleburrs and stickers clung to my clothes and i began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all was i tramping on a vain errand for a moment i was tempted to go back and try some farm farther along the road when a view of the house ahead aroused my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spiritthere was something provocatively fascinating in the treegirt decrepit pile before me for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era and a far more southerly environment it was a typical wooden plantation house of the classic early nineteenthcentury pattern with two and a half stories and a great ionic portico whose pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a triangular pediment its state of decay was extreme and obvious one of the vast columns having rotted and fallen to the ground while the upper piazza or balcony had sagged dangerously low other buildings i judged had formerly stood near itas i mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and fanlighted doorway i felt distinctly nervous and started to light a cigarettedesisting when i saw how dry and inflammable everything about me was though now convinced that the house was deserted i nevertheless hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking so tugged at the rusty iron knocker until i could get it to move and finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make the whole place shake and rattle there was no response yet once more i plied the cumbrous creaking deviceas much to dispel the sense of unholy silence and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruinsomewhere near the river i heard the mournful note of a dove and it seemed as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible half in a dream i seized and rattled the ancient latch and finally gave the great sixpanelled door a frank trying it was unlocked as i could see in a moment and though it stuck and grated on its hinges i began to push it open stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as i did sobut the moment i took this step i regretted it it was not that a legion of spectres confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly empire furniture but that i knew all at once that the place was not deserted at all there was a creaking on the great curved staircase and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending then i saw a tall bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great palladian window on the landingmy first start of terror was soon over and as the figure descended the final flight i was ready to greet the householder whose privacy i had invaded in the semidarkness i could see him reach in his pocket for a match there came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs in the feeble glow was revealed the stooping figure of a very tall emaciated old man disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face yet for all that with the bearing and expression of a gentlemani did not wait for him to speak but at once began to explain my presenceyoull pardon my coming in like this but when my knocking didnt raise anybody i concluded that no one lived here what i wanted originally was to know the right road to cape girardeauthe shortest road that is i wanted to get there before dark but now of courseas i paused the man spoke in exactly the cultivated tone i had expected and with a mellow accent as unmistakably southern as the house he inhabitedrather you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly i live in a very retired way and am not usually expecting visitors at first i thought you were a mere curiosityseeker then when you knocked again i started to answer but i am not well and have to move very slowly spinal neuritisvery troublesome casebut as for your getting to town before darkits plain you cant do that the road you are onfor i suppose you came from the gateisnt the best or shortest way what you must do is to take your first left after you leave the gatethat is the first real road to your left there are three or four cart paths you can ignore but you cant mistake the real road because of the extra large willow tree on the right just opposite it then when youve turned keep on past two roads and turn to the right along the third after thatperplexed by these elaborate directionsconfusing things indeed to a total strangeri could not help interruptingplease wait a moment how can i follow all these clues in pitch darkness without ever having been near here before and with only an indifferent pair of headlights to tell me what is and what isnt a road besides i think its going to storm pretty soon and my car is an open one it looks as if i were in a bad fix if i want to get to cape girardeau tonight the fact is i dont think id better try to make it i dont like to impose burdens or anything like thatbut in view of the circumstances do you suppose you could put me up for the night i wont be any troubleno meals or anything just let me have a corner to sleep in till daylight and im all right i can leave the car in the road where it isa bit of wet weather wont hurt it if worst comes to worstas i made my sudden request i could see the old mans face lose its former expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd surprised looksleepherehe seemed so astonished at my request that i repeated ityes why not i assure you i wont be any trouble what elsecani do im a stranger hereabouts these roads are a labyrinth in the dark and ill wager itll be raining torrents outside of an hourthis time it was my hosts turn to interrupt and as he did so i could feel a peculiar quality in his deep musical voicea strangerof course you must be else you wouldnt think of sleeping here wouldnt think of coming here at all people dont come here nowadayshe paused and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke there was surely something alluringly queer about this place and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak a thousand secrets again i noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything about me manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp i felt woefully chilly and saw with regret that no heating seemed to be provided yet so great was my curiosity that i still wished most ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal abodelet that be as it may i replied i cant help about other people but i surely would like to have a spot to stop till daylight stillif people dont relish this place maynt it be because its getting so rundown of course i suppose it would take a fortune to keep such an estate up but if the burdens too great why dont you look for smaller quarters why try to stick it out here in this waywith all the hardships and discomfortsthe man did not seem offended but answered me very gravelysurely you may stay if you really wish toyoucan come to no harm that i know of but others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable influences here as for mei stay here because i have to there is something i feel it a duty to guardsomething that holds me i wish i had the money and health and ambition to take decent care of the house and groundswith my curiosity still more heightened i prepared to take my host at his word and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so it was very dark now and a faint pattering outside told me that the threatened rain had come i would have been glad of any shelter but this was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place and its master for an incurable lover of the grotesque no more fitting haven could have been providediithere was a secondfloor corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest of the house and into this my host led me setting down his small lamp and lighting a somewhat larger one from the cleanliness and contents of the room and from the books ranged along the walls i could see that i had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman of taste and breeding he was a hermit and eccentric no doubt but he still had standards and intellectual interests as he waved me to a seat i began a conversation on general topics and was pleased to find him not at all taciturn if anything he seemed glad of someone to talk to and did not even attempt to swerve the discourse from personal topicshe was i learned one antoine de russy of an ancient powerful and cultivated line of louisiana planters more than a century ago his grandfather a younger son had migrated to southern missouri and founded a new estate in the lavish ancestral manner building this pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great plantation there had been at one time as many as 200 negroes in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rearground that the river had now invadedand to hear them singing and laughing and playing the banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a civilisation and social order now sadly extinct in front of the house where the great guardian oaks and willows stood there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet always watered and trimmed and with flagstoned flowerbordered walks curving through it riversidefor such the place was calledhad been a lovely and idyllic homestead in its day and my host could recall it when many traces of its best period still lingeredit was raining hard now with dense sheets of water beating against the insecure roof walls and windows and sending in drops through a thousand chinks and crevices moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected places and the mounting wind rattled the rotting loosehinged shutters outside but i minded none of this nor even thought of my roadster outside beneath the trees for i saw that a story was coming incited to reminiscence my host made a move to shew me to sleepingquarters but kept on recalling the older better days soon i saw i would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that ancient place and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences his voice was very musical as he spoke on and his tale soon took a turn which left me no chance to grow drowsyyesriverside was built in 1816 and my father was born here in 1828 hed be over a century old now if he were alive but he died youngso young i can just barely remember him in 64 that washe was killed in the war seventh louisiana infantry csa for he went back to the old home to enlist my grandfather was too old to fight yet he lived on to be ninetyfive and helped my mother bring me up a good bringingup tooill give them credit we always had strong traditionshigh notions of honourand my grandfather saw to it that i grew up the way de russys have grown up generation after generation ever since the crusades we werent quite wiped out financially but managed to get on very comfortably after the war i went to a good school in louisiana and later to princeton later on i was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basisthough you see what its come to nowmy mother died when i was twenty and my grandfather two years later it was rather lonely after that and in 85 i married a distant cousin in new orleans things might have been different if shed lived but she died when my son denis was born then i had only denis i didnt try marriage again but gave all my time to the boy he was like melike all the de russysdarkish and tall and thin and with the devil of a temper i gave him the same training my grandfather had given me but he didnt need much training when it came to points of honour it was in him i reckon never saw such high spiritall i could do to keep him from running away to the spanish war when he was eleven romantic young devil toofull of high notionsyoud call em victorian nowno trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone i sent him to the same school id gone to and to princeton too he was class of 1909in the end he decided to be a doctor and went a year to the harvard medical school then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old french tradition of the family and argued me into sending him across to the sorbonne i didand proudly enough though i knew how lonely id be with him so far off would to god i hadnt i thought he was the safest kind of a boy to be in paris he had a room in the rue st jacquesthats near the university in the latin quarterbut according to his letters and his friends he didnt cut up with the gayer dogs at all the people he knew were mostly young fellows from homeserious students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking attitudes and painting the town redbut of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing line between serious studies and the devil the aesthetesthe decadents you know experimenters in life and sensationthe baudelaire kind of a chap naturally denis ran up against a good many of these and saw a good deal of their life they had all sorts of crazy circles and cultsimitation devilworship fake black masses and the like doubt if it did them much harm on the wholeprobably most of em forgot all about it in a year or two one of the deepest in this queer stuff was a fellow denis had known at schoolfor that matter whose father id known myself frank marsh of new orleans disciple of lafcadio hearn and gauguin and van goghregular epitome of the yellow nineties poor devilhe had the makings of a great artist at thatmarsh was the oldest friend denis had in paris so as a matter of course they saw a good deal of each otherto talk over old times at st clair academy and all that the boy wrote me a good deal about him and i didnt see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of mystics marsh ran with it seems there was some cult of prehistoric egyptian and carthaginian magic having a rage among the bohemian element on the left banksome nonsensical thing that pretended to reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost african civilisationsthe great zimbabwe the dead atlantean cities in the hoggar region of the saharaand that had a lot of gibberish connected with snakes and human hair at least i called it gibberish then denis used to quote marsh as saying odd things about the veiled facts behind the legend of medusas snaky locksand behind the later ptolemaic myth of berenice who offered up her hair to save her husbandbrother and had it set in the sky as the constellation coma berenicesi dont think this business made much impression on denis until the night of the queer ritual at marshs rooms when he met the priestess most of the devotees of this cult were young fellows but the head of it was a young woman who called herself tanitisisletting it be known that her real nameher name in this latest incarnation as she put itwas marceline bedard she claimed to be the lefthanded daughter of marquis de chameaux and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an artists model before adopting this more lucrative magical game someone said she had lived for a time in the west indiesmartinique i thinkbut she was very reticent about herself part of her pose was a great show of austerity and holiness but i dont think the more experienced students took that very seriouslydenis though was far from experienced and wrote me fully ten pages of slush about the goddess he had discovered if id only realised his simplicity i might have done something but i never thought a puppy infatuation like that could mean much i felt absurdly sure that denis touchy personal honour and family pride would always keep him out of the most serious complicationsas time went on though his letters began to make me nervous he mentioned this marceline more and more and his friends less and less and began talking about the cruel and silly way they declined to introduce her to their mothers and sisters he seems to have asked her no questions about herself and i dont doubt but that she filled him full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations and the way people slighted her at length i could see that denis was altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with this alluring priestess at her especial request he never told the old crowd of their continual meetings so nobody over there tried to break the affair upi suppose she thought he was fabulously rich for he had the air of a patrician and people of a certain class think all aristocratic americans are wealthy in any case she probably thought this a rare chance to contract a genuine righthanded alliance with a really eligible young man by the time my nervousness burst into open advice it was too late the boy had lawfully married her and wrote that he was dropping his studies and bringing the woman home to riverside he said she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult and that henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewomanthe future mistress of riverside and mother of de russys to comewell sir i took it the best way i could i knew that sophisticated continentals have different standards from our old american onesand anyway i really knew nothing against the woman a charlatan perhaps but why necessarily any worse i suppose i tried to keep as naive as possible about such things in those days for the boys sake clearly there was nothing for a man of sense to do but to let denis alone so long as his new wife conformed to de russy ways let her have a chance to prove herselfperhaps she wouldnt hurt the family as much as some might fear so i didnt raise any objections or ask any penitence the thing was done and i stood ready to welcome the boy back whatever he brought with himthey got here three weeks after the telegram telling of the marriage marceline was beautifulthere was no denying thatand i could see how the boy might very well get foolish about her she did have an air of breeding and i think to this day she must have had some strains of good blood in her she was apparently not much over twenty of medium size fairly slim and as graceful as a tigress in posture and motions her complexion was a deep olivelike old ivoryand her eyes were large and very dark she had small classically regular featuresthough not quite cleancut enough to suit my tasteand the most singular head of jet black hair that i ever sawi didnt wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical cult for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to her naturally coiled up it made her look like some oriental princess in a drawing of aubrey beardsleys hanging down her back it came well below her knees and shone in the light as if it had possessed some separate unholy vitality of its own i would almost have thought of medusa or berenice myselfwithout having such things suggested to meupon seeing and studying that hairsometimes i thought it moved slightly of itself and tended to arrange itself in distinct ropes or strands but this may have been sheer illusion she brushed it incessantly and seemed to use some sort of preparation on it i got the notion oncea curious whimsical notionthat it was a living thing which she had to feed in some strange way all nonsensebut it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her hairfor i cant deny that i failed to like her wholly no matter how hard i tried i couldnt tell what the trouble was but it was there something about her repelled me very subtly and i could not help weaving morbid and macabre associations about everything connected with her her complexion called up thoughts of babylon atlantis lemuria and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder world her eyes struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature or animalgoddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human and her hairthat dense exotic overnourished growth of oily inkinessmade one shiver as a great black python might have done there was no doubt but that she realised my involuntary attitudethough i tried to hide it and she tried to hide the fact that she noticed ityet the boys infatuation lasted he positively fawned on her and overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree she appeared to return the feeling though i could see it took a conscious effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and extravagances for one thing i think she was piqued to learn that we werent as wealthy as she had expectedit was a bad business all told i could see that sad undercurrents were arising denis was halfhypnotised with puppylove and began to grow away from me as he felt my shrinking from his wife this kind of thing went on for months and i saw that i was losing my only sonthe boy who had formed the centre of all my thoughts and acts for the past quarter century ill own that i felt bitter about itwhat father wouldnt and yet i could do nothingmarceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months and our friends received her without any quibbling or questioning i was always nervous though about what some of the young fellows in paris might write home to their relatives after the news of the marriage spread around despite the womans love of secrecy it couldnt remain hidden foreverindeed denis had written a few of his closest friends in strict confidence as soon as he was settled with her at riversidei got to staying alone in my room more and more with my failing health as an excuse it was about that time that my present spinal neuritis began to developwhich made the excuse a pretty good one denis didnt seem to notice the trouble or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs and it hurt me to see how callous he was getting i began to get sleepless and often racked my brain in the night to try to find out what really was the matterwhat it really was that made my new daughterinlaw so repulsive and even dimly horrible to me it surely wasnt her old mystical nonsense for she had left all the past behind her and never mentioned it once she didnt even do any painting although i understood that she had once dabbled in artoddly the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants the darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward her and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our family had left these fewold scipio and his wife sarah the cook delilah and mary scipios daughterwere as civil as possible but plainly revealed that their new mistress commanded their duty rather than their affection they stayed in their own remote part of the house as much as possible mccabe our white chauffeur was insolently admiring rather than hostile and another exception was a very old zulu woman said to have come from africa over a hundred years before who had been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of family pensioner old sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever marceline came near her and one time i saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had walked blacks are superstitious animals and i wondered whether marceline had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome their evident dislikeiiiwell thats how we went on for nearly half a year then in the summer of 1916 things began to happen toward the middle of june denis got a note from his old friend frank marsh telling of a sort of nervous breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country it was postmarked new orleansfor marsh had gone home from paris when he felt the collapse coming onand seemed a very plain though polite bid for an invitation from us marsh of course knew that marceline was here and asked very courteously after her denis was sorry to hear of his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visitmarsh cameand i was shocked to notice how he had changed since i had seen him in his earlier days he was a smallish lightish fellow with blue eyes and an undecided chin and now i could see the effects of drink and i dont know what else in his puffy eyelids enlarged nosepores and heavy lines around the mouth i reckon he had taken his pose of decadence pretty seriously and set out to be as much of a rimbaud baudelaire or lautramont as he could and yet he was delightful to talk tofor like all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the colour and atmosphere and names of things admirably thoroughly alive and with whole records of conscious experience in obscure shadowy fields of living and feeling which most of us pass over without knowing they exist poor young devilif only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand there was great stuff in the boyi was glad of the visit for i felt it would help to set up a normal atmosphere in the house again and thats what it really seemed to do at first for as i said marsh was a delight to have around he was as sincere and profound an artist as i ever saw in my life and i certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the perception and expression of beauty when he saw an exquisite thing or was creating one his eyes would dilate until the light irises went nearly out of sightleaving two mystical black pits in that weak delicate chalklike face black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess aboutwhen he reached here though he didnt have many chances to shew this tendency for he had as he told denis gone quite stale it seems he had been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kindlike fuseli or goya or sime or clark ashton smithbut had suddenly become played out the world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he could recognise as beautybeauty that is of enough force and poignancy to arouse his creative faculty he had often been this way beforeall decadents arebut this time he could not invent any new strange or outr sensation or experience which would supply the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy he was like a durtal or a des esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbitmarceline was away when marsh arrived she hadnt been enthusiastic about his coming and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our friends in st louis which came about that time for her and denis denis of course stayed to receive his guest but marceline had gone on alone it was the first time they had ever been separated and i hoped the interval would help to dispel the sort of daze that was making such a fool of the boy marceline shewed no hurry to get back but seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could denis stood it better than one would have expected from such a doting husband and seemed more like his old self as he talked over other days with marsh and tried to cheer the listless aesthete upit was marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman perhaps because he thought her strange beauty or some phase of the mysticism which had gone into her onetime magical cult might help to reawaken his interest in things and give him another start toward artistic creation that there was no baser reason i was absolutely certain from what i knew of marshs character with all his weaknesses he was a gentlemanand it had indeed relieved me when i first learned that he wanted to come here because his willingness to accept denis hospitality proved that there was no reason why he shouldntwhen at last marceline did return i could see that marsh was tremendously affected he did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre thing which she had so definitely abandoned but was unable to hide a powerful admiration which kept his eyesnow dilated in that curious way for the first time during his visitriveted to her every moment she was in the room she however seemed uneasy rather than pleased by his steady scrutinythat is she seemed so at first though this feeling of hers wore away in a few days and left the two on a basis of the most cordial and voluble congeniality i could see marsh studying her constantly when he thought no one was watching and i wondered how long it would be that only the artist and not the primitive man would be aroused by her mysterious gracesdenis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs though he realised that his guest was a man of honour and that as kindred mystics and aesthetes marceline and marsh would naturally have things and interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person could have no part he didnt hold anything against anybody but merely regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to let him talk with marceline as marsh talked at this stage of things i began to see more of the boy with his wife otherwise busy he had time to remember that he had a fatherand a father who was ready to help him in any sort of perplexity or difficultywe often sat together on the veranda watching marsh and marceline as they rode up or down the drive on horseback or played tennis on the court that used to stretch south of the house they talked mostly in french which marsh though he hadnt more than a quarterportion of french blood handled more glibly than either denis or i could speak it marcelines english always academically correct was rapidly improving in accent but it was plain that she relished dropping back into her mothertongue as we looked at the congenial couple they made i could see the boys cheek and throat muscles tightenthough he wasnt a whit less ideal a host to marsh or a whit less considerate a husband to marcelineall this was generally in the afternoon for marceline rose very late had breakfast in bed and took an immense amount of time preparing to come downstairs i never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics beauty exercises hairoils unguents and everything of that kind it was in these morning hours that denis and marsh did their real visiting and exchanged the close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy imposedwell it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made the proposition which brought on the end i was laid up with some of my neuritis but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlour sofa near the long window denis and marsh were just outside so i couldnt help hearing all they said they had been talking about art and the curious capricious environmental elements needed to jolt an artist into producing the real article when marsh suddenly swerved from abstractions to the personal application he must have had in mind from the starti suppose he was saying that nobody can tell just what it is in some scenes or objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain individuals basically of course it must have some reference to each mans background of storedup mental associations for no two people have the same scale of sensitiveness and responses we decadents are artists for whom all ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or imaginative significance but no one of us responds in the same way to exactly the same extraordinary thing now take me for instance he paused and resumedi know denny that i can say these things to you because you have such a preternaturally unspoiled mindclean fine direct objective and all that you wont misunderstand as an oversubtilised effete man of the world mighthe paused once morethe fact is i think i know whats needed to set my imagination working again ive had a dim idea of it ever since we were in paris but im sure now its marceline old chapthat face and that hair and the train of shadowy images they bring up not merely visible beautythough god knows theres enough of thatbut something peculiar and individualised that cant exactly be explained do you know in the last few days ive felt the existence of such a stimulus so keenly that i honestly think i could outdo myselfbreak into the real masterpiece class if i could get hold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and hair set my fancy stirring and weaving theres something weird and otherworldly about itsomething joined up with the dim ancient thing marceline represents i dont know how much shes told you about that side of her but i can assure you theres plenty of it she has some marvellous links with the outside some change in denis expression must have halted the speaker here for there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on i was utterly taken aback for id expected no such overt development like this and i wondered what my son could be thinking my heart began to pound violently and i strained my ears in the frankest of intentional eavesdropping then marsh resumedof course youre jealousi know how a speech like mine must soundbut i can swear to you that you neednt bedenis did not answer and marsh went onto tell the truth i could never be in love with marcelinei couldnt even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense why damn it all i felt like a hypocrite talking with her these days as ive been doingthe case simply is that one phase of her half hypnotises me in a certain waya very strange fantastic and dimly terrible wayjust as another phase half hypnotises you in a much more normal way i see something in heror to be psychologically exact something through her or beyond herthat you dont see at all something that brings up a vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses and makes me want to paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant i try to envisage them clearly dont mistake denny your wife is a magnificent being a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called divine if anything on earth hasi felt a clearing of the situation at this point for the abstract strangeness of marshs expressed statement plus the flattery he was now heaping on marceline could not fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his consort as denis always was marsh evidently caught the change himself for there was more confidence in his tone as he continuedi must paint her dennymust paint that hairand you wont regret it theres something more than mortal about that hairsomething more than beautifulhe paused and i wondered what denis could be thinking i wondered indeed what i was really thinking myself was marshs interest actually that of the artist alone or was he merely infatuated as denis had been i had thought in their schooldays that he had envied my boy and i dimly felt that it might be the same now on the other hand something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung amazingly true so that the more i pondered the more i was inclined to take the stuff at face value denis seemed to do so too for although i could not catch his lowspoken reply i could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been affirmativethere was a sound of someone slapping another on the back and then a grateful speech from marsh that i was long to rememberthats great denny and just as i told you youll never regret it in a sense im half doing it for you youll be a different man when you see it ill put you back where you used to begive you a wakingup and a sort of salvationbut you cant see what i mean as yet just remember old friendship and dont get the idea that im not the same old birdi rose perplexedly as i saw the two stroll off across the lawn arm in arm and smoking in unison what could marsh have meant by his strange and almost ominous reassurance the more my fears were quieted in one direction the more they were aroused in another look at it in any way i could it seemed to be rather a bad businessbut matters got started just the same denis fixed up an attic room with skylights and marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment everyone was rather excited about the new venture and i was at least glad that something was on foot to break the brooding tension soon the sittings began and we all took them quite seriouslyfor we could see that marsh regarded them as important artistic events denny and i used to go quietly about the house as though something sacred were occurring and we knew that it was sacred so far as marsh was concernedwith marceline though it was a different matter as i began to see at once whatever marshs reactions to the sittings may have been hers were painfully obvious every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace infatuation for the artist and would repulse denis marks of affection whenever she dared oddly i noticed this more vividly than denis himself and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boys mind easy until the matter could be straightened out there was no use in having him excited about it if it could be helpedin the end i decided that denis had better be away while the disagreeable situation existed i could represent his interests well enough at this end and sooner or later marsh would finish the picture and go my view of marshs honour was such that i did not look for any worse developments when the matter had blown over and marceline had forgotten about her new infatuation it would be time enough to have denis on hand againso i wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in new york and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite time i had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one of us to go east and of course my illness made it clear that i could not be the one it was arranged that when denis got to new york he would find enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as i thought he ought to be awaythe plan worked perfectly and denis started for new york without the least suspicion marceline and marsh going with him in the car to cape girardeau where he caught the afternoon train to st louis they returned about dark and as mccabe drove the car back to the stables i could hear them talking on the verandain those same chairs near the long parlour window where marsh and denis had sat when i overheard them talk about the portrait this time i resolved to do some intentional eavesdropping so quietly went down to the front parlour and stretched out on the sofa near the windowat first i could not hear anything but very shortly there came a sound as of a chair being shifted followed by a short sharp breath and a sort of inarticulately hurt exclamation from marceline then i heard marsh speaking in a strained almost formal voiceid enjoy working tonight if youre not too tiredmarcelines reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her exclamation she used english as he had doneoh frank is that really all you care about forever working cant we just sit out in this glorious moonlighthe answered impatiently his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the dominant quality of artistic enthusiasmmoonlight good god what cheap sentimentality for a supposedly sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap that ever escaped from the dime novels with art at your elbow you have to think of the mooncheap as a spotlight at the varieties or perhaps it makes you think of the roodmas dance around the stone pillars at auteuil hell how you used to make those goggleeyed yaps stare but noi suppose youve dropped all that now no more atlantean magic or hairsnake rites for madame de russy im the only one to remember the old thingsthe things that came down through the temples of tanit and echoed on the ramparts of zimbabwe but i wont be cheated of that remembranceall that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvasthe thing that is going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of 75000 years marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotionsits you who are cheaply sentimental now you know well that the old things had better be let alone all of you had better look out if ever i chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in yuggoth zimbabwe and rlyeh i thought you had more senseyou lack logic you want me to be interested in this precious painting of yours yet you never let me see what youre doing always that black cloth over it its of mei shouldnt think it would matter if i saw it marsh was interrupting this time his voice curiously hard and strainedno not now youll see it in due course of time you say its of youyes its that but its more if you knew you mightnt be so impatient poor denis my god its a shamemy throat went suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch what could marsh mean suddenly i saw that he had stopped and was entering the house alone i heard the front door slam and listened as his footsteps ascended the stairs outside on the veranda i could still hear marcelines heavy angry breathing i crept away sick at heart feeling that there were grave things to ferret out before i could safely let denis come backafter that evening the tension around the place was even worse than before marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock of those few blunt words from marsh was too much for her temperament there was no living in the house with her any more for with poor denis gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody when she could find no one indoors to quarrel with she would go out to sophonisbas cabin and spend hours talking with the queer old zulu woman aunt sophy was the only person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her and when i tried once to overhear their conversation i found marceline whispering about elder secrets and unknown kadath while the negress rocked to and fro in her chair making inarticulate sounds of reverence and admiration every now and thenbut nothing could break her doglike infatuation for marsh she would talk bitterly and sullenly to him yet was getting more and more obedient to his wishes it was very convenient for him since he now became able to make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting he tried to shew gratitude for this willingness but i thought i could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing beneath his careful politeness for my part i frankly hated marceline there was no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as mere dislike these days certainly i was glad denis was away his letters not nearly so frequent as i wished shewed signs of strain and worryas the middle of august went by i gathered from marshs remarks that the portrait was nearly done his mood seemed increasingly sardonic though marcelines temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing tickled her vanity i can still recall the day when marsh said hed have everything finished within a week marceline brightened up perceptibly though not without a venomous look at me it seemed as if her coiled hair visibly tightened about her headim to be the first to see it she snapped then smiling at marsh she said and if i dont like it i shall slash it to piecesmarshs face took on the most curious look i have ever seen it wear as he answered heri cant vouch for your taste marceline but i swear it will be magnificent not that i want to take much creditart creates itselfand this thing had to be done just waitduring the next few days i felt a queer sense of foreboding as if the completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief denis too had not written me and my agent in new york said he was planning some trip to the country i wondered what the outcome of the whole thing would be what a queer mixture of elementsmarsh and marceline denis and i how would all these ultimately react on one another when my fears grew too great i tried to lay them all to my infirmity but that explanation never quite satisfied meivwell the thing exploded on tuesday the twentysixth of august i had risen at my usual time and had breakfast but was not good for much because of the pain in my spine it had been troubling me badly of late and forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable nobody else was downstairs except the servants though i could hear marceline moving about in her room marsh slept in the attic next his studio and had begun to keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon about ten oclock the pain got the better of me so that i took a double dose of my opiate and lay down on the parlour sofa the last i heard was marcelines pacing overhead poor creatureif i had known she must have been walking before the long mirror admiring herself that was like her vain from start to finishrevelling in her own beauty just as she revelled in all the little luxuries denis was able to give heri didnt wake up till near sunset and knew instantly how long i had slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the long window nobody was about and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over everything from afar though i thought i could sense a faint howling wild and intermittent whose quality had a slight but baffling familiarity about it im not much for psychic premonitions but i was frightfully uneasy from the start there had been dreamseven worse than the ones i had been dreaming in the weeks beforeand this time they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality the whole place had a poisonous air afterward i reflected that certain sounds must have filtered through to my unconscious brain during those hours of drugged sleep my pain though was very much eased and i rose and walked without difficultysoon enough i began to see that something was wrong marsh and marceline might have been riding but someone ought to have been getting dinner in the kitchen instead there was only silence except for that faint distant howl or wail and nobody answered when i pulled the oldfashioned bellcord to summon scipio then chancing to look up i saw the spreading stain on the ceilingthe bright red stain that must have come through the floor of marcelines roomin an instant i forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out the worst everything under the sun raced through my mind as i struggled with the dampnesswarped door of that silent chamber and most hideous of all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness i had it struck me known all along that nameless horrors were gathering that something profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a foothold under my roof from which only blood and tragedy could resultthe door gave at last and i stumbled into the large room beyondall dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows for a moment i could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately struck my nostrils then turning on the electric light and glancing around i glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue rugit lay face down in a great pool of dark thickened blood and had the gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back blood was spattered everywhereon the walls furniture and floor my knees gave way as i took in the sight so that i had to stumble to a chair and slump down the thing had obviously been a human being though its identity was not easy to establish at first since it was without clothes and had most of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a very crude way it was of a deep ivory colour and i knew that it must have been marceline the shoeprint on the back made the thing seem all the more hellish i could not even picture the strange loathsome tragedy which must have taken place while i slept in the room below when i raised my hand to wipe my dripping forehead i saw that my fingers were sticky with blood i shuddered then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door which the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left he had taken his weapon with him it seemed for no instrument of death was visible hereas i studied the floor i saw that a line of sticky footprints like the one on the body led away from the horror to the door there was another bloodtrail too and of a less easily explainable kind a broadish continuous line as if marking the path of some huge snake at first i concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after him then noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be superimposed on it i was forced to believe that it had been there when the murderer left but what crawling entity could have been in that room with the victim and her assassin leaving before the killer when the deed was done as i asked myself this question i thought i heard fresh bursts of that faint distant wailingfinally rousing myself from a lethargy of horror i got on my feet again and began following the footprints who the murderer was i could not even faintly guess nor could i try to explain the absence of the servants i vaguely felt that i ought to go up to marshs attic quarters but before i had fully formulated the idea i saw that the bloody trail was indeed taking me there was he himself the murderer had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and suddenly run amokin the attic corridor the trail became faint the prints almost ceasing as they merged with the dark carpet i could still however discern the strange single path of the entity who had gone first and this led straight to the closed door of marshs studio disappearing beneath it at a point about half way from side to side evidently it had crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide opensick at heart i tried the knob and found the door unlocked opening it i paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be awaiting me there was certainly something human on the floor and i reached for the switch to turn on the chandelierbut as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horrorthat was marsh poor devilto fix itself frantically and incredulously upon the living thing that cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to marshs bedroom it was a tousled wildeyed thing crusted with dried blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall yet even in that awful moment i recognised it as one whom i had thought more than a thousand miles away it was my own boy denisor the maddened wreck which had once been denisthe sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanityor at least of memoryin the poor boy he straightened up and began to toss his head about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence i could not speak a word but moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice my eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in front of the heavily draped easelthe figure toward which the strange bloodtrail led and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some dark ropy object the shifting of my glance apparently produced some impression in the twisted brain of the boy for suddenly he began to mutter in a hoarse whisper whose purport i was soon able to catchi had to exterminate hershe was the devilthe summit and highpriestess of all evilthe spawn of the pitmarsh knew and tried to warn me good old franki didnt kill him though i was ready to before i realised but i went down there and killed herthen that cursed hairi listened in horror as denis choked paused and began againyou didnt knowher letters got queer and i knew she was in love with marsh then she nearly stopped writing he never mentioned heri felt something was wrong and thought i ought to come back and find out couldnt tell youyour manner would have given it away wanted to surprise them got here about noon todaycame in a cab and sent the houseservants all offlet the field hands alone for their cabins are all out of earshot told mccabe to get me some things in cape girardeau and not bother to come back till tomorrow had all the niggers take the old car and let mary drive them to bend village for a vacationtold em we were all going on some sort of outing and wouldnt need help said theyd better stay all night with uncle scips cousin who keeps that nigger boardinghousedenis was getting very incoherent now and i strained my ears to grasp every word again i thought i heard that wild faroff wail but the story had first place for the presentsaw you sleeping in the parlour and took a chance you wouldnt wake up then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up marsh and that womanthe boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing marcelines name at the same time i saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant crying whose vague familiarity had now become very greatshe was not in her room so i went up to the studio door was shut and i could hear voices inside didnt knockjust burst in and found her posing for the picture nude but with that hellish hair all draped around her and making all sorts of sheeps eyes at marsh he had the easel turned half away from the door so i couldnt see the picture both of them were pretty well jolted when i shewed up and marsh dropped his brush i was in a rage and told him hed have to shew me the portrait but he got calmer every minute told me it wasnt quite done but would be in a day or twosaid i could see it thenshehadnt seen itbut that didnt go with me i stepped up and he dropped a velvet curtain over the thing before i could see it he was ready to fight before letting me see it but thatthatshestepped up and sided with me said we ought to see it frank got horribly worked up and gave me a punch when i tried to get at the curtain i punched back and seemed to have knocked him out then i was almost knocked out myself by the shriek thatthat creaturegave shed drawn aside the hangings herself and had caught a look at what marsh had been painting i wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the roomthen i saw the picturemadness flared up in the boys eyes again as he got to this place and i thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete but after a pause he partly steadied himselfoh godthat thing dont ever look at it burn it with the hangings around it and throw the ashes into the river marsh knewand was warning me he knew what it waswhat that womanthat leopardess or gorgon or lamia or whatever she wasactually represented hed tried to hint to me ever since i met her in his paris studio but it couldnt be told in words i thought they all wronged her when they whispered horrors about hershe had me hypnotised so that i couldnt believe the plain factsbut this picture has caught the whole secretthe whole monstrous backgroundgod but frank is an artist that thing is the greatest piece of work any living soul has produced since rembrandt its a crime to burn itbut it would be a greater crime to let it existjust as it would have been an abhorrent sin to letthat shedaemonexist any longer the minute i saw it i understood whatshewas and what part she played in the frightful secret that has come down from the days of cthulhu and the elder onesthe secret that was nearly wiped out when atlantis sank but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and furtive midnight cultpractices for you know she was the real thing it wasnt any fake it would have been merciful if it had been a fake it was the old hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mentionthe thing hinted at in thenecronomiconand symbolised in the easter island colossishe thought we couldnt see throughthat the false front would hold till we had bartered away our immortal souls and she was half rightshed have got me in the end she was onlywaiting but frankgood old frankwas too much for mehe knew what it all meant and painted iti dont wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw it it wasnt quite done but god knowsenough was therethen i knew id got to kill herkill her and everything connected with her it was a taint that wholesome human blood couldnt bear there was something else toobut youll never know that if you burn the picture without looking i staggered down to her room with this machete that i got off the wall here leaving frank still knocked out he was breathing though and i knew and thanked heaven that i hadnt killed himi found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair she turned on me like a wild beast and began spitting out her hatred of marsh the fact that shed been in love with himand i knew she hadonly made it worse for a minute i couldnt move and she came within an ace of completely hypnotising me then i thought of the picture and the spell broke she saw the breaking in my eyes and must have noticed the machete too i never saw anything give such a wild jungle beast look as she did then she sprang for me with claws out like a leopards but i was too quick i swung the machete and it was all overdenis had to stop again there and i saw the perspiration running down his forehead through the spattered blood but in a moment he hoarsely resumedi said it was all overbut god some of it had only just begun i felt i had fought the legions of satan and put my foot on the back of the thing i had annihilatedthen i saw that blasphemous braid of coarse black hair begin to twist and squirm of itselfi might have known it it was all in the old tales that damnable hair had a life of its own that couldnt be ended by killing the creature itself i knew id have to burn it so i started to hack it off with the machete god but it was devilish work toughlike iron wiresbut i managed to do it and it was loathsome the way the big braid writhed and struggled in my graspabout the time i had the last strand cut or pulled off i heard that eldritch wailing from behind the house you knowits still going off and on i dont know what it is but it must be something springing from this hellish business it half seems like something i ought to know but cant quite place it got my nerves the first time i heard it and i dropped the severed braid in my fright then i got a worse frightfor in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of grotesque head i struck out with the machete and it turned away then when i had my breath again i saw that the monstrous thing was crawling along the floor by itself like a great black snake i couldnt do anything for a while but when it vanished through the door i managed to pull myself together and stumble after it i could follow the broad bloody trail and i saw it led upstairs it brought me hereand may heaven curse me if i didnt see it through the doorway striking at poor dazed marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck at me finally coiling around him as a python would he had begun to come to but that abominable serpent thing got him before he was on his feet i knew that all of that womans hatred was behind it but i hadnt the power to pull it off i tried but it was too much for me even the machete was no goodi couldnt swing it freely or it would have slashed frank to pieces so i saw those monstrous coils tightensaw poor frank crushed to death before my eyesand all the time that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fieldsthats all i pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope itll never be lifted the thing must be burnt i couldnt pry the coils off poor dead frankthey cling to him like a leach and seem to have lost their motion altogether its as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killedits clinging to himembracing him youll have to burn poor frank with itbut for gods sake dont forget to see it in ashes that and the picture they must both go the safety of the world demands that they godenis might have whispered more but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut us short for the first time we knew what it was for a westerly veering wind brought articulate words at last we ought to have known long before since sounds much like it had often come from the same source it was wrinkled sophonisba the ancient zulu witchwoman who had fawned on marceline keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of this nightmare tragedy we could both hear some of the things she howled and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of elder secrets who had just been extirpated some of the words she used betrayed her closeness to daemonic and palaeogean traditionsi i shubniggurath yarlyeh ngagi nbulu bwana nloloya yo pore missy tanit pore missy isis marse clooloo come up

yongagi nbulu bwana nlolo i shubniggurathshe daid ol sophy knowthat wasnt the end of the wailing but it was all i could pay attention to the expression on my boys face shewed that it had reminded him of something frightful and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded no good i knew he was desperate and sprang to disarm him if possible before he could do anything morebut i was too late an old man with a bad spine doesnt count for much physically there was a terrible struggle but he had done for himself before many seconds were over im not sure yet but that he tried to kill me too his last panting words were something about the need of wiping out everything that had been connected with marceline either by blood or marriagevi wonder to this day that i didnt go stark mad in that instantor in the moments and hours afterward in front of me was the slain body of my boythe only human being i had to cherishand ten feet away in front of that shrouded easel was the body of his best friend with a nameless coil of horror wound around it below was the scalped corpse of that shemonster about whom i was halfready to believe anything i was too dazed to analyse the probability of the hair storyand even if i had not been that dismal howling from aunt sophys cabin would have been enough to quiet doubt for the nonceif id been wise id have done just what poor denis told me toburned the picture and the bodygrasping hair at once and without curiositybut i was too shaken to be wise i suppose i muttered foolish things over my boyand then i remembered that the night was wearing on and that the servants would be back in the morning it was plain that a matter like this could never be explained and i knew that i must cover things up and invent a storythat coil of hair around marsh was a monstrous thing as i poked at it with a sword which i took from the wall i almost thought i felt it tighten its grip on the dead man i didnt dare touch itand the longer i looked at it the more horrible things i noticed about it one thing gave me a start i wont mention itbut it partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as marceline had always donein the end i decided to bury all three bodies in the cellarwith quicklime which i knew we had in the storehouse it was a night of hellish work i dug three gravesmy boys a long way from the other two for i didnt want him to be near either the womans body or her hair i was sorry i couldnt get the coil from around poor marsh it was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar i used blankets in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him then i had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse god must have given me strength for i not only moved them both but filled all three graves without a hitchsome of the lime i made into whitewash i had to take a stepladder and fix over the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through and i burned nearly everything in marcelines room scrubbing the walls and floor and heavy furniture i washed up the attic studio too and the trail and footprints that led there and all the time i could hear old sophys wailing in the distance the devil must have been in that creature to let her voice go on like that but she always was howling queer things thats why the field niggers didnt get scared or curious that night i locked the studio door and took the key to my room then i burned all my stained clothes in the fireplace by dawn the whole house looked quite normal so far as any casual eye could tell i hadnt dared touch the covered easel but meant to attend to that laterwell the servants came back next day and i told them all the young folks had gone to st louis none of the field hands seemed to have seen or heard anything and old sophonisbas wailing had stopped at the instant of sunrise she was like a sphinx after that and never let out a word of what had been on her brooding witchbrain the day and night beforelater on i pretended that denis and marsh and marceline had gone back to paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from thereletters i had fixed up in forged handwriting it took a good deal of deceit and reticence to explain things to various friends and i know people have secretly suspected me of holding something back i had the deaths of marsh and denis reported during the war and later said marceline had entered a convent fortunately marsh was an orphan whose eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in louisiana things might have been patched up a good deal better for me if i had had the sense to burn the picture sell the plantation and give up trying to manage things with a shaken and overstrained mind you see what my folly has brought me to failing cropshands discharged one by oneplace falling to ruinand myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside stories nobody will come around here after dark nowadaysor any other time if it can be helped thats why i knew you must be a strangerand why do i stay here i cant wholly tell you that its bound up too closely with things at the very rim of sane reality it wouldnt have been so perhaps if i hadnt looked at the picture i ought to have done as poor denis told me i honestly meant to burn it when i went up to that locked studio a week after the horror but i looked firstand that changed everythingnotheres no use telling what i saw you can in a way see for yourself presently though time and dampness have done their work i dont think it can hurt you if you want to take a look but it was different with me i knew too much of what it all meantdenis had been rightit was the greatest triumph of human art since rembrandt even though still unfinished i grasped that at the start and knew that poor marsh had justified his decadent philosophy he was to painting what baudelaire was to poetryand marceline was the key that had unlocked his inmost stronghold of geniusthe thing almost stunned me when i pulled aside the hangingsstunned me before i half knew what the whole thing was you know its only partly a portrait marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he wasnt painting marceline alone but what he saw through her and beyond herof course she was in itwas the key to it in a sensebut her figure only formed one point in a vast composition she was nude except for that hideous web of hair spun around her and was halfseated halfreclining on a sort of bench or divan carved in patterns unlike those of any known decorative tradition there was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand from which was spilling fluid whose colour i havent been able to place or classify to this dayi dont know where marsh even got the pigmentsthe figure and the divan were in the lefthand foreground of the strangest sort of scene i ever saw in my life i think there was a faint suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the womans brain yet there was also a directly opposite suggestionas if she were just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itselfi cant tell you now whether its an exterior or an interiorwhether those hellish cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous arborescence the geometry of the whole thing is crazyone gets the acute and obtuse angles all mixed upand god the shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual daemon twilight the blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a witches sabbat with that woman as a highpriestess the black shaggy entities that are not quite goatsthe crocodileheaded beast with three legs and a dorsal row of tentaclesand the flatnosed aegipans dancing in a pattern that egypts priests knew and called accursedbut the scene wasnt egyptit wasbehindegypt behind even atlantis behind fabled mu and mythwhispered lemuria it was the ultimate fountainhead of all horror on this earth and the symbolism shewed only too clearly how integral a part of it marceline was i think it must be the unmentionable rlyeh that was not built by any creatures of this planetthe thing marsh and denis used to talk about in the shadows with hushed voices in the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep under waterthough everybody seems to be breathing freelywelli couldnt do anything but look and shudder and finally i saw that marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous dilated eyes on the canvas it was no mere superstitionmarsh had actually caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and colour so that she still brooded and stared and hated just as if most of her werent down in the cellar under quicklimeand it was worst of all when some of those hecateborn snaky strands of hair began to lift themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward methen it was that i knew the last final horror and realised i was a guardian and a prisoner forever she was the thing from which the first dim legends of medusa and the gorgons had sprung and something in my shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last never again would i be safe from those coiling snaky strandsthe strands in the picture and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine casks all too late i recalled the tales of the virtual indestructibility even through centuries of burial of the hair of the deadmy life since has been nothing but horror and slavery always there had lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar in less than a month the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that crawled around near the wine casks after dark and about the curious way its trail would lead to another spot six feet away finally i had to move everything to another part of the cellar for not a darky could be induced to go near the place where the snake was seenthen the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old sophonisbas cabin every night after midnight one of them shewed me its trailand not long afterward i found out that aunt sophy herself had begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house lingering and muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the other blacks would go near god but i was glad when that old witch died i honestly believe she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible tradition back in africa she must have lived to be almost a hundred and fifty years oldsometimes i think i hear something gliding around the house at night there will be a queer noise on the stairs where the boards are loose and the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure i always keep my door locked of course then there are certain mornings when i seem to catch a sickish musty odour in the corridors and notice a faint ropy trail through the dust of the floors i know i must guard the hair in the picture for if anything were to happen to it there are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible revenge i dont even dare to diefor life and death are all one to those in the clutch of what came out of rlyeh something would be on hand to punish my neglect medusas coil has got me and it will always be the same never mix up with secret and ultimate horror young man if you value your immortal soulvias the old man finished his story i saw that the small lamp had long since burned dry and that the large one was nearly empty it must i knew be near dawn and my ears told me that the storm was over the tale had held me in a halfdaze and i almost feared to glance at the door lest it reveal an inward pressure from some unnamable source it would be hard to say which had the greatest hold on mestark horror incredulity or a kind of morbid fantastic curiosity i was wholly beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to break the spelldo you want to seethe thinghis voice was very low and hesitant and i saw he was tremendously in earnest of my various emotions curiosity gained the upper hand and i nodded silently he rose lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high before him as he opened the doorcome with meupstairsi dreaded to brave those musty corridors again but fascination downed all my qualms the boards creaked beneath our feet and i trembled once when i thought i saw a faint ropelike line traced in the dust near the staircasethe steps of the attic were noisy and rickety with several of the treads missing i was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing for it gave me an excuse not to glance about the attic corridor was pitchblack and heavily cobwebbed and inchdeep with dust except where a beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther end as i noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet i thought of the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decadesof these and of one thing which did not have feetthe old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path and fumbled a second with the rusty latch i was acutely frightened now that i knew the picture was so close yet dared not retreat at this stage in another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted studiothe candle light was very faint yet served to shew most of the principal features i noticed the low slanting roof the huge enlarged dormer the curios and trophies hung on the wallsand most of all the great shrouded easel in the centre of the floor to that easel de russy now walked drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned away from me and motioning me silently to approach it took a good deal of courage to make me obey especially when i saw how my guides eyes dilated in the wavering candle light as he looked at the unveiled canvas but again curiosity conquered everything and i walked around to where de russy stood then i saw the damnable thingi did not faintthough no reader can possibly realise the effort it took to keep me from doing so i did cry out but stopped short when i saw the frightened look on the old mans face as i had expected the canvas was warped mouldy and scabrous from dampness and neglect but for all that i could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scenes morbid content and perverted geometryit was as the old man had saida vaulted columned hell of mingled black masses and witches sabbathsand what perfect completion could have added to it was beyond my power to guess decay had only increased the utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion for the parts most affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in natureor in that extracosmic realm that mocked naturewould be apt to decay or disintegratethe utmost horror of all of course was marcelineand as i saw the bloated discoloured flesh i formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure on the canvas had some obscure occult linkage with the figure which lay in quicklime under the cellar floor perhaps the lime had preserved the corpse instead of destroying itbut could it have preserved those black malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from their painted helland there was something else about the creature which i could not fail to noticesomething which de russy had not been able to put into words but which perhaps had something to do with denis wish to kill all those of his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her whether marsh knew or whether the genius in him painted it without his knowing none could say but denis and his father could not have known till they saw the picturesurpassing all in horror was the streaming black hairwhich covered the rotting bodybut which was itself not even slightly decayedall i had heard of it was amply verified it was nothing human this ropy sinuous halfoily halfcrinkly flood of serpent darkness vile independent life proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and convolution and the suggestion of numberlessreptilian headsat the outturned ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidentalthe blasphemous thing held me like a magnet i was helpless and did not wonder at the myth of the gorgons glance which turned all beholders to stone then i thought i saw a change come over the thing the leering features perceptibly moved so that the rotting jaw fell allowing the thick beastlike lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs the pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated and the eyes themselves seemed to bulge outward and the hairthat accursed hairit had begun to rustle and wave perceptibly the snakeheads all turning toward de russy and vibrating as if to strikereason deserted me altogether and before i knew what i was doing i drew my automatic and sent a shower of twelve steeljacketed bullets through the shocking canvas the whole thing at once fell to pieces even the frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the dustcovered floor but though this horror was shattered another had risen before me in the form of de russy himself whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as the picture itself had beenwith a halfarticulate scream of god now youve done it the frantic old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the room and down the rickety stairs he had dropped the candle in his panic but dawn was near and some faint grey light was filtering in through the dustcovered windows i tripped and stumbled repeatedly but never for a moment would my guide slacken his pacerun he shrieked run for your life you dont know what youve done i never told you the whole thing there were things i had to dothe picture talked to me and told mei had to guard and keep itnow the worst will happenshe and that hair will come up out of their graves for god knows what purposehurry man for gods sake lets get out of here while theres time if you have a car take me along to cape girardeau with you it may get me in the end anywhere but ill give it a run for its money out of herequickas we reached the ground floor i became aware of a slow curious thumping from the rear of the house followed by a sound of a door shutting de russy had not heard the thumping but the other noise caught his ear and drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throatoh godgreat godthat was the cellar doorshes comingby this time i was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging hinges of the great front dooralmost as frantic as my host now that i heard the slow thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of the accursed mansion the nights rain had warped the oaken planks and the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when i forced an entrance the evening beforesomewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking and the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man with a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a plunge to the right through the open door of a room which i judged had been a parlour a second later just as i got the front door open and was making my own escape i heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and knew he had leapt through a window and as i bounded off the sagging porch to commence my mad race down the long weedgrown drive i thought i could catch the thud of dead dogged footfalls which did not follow me but which kept leadenly on through the door of the cobwebbed parlouri looked backward only twice as i plunged heedlessly through the burrs and briers of that abandoned drive past the dying lindens and grotesque scruboaks in the grey pallor of a cloudy november dawn the first time was when an acrid smell overtook me and i thought of the candle de russy had dropped in the attic studio by then i was comfortably near the road on the high place from which the roof of the distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees and just as i expected thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and curling upward into the leaden heavens i thanked the powers of creation that an immemorial curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earthbut in the next instant came that second backward look in which i glimpsed two other thingsthings that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a supreme shock from which i shall never recover i have said that i was on a high part of the drive from which much of the plantation behind me was visible this vista included not only the house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly flooded flat land beside the river and several bends of the weedchoked drive i had been so hastily traversing in both of these latter places i now beheld sightsor suspicions of sightswhich i wish devoutly i could denyit was a faint distant scream which made me turn back again and as i did so i caught a trace of motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the house at that distance human figures are very small yet i thought the motion resolved itself into two of thesepursuer and pursued i even thought i saw the darkclothed leading figure overtaken and seized by the bald naked figure in the rearovertaken seized and dragged violently in the direction of the now burning housebut i could not watch the outcome for at once a nearer sight obtruded itselfa suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some distance back along the deserted driveunmistakably the weeds and bushes and briers were swaying as no wind could sway them swaying as if some large swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the ground in pursuit of methat was all i could stand i scrambled along madly for the gate heedless of torn clothing and bleeding scratches and jumped into the roadster parked under the great evergreen tree it was a bedraggled raindrenched sight but the works were unharmed and i had no trouble in starting the thing i went on blindly in the direction the car was headed for nothing was in my mind but to get away from that frightful region of nightmares and cacodaemonsto get away as quickly and as far as gasoline could take meabout three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed mea kindly drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence i was glad to slow down and ask directions though i knew i must present a strange enough aspect the man readily told me the way to cape girardeau and inquired where i had come from in such a state at such an early hour thinking it best to say little i merely mentioned that i had been caught in the nights rain and had taken shelter at a nearby farmhouse afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying to find my carat a farmhouse eh wonder whose it could a ben aint nothin standin this side o jim ferris place acrost barkers crick an thats all o twenty miles by the rudi gave a start and wondered what fresh mystery this portended then i asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house whose ancient gate bordered the road not far backfunny ye shd recolleck that stranger must a ben here afore some time but that house aint there now burnt down five or six years agoand they did tell some queer stories about iti shudderedyou mean riversideol man de russys place queer goins on there fifteen or twenty years ago ol mans boy married a gal from abroad and some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort didnt like the looks of her then she and the boy went off sudden and later on the ol man said he was kilt in the war but some o the niggers hinted queer things got around at last that the ol fellow fell in love with the gal himself and kilt her and the boy that place was sure enough haunted by a black snake mean that what it maythen five or six years ago the ol man disappeared and the house burned down some do say he was burnt up in it it was a mornin after a rainy night just like this when lots o folks heard an awful yellin acrost the fields in old de russys voice when they stopped and looked they see the house goin up in smoke quick as a winkthat place was all like tinder anyhow rain or no rain nobody never seen the ol man agin but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big black snake glidin arounwhat dye make of it anyhow you seem to hev knowed the place didnt ye ever hear tell of the de russys what dye reckon was the trouble with that gal young denis married she kinder made everybody shiver and feel hateful though ye couldnt never tell whyi was trying to think but that process was almost beyond me now the house burned down years ago then where and under what conditions had i passed the night and why did i know what i knew of these things even as i pondered i saw a hair on my coat sleevethe short grey hair of an old manin the end i drove on without telling anything but i did hint that gossip was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much i made it clearas if from distant but authentic reports wafted among friendsthat if anyone was to blame for the trouble at riverside it was the woman marceline she was not suited to missouri ways i said and it was too bad that denis had ever married hermore i did not intimate for i felt that the de russys with their proudly cherished honour and high sensitive spirits would not wish me to say more they had borne enough god knows without the countryside guessing what a daemon of the pitwhat a gorgon of the elder blasphemieshad come to flaunt their ancient and stainless namenor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell methat horror which he must have learned as i learned it from details in the lost masterpiece of poor frank marshit would be too hideous if they knew that the onetime heiress of riversidethe accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of serpenthair must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artists skeleton in a limepacked grave beneath a charred foundationwas faintly subtly yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of zimbabwes most primal grovellers no wonder she owned a link with that old witchwoman sophonisbafor though in deceitfully slight proportion marceline was a negress,1
in the valley of nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly tearing a path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great upastree and within the depths of the valley where the light reaches not move forms not meet to be beheld rank is the herbage on each slope where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten hands and in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes while in and out of deep treasurevaults writhe poison serpents and scaly things without a namevast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss and mighty were the walls from which they fell for all time did their builders erect them and in sooth they yet serve nobly for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitationat the very bottom of the valley lies the river than whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds from hidden springs it rises and to subterranean grottoes it flows so that the daemon of the valley knows not why its waters are red nor whither they are boundthe genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the daemon of the valley saying i am old and forget much tell me the deeds and aspect and name of them who built these things of stone and the daemon replied i am memory and am wise in lore of the past but i too am old these beings were like the waters of the river than not to be understood their deeds i recall not for they were but of the moment their aspect i recall dimly for it was like to that of the little apes in the trees their name i recall clearly for it rhymed with that of the river these beings of yesterday were called manso the genie flew back to the thin horned moon and the daemon looked intently at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling courtyard,1
somewhere to what remote and fearsome region i know not denys barry has gone i was with him the last night he lived among men and heard his screams when the thing came to him but all the peasants and police in county meath could never find him or the others though they searched long and far and now i shudder when i hear the frogs piping in swamps or see the moon in lonely placesi had known denys barry well in america where he had grown rich and had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy kilderry it was from kilderry that his father had come and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes men of his blood had once ruled over kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle but those days were very remote so that for generations the castle had been empty and decaying after he went to ireland barry wrote me often and told me how under his care the grey castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendour how the ivy was climbing slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea but in time there came troubles and the peasants ceased to bless him and fled away instead as from a doom and then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him for he was lonely in the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and labourers he had brought from the norththe bog was the cause of all these troubles as barry told me the night i came to the castle i had reached kilderry in the summer sunset as the gold of the sky lighted the green of the hills and groves and the blue of the bog where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened spectrally that sunset was very beautiful but the peasants at ballylough had warned me against it and said that kilderry had become accursed so that i almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the castle gilded with fire barrys motor had met me at the ballylough station for kilderry is off the railway the villagers had shunned the car and the driver from the north but had whispered to me with pale faces when they saw i was going to kilderry and that night after our reunion barry told me whythe peasants had gone from kilderry because denys barry was to drain the great bog for all his love of ireland america had not left him untouched and he hated the beautiful wasted space where peat might be cut and land opened up the legends and superstitions of kilderry did not move him and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help and then cursed him and went away to ballylough with their few belongings as they saw his determination in their place he sent for labourers from the north and when the servants left he replaced them likewise but it was lonely among strangers so barry had asked me to comewhen i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed for these fears were of the vaguest wildest and most absurd character they had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog and of a grim guardian spirit that dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet i had seen in the sunset there were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon and of chill winds when the night was warm of wraiths in white hovering over the waters and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy surface but foremost among the weird fancies and alone in its absolute unanimity was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass there were secrets said the peasants which must not be uncovered secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous years beyond history in thebook of invadersit is told that these sons of the greeks were all buried at tallaght but old men in kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moongoddess so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of nemed swept down from scythia in their thirty shipssuch were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave kilderry and when i heard them i did not wonder that denys barry had refused to listen he had however a great interest in antiquities and proposed to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained the white ruins on the islet he had often visited but though their age was plainly great and their contour very little like that of most ruins in ireland they were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory now the work of drainage was ready to begin and the labourers from the north were soon to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather and kill the tiny shellpaved streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with rushesafter barry had told me these things i was very drowsy for the travels of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the night a manservant shewed me to my room which was in a remote tower overlooking the village and the plain at the edge of the bog and the bog itself so that i could see from my windows in the moonlight the silent roofs from which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered the labourers from the north and too the parish church with its antique spire and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral just as i dropped to sleep i fancied i heard faint sounds from the distance sounds that were wild and half musical and stirred me with a weird excitement which coloured my dreams but when i awaked next morning i felt it had all been a dream for the visions i had seen were more wonderful than any sound of wild pipes in the night influenced by the legends that barry had related my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city in a green valley where marble streets and statues villas and temples carvings and inscriptions all spoke in certain tones the glory that was greece when i told this dream to barry we both laughed but i laughed the louder because he was perplexed about his labourers from the north for the sixth time they had all overslept waking very slowly and dazedly and acting as if they had not rested although they were known to have gone early to bed the night beforethat morning and afternoon i wandered alone through the sungilded village and talked now and then with idle labourers for barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage the labourers were not as happy as they might have been for most of them seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had yet which they tried in vain to remember i told them of my dream but they were not interested till i spoke of the weird sounds i thought i had heard then they looked oddly at me and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds tooin the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days i was glad for although i disliked to see the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart i had a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deepmatted peat might hide and that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end for upon the city in the valley i saw a pestilence descend and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of artemis on the high peak where the aged moonpriestess cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver headi have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm for some time i could not tell whether i was waking or sleeping for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears but when i saw on the floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed gothic window i decided i must be awake and in the castle at kilderry then i heard a clock from some remote landing below strike the hour of two and i knew i was awake yet still there came that monotonous piping from afar wild weird airs that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant maenalus it would not let me sleep and in impatience i sprang up and paced the floor only by chance did i go to the north window and look out upon the silent village and the plain at the edge of the bog i had no wish to gaze abroad for i wanted to sleep but the flutes tormented me and i had to do or see something how could i have suspected the thing i was to beholdthere in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle which no mortal having seen it could ever forget to the sound of reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there glided silently and eerily a mixed throng of swaying figures reeling through such a revel as the sicilians may have danced to demeter in the old days under the harvest moon beside the cyane the wide plain the golden moonlight the shadowy moving forms and above all the shrill monotonous piping produced an effect which almost paralysed me yet i noted amidst my fear that half of these tireless mechanical dancers were the labourers whom i had thought asleep whilst the other half were strange airy beings in white half indeterminate in nature but suggesting pale wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog i do not know how long i gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before i dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon out of which the high sun of morning aroused memy first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to denys barry but as i saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in what i thought i had seen i am given to strange phantasms yet am never weak enough to believe in them so on this occasion contented myself with questioning the labourers who slept very late and recalled nothing of the previous night save misty dreams of shrill sounds this matter of the spectral piping harassed me greatly and i wondered if the crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and haunt the visions of men later in the day i watched barry in the library poring over his plans for the great work which was to begin on the morrow and for the first time felt a touch of the same kind of fear that had driven the peasants away for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of ageold peat that these secrets should be brought to light seemed injudicious and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village i went so far as to talk casually to barry on the subject but did not dare continue after he gave his resounding laugh so i was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills and kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portentwhether the events of that night were of reality or illusion i shall never ascertain certainly they transcend anything we dream of in nature and the universe yet in no normal fashion can i explain those disappearances which were known to all men after it was over i retired early and full of dread and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower it was very dark for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane and would not rise till the small hours i thought as i lay there of denys barry and of what would befall that bog when the day came and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night take barrys car and drive madly to ballylough out of the menaced lands but before my fears could crystallise into action i had fallen asleep and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadowprobably it was the shrill piping that awaked me yet that piping was not what i noticed first when i opened my eyes i was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog where the waning moon would rise and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me but i had not looked for such a sight as now appeared light indeed glowed on the panels ahead but it was not any light that the moon gives terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the gothic window and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendour intense and unearthly my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light i kept my eyes from the window in panic fear and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape i remember seizing my revolver and hat but before it was over i had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other after a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright and i crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the villageover the bog was a deluge of flaring light scarlet and sinister and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet the aspect of that ruin i cannot describei must have been mad for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed splendid and columncinctured the flamereflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountaintop flutes shrieked and drums began to beat and as i watched in awe and terror i thought i saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence the effect was titanicaltogether unthinkableand i might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog there my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if i had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of nature for on the ghastly redlitten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before save in nightmareshalf gliding half floating in the air the whiteclad bogwraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance their waving translucent arms guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who followed doglike with blind brainless floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless daemonwill as the naiads neared the bog without altering their course a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain despite their distance below me i at once knew they were the servants brought from the north for i recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic the flutes piped horribly and again i heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog while the line of followers never checking their speed splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which i could barely see in the scarlet light and as the last pathetic straggler the fat cook sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool the flutes and the drums grew silent and the blinding red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out leaving the village of doom lone and desolate in the wan beams of a newrisen moonmy condition was now one of indescribable chaos not knowing whether i was mad or sane sleeping or waking i was saved only by a merciful numbness i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis latona demeter persephone and plouton all that i recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest superstitions i felt that i had witnessed the death of a whole village and knew i was alone in the castle with denys barry whose boldness had brought down a doom as i thought of him new terrors convulsed me and i fell to the floor not fainting but physically helpless then i felt the icy blast from the east window where the moon had risen and began to hear the shrieks in the castle far below me soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality which cannot be written of and which make me faint as i think of them all i can say is that they came from something i had known as a friendat some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the screaming must have roused me for my next impression is of racing madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard into the hideous night they found me at dawn wandering mindless near ballylough but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors i had seen or heard before what i muttered about as i came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight incidents of no significance yet which haunt me unceasingly when i am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlightas i fled from that accursed castle along the bogs edge i heard a new sound common yet unlike any i had heard before at kilderry the stagnant waters lately quite devoid of animal life now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in tones strangely out of keeping with their size they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light i followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog and saw the second of the things which drove my senses awaystretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the bog and upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen daemons crazed as i was i saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblancea nauseous unbelievable caricaturea blasphemous effigy of him who had been denys barry,1
iit is only within the last few years that most people have stopped thinking of the west as anewland i suppose the idea gained ground because our own especial civilisation happens to be new there but nowadays explorers are digging beneath the surface and bringing up whole chapters of life that rose and fell among these plains and mountains before recorded history began we think nothing of a pueblo village 2500 years old and it hardly jolts us when archaeologists put the subpedregal culture of mexico back to 17000 or 18000 b c we hear rumours of still older things tooof primitive man contemporaneous with extinct animals and known today only through a few fragmentary bones and artifactsso that the idea of newness is fading out pretty rapidly europeans usually catch the sense of immemorial ancientness and deep deposits from successive lifestreams better than we do only a couple of years ago a british author spoke of arizona as a moondim region very lovely in its way and stark and oldan ancient lonely landyet i believe i have a deeper sense of the stupefyingalmost horribleancientness of the west than any european it all comes from an incident that happened in 1928 an incident which id greatly like to dismiss as threequarters hallucination but which has left such a frightfully firm impression on my memory that i cant put it off very easily it was in oklahoma where my work as an american indian ethnologist constantly takes me and where i had come upon some devilishly strange and disconcerting matters before make no mistakeoklahoma is a lot more than a mere pioneers and promoters frontier there are old old tribes with old old memories there and when the tomtoms beat ceaselessly over brooding plains in the autumn the spirits of men are brought dangerously close to primal whispered things i am white and eastern enough myself but anybody is welcome to know that the rites of yig father of snakes can get a real shudder out of me any day i have heard and seen too much to be sophisticated in such matters and so it is with this incident of 1928 id like to laugh it offbut i canti had gone into oklahoma to track down and correlate one of the many ghost tales which were current among the white settlers but which had strong indian corroboration andi felt surean ultimate indian source they were very curious these openair ghost tales and though they sounded flat and prosaic in the mouths of the white people they had earmarks of linkage with some of the richest and obscurest phases of native mythology all of them were woven around the vast lonely artificiallooking mounds in the western part of the state and all of them involved apparitions of exceedingly strange aspect and equipmentthe commonest and among the oldest became quite famous in 1892 when a government marshal named john willis went into the mound region after horsethieves and came out with a wild yarn of nocturnal cavalry horses in the air between great armies of invisible spectresbattles that involved the rush of hooves and feet the thud of blows the clank of metal on metal the muffled cries of warriors and the fall of human and equine bodies these things happened by moonlight and frightened his horse as well as himself the sounds persisted an hour at a time vivid but subdued as if brought from a distance by a wind and unaccompanied by any glimpse of the armies themselves later on willis learned that the seat of the sounds was a notoriously haunted spot shunned by settlers and indians alike many had seen or half seen the warring horsemen in the sky and had furnished dim ambiguous descriptions the settlers described the ghostly fighters as indians though of no familiar tribe and having the most singular costumes and weapons they even went so far as to say that they could not be sure the horses were really horsesthe indians on the other hand did not seem to claim the spectres as kinsfolk they referred to them as those people the old people or they who dwell below and appeared to hold them in too great a frightened veneration to talk much about them no ethnologist had been able to pin any taleteller down to a specific description of the beings and apparently nobody had ever had a very clear look at them the indians had one or two old proverbs about these phenomena saying that men very old make very big spirit not so old not so big older than all time then spirit he so big he near flesh those old people and spirits they mix upget all the samenow all of this of course is old stuff to an ethnologistof a piece with the persistent legends of rich hidden cities and buried races which abound among the pueblo and plains indians and which lured coronado centuries ago on his vain search for the fabled quivira what took me into western oklahoma was something far more definite and tangiblea local and distinctive tale which though really old was wholly new to the outside world of research and which involved the first clear descriptions of the ghosts which it treated of there was an added thrill in the fact that it came from the remote town of binger in caddo county a place i had long known as the scene of a very terrible and partly inexplicable occurrence connected with the snakegod myththe tale outwardly was an extremely naive and simple one and centred in a huge lone mound or small hill that rose above the plain about a third of a mile west of the villagea mound which some thought a product of nature but which others believed to be a burialplace or ceremonial dais constructed by prehistoric tribes this mound the villagers said was constantly haunted by two indian figures which appeared in alternation an old man who paced back and forth along the top from dawn till dusk regardless of the weather and with only brief intervals of disappearance and a squaw who took his place at night with a blueflamed torch that glimmered quite continuously till morning when the moon was bright the squaws peculiar figure could be seen fairly plainly and over half the villagers agreed that the apparition was headlesslocal opinion was divided as to the motives and relative ghostliness of the two visions some held that the man was not a ghost at all but a living indian who had killed and beheaded a squaw for gold and buried her somewhere on the mound according to these theorists he was pacing the eminence through sheer remorse bound by the spirit of his victim which took visible shape after dark but other theorists more uniform in their spectral beliefs held that both man and woman were ghosts the man having killed the squaw and himself as well at some very distant period these and minor variant versions seemed to have been current ever since the settlement of the wichita country in 1889 and were i was told sustained to an astonishing degree by stillexisting phenomena which anyone might observe for himself not many ghost tales offer such free and open proof and i was very eager to see what bizarre wonders might be lurking in this small obscure village so far from the beaten path of crowds and from the ruthless searchlight of scientific knowledge so in the late summer of 1928 i took a train for binger and brooded on strange mysteries as the cars rattled timidly along their single track through a lonelier and lonelier landscapebinger is a modest cluster of frame houses and stores in the midst of a flat windy region full of clouds of red dust there are about 500 inhabitants besides the indians on a neighbouring reservation the principal occupation seeming to be agriculture the soil is decently fertile and the oil boom has not reached this part of the state my train drew in at twilight and i felt rather lost and uneasycut off from wholesome and everyday thingsas it puffed away to the southward without me the station platform was filled with curious loafers all of whom seemed eager to direct me when i asked for the man to whom i had letters of introduction i was ushered along a commonplace main street whose rutted surface was red with the sandstone soil of the country and finally delivered at the door of my prospective host those who had arranged things for me had done well for mr compton was a man of high intelligence and local responsibility while his motherwho lived with him and was familiarly known as grandma comptonwas one of the first pioneer generation and a veritable mine of anecdote and folklorethat evening the comptons summed up for me all the legends current among the villagers proving that the phenomenon i had come to study was indeed a baffling and important one the ghosts it seems were accepted almost as a matter of course by everyone in binger two generations had been born and grown up within sight of that queer lone tumulus and its restless figures the neighbourhood of the mound was naturally feared and shunned so that the village and the farms had not spread toward it in all four decades of settlement yet venturesome individuals had several times visited it some had come back to report that they saw no ghosts at all when they neared the dreaded hill that somehow the lone sentinel had stepped out of sight before they reached the spot leaving them free to climb the steep slope and explore the flat summit there was nothing up there they saidmerely a rough expanse of underbrush where the indian watcher could have vanished to they had no idea he must they reflected have descended the slope and somehow managed to escape unseen along the plain although there was no convenient cover within sight at any rate there did not appear to be any opening into the mound a conclusion which was reached after considerable exploration of the shrubbery and tall grass on all sides in a few cases some of the more sensitive searchers declared that they felt a sort of invisible restraining presence but they could describe nothing more definite than that it was simply as if the air thickened against them in the direction they wished to move it is needless to mention that all these daring surveys were conducted by day nothing in the universe could have induced any human being white or red to approach that sinister elevation after dark and indeed no indian would have thought of going near it even in the brightest sunlightbut it was not from the tales of these sane observant seekers that the chief terror of the ghostmound sprang indeed had their experience been typical the phenomenon would have bulked far less prominently in the local legendry the most evil thing was the fact that many other seekers had come back strangely impaired in mind and body or had not come back at all the first of these cases had occurred in 1891 when a young man named heaton had gone with a shovel to see what hidden secrets he could unearth he had heard curious tales from the indians and had laughed at the barren report of another youth who had been out to the mound and had found nothing heaton had watched the mound with a spy glass from the village while the other youth made his trip and as the explorer neared the spot he saw the sentinel indian walk deliberately down into the tumulus as if a trapdoor and staircase existed on the top the other youth had not noticed how the indian disappeared but had merely found him gone upon arriving at the moundwhen heaton made his own trip he resolved to get to the bottom of the mystery and watchers from the village saw him hacking diligently at the shrubbery atop the mound then they saw his figure melt slowly into invisibility not to reappear for long hours till after the dusk drew on and the torch of the headless squaw glimmered ghoulishly on the distant elevation about two hours after nightfall he staggered into the village minus his spade and other belongings and burst into a shrieking monologue of disconnected ravings he howled of shocking abysses and monsters of terrible carvings and statues of inhuman captors and grotesque tortures and of other fantastic abnormalities too complex and chimerical even to remember old old old he would moan over and over again great god they are older than the earth and came here from somewhere elsethey

died in an epileptic fit since his ordeal there had been two more cases of moundmadness and eight of total disappearance immediately after heatons mad return three desperate and determined men had gone out to the lone hill together heavily armed and with spades and pickaxes watching villagers saw the indian ghost melt away as the explorers drew near and afterward saw the men climb the mound and begin scouting around through the underbrush all at once they faded into nothingness and were never seen again one watcher with an especially powerful telescope thought he saw other forms dimly materialise beside the hapless men and drag them down into the mound but this account remained uncorroborated it is needless to say that no searchingparty went out after the lost ones and that for many years the mound was wholly unvisited only when the incidents of 1891 were largely forgotten did anybody dare to think of further explorations then about 1910 a fellow too young to recall the old horrors made a trip to the shunned spot and found nothing at allby 1915 the acute dread and wild legendry of 91 had largely faded into the commonplace and unimaginative ghosttales at present survivingthat is had so faded among the white people on the nearby reservation were old indians who thought much and kept their own counsel about this time a second wave of active curiosity and adventuring developed and several bold searchers made the trip to the mound and returned then came a trip of two eastern visitors with spades and other apparatusa pair of amateur archaeologists connected with a small college who had been making studies among the indians no one watched this trip from the village but they never came back the searchingparty that went out after themamong whom was my host clyde comptonfound nothing whatsoever amiss at the moundthe next trip was the solitary venture of old capt lawton a grizzled pioneer who had helped to open up the region in 1889 but who had never been there since he had recalled the mound and its fascination all through the years and being now in comfortable retirement resolved to have a try at solving the ancient riddle long familiarity with indian myth had given him ideas rather stranger than those of the simple villagers and he had made preparations for some extensive delving he ascended the mound on the morning of thursday may 11 1916 watched through spy glasses by more than twenty people in the village and on the adjacent plain his disappearance was very sudden and occurred as he was hacking at the shrubbery with a brushcutter no one could say more than that he was there one moment and absent the next for over a week no tidings of him reached binger and thenin the middle of the nightthere dragged itself into the village the object about which dispute still ragesit said it wasor had beencapt lawton but it was definitely younger by as much as forty years than the old man who had climbed the mound its hair was jet black and its facenow distorted with nameless frightfree from wrinkles but it did remind grandma compton most uncannily of the captain as he had looked back in 89 its feet were cut off neatly at the ankles and the stumps were smoothly healed to an extent almost incredible if the being really were the man who had walked upright a week before it babbled of incomprehensible things and kept repeating the name george lawton george e lawton as if trying to reassure itself of its own identity the things it babbled of grandma compton thought were curiously like the hallucinations of poor young heaton in 91 though there were minor differences the blue lightthe blue light muttered the object always down there before there were any living thingsolder than the dinosaursalways the

materialists and feared nothing in heaven or earth and they thought that some indian fiends had a secret headquarters inside the mound they had been to the mound before and now they went again to avenge old capt lawtonboasting that theyd do it if they had to tear the mound down altogether clyde compton watched them with a pair of prism binoculars and saw them round the base of the sinister hill evidently they meant to survey their territory very gradually and minutely minutes passed and they did not reappear nor were they ever seen againonce more the mound was a thing of panic fright and only the excitement of the great war served to restore it to the farther background of binger folklore it was unvisited from 1916 to 1919 and would have remained so but for the daredeviltry of some of the youths back from service in france from 1919 to 1920 however there was a veritable epidemic of moundvisiting among the prematurely hardened young veteransan epidemic that waxed as one youth after another returned unhurt and contemptuous by 1920so short is human memorythe mound was almost a joke and the tame story of the murdered squaw began to displace darker whispers on everybodys tongues then two reckless young brothersthe especially unimaginative and hardboiled clay boysdecided to go and dig up the buried squaw and the gold for which the old indian had murdered herthey went out on a september afternoonabout the time the indian tomtoms begin their incessant annual beating over the flat reddusty plains nobody watched them and their parents did not become worried at their nonreturn for several hours then came an alarm and a searchingparty and another resignation to the mystery of silence and doubtbut one of them came back after all it was ed the elder and his strawcoloured hair and beard had turned an albino white for two inches from the roots on his forehead was a queer scar like a branded hieroglyph three months after he and his brother walker had vanished he skulked into his house at night wearing nothing but a queerly patterned blanket which he thrust into the fire as soon as he had got into a suit of his own clothes he told his parents that he and walker had been captured by some strange indiansnot wichitas or caddosand held prisoners somewhere toward the west walker had died under torture but he himself had managed to escape at a high cost the experience had been particularly terrible and he could not talk about it just then he must restand anyway it would do no good to give an alarm and try to find and punish the indians they were not of a sort that could be caught or punished and it was especially important for the good of bingerfor the good of the worldthat they be not pursued into their secret lair as a matter of fact they were not altogether what one could call real indianshe would explain about that later meanwhile he must rest better not to rouse the village with the news of his returnhe would go upstairs and sleep before he climbed the rickety flight to his room he took a pad and pencil from the livingroom table and an automatic pistol from his fathers desk drawerthree hours later the shot rang out ed clay had put a bullet neatly through his temples with a pistol clutched in his left hand leaving a sparsely written sheet of paper on the rickety table near his bed he had it later appeared from the whittled pencilstub and stove full of charred paper originally written much more but had finally decided not to tell what he knew beyond vague hints the surviving fragment was only a mad warning scrawled in a curiously backhanded scriptthe ravings of a mind obviously deranged by hardshipsand it read thus rather surprisingly for the utterance of one who had always been stolid and matteroffactfor gods sake never go nere that mound it is part of some kind of a world so devilish and old it cannot be spoke about me and walker went and was took into the thing just melted at times and made up agen and the whole world outside is helpless alongside of what they can dothey what live forever young as they like and you cant tell if they are really men or just gostesand what they do cant be spoke about and this is only 1 entranceyou cant tell how big the whole thing isafter what we seen i dont want to live aney more france was nothing besides thisand see that people always keep away o god they wood if they see poor walker like he was in the endyrs truelyed clayat the autopsy it was found that all of young clays organs were transposed from right to left within his body as if he had been turned inside out whether they had always been so no one could say at the time but it was later learned from army records that ed had been perfectly normal when mustered out of the service in may 1919 whether there was a mistake somewhere or whether some unprecedented metamorphosis had indeed occurred is still an unsettled question as is also the origin of the hieroglyphlike scar on the foreheadthat was the end of the explorations of the mound in the eight intervening years no one had been near the place and few indeed had even cared to level a spy glass at it from time to time people continued to glance nervously at the lone hill as it rose starkly from the plain against the western sky and to shudder at the small dark speck that paraded by day and the glimmering willothewisp that danced by night the thing was accepted at face value as a mystery not to be probed and by common consent the village shunned the subject it was after all quite easy to avoid the hill for space was unlimited in every direction and community life always follows beaten trails the mound side of the village was simply kept trailless as if it had been water or swampland or desert and it is a curious commentary on the stolidity and imaginative sterility of the human animal that the whispers with which children and strangers were warned away from the mound quickly sank once more into the flat tale of a murderous indian ghost and his squaw victim only the tribesmen on the reservation and thoughtful oldtimers like grandma compton remembered the overtones of unholy vistas and deep cosmic menace which clustered around the ravings of those who had come back changed and shatteredit was very late and grandma compton had long since gone upstairs to bed when clyde finished telling me this i hardly knew what to think of the frightful puzzle yet rebelled at any notion to conflict with sane materialism what influence had brought madness or the impulse of flight and wandering to so many who had visited the mound though vastly impressed i was spurred on rather than deterred surely i must get to the bottom of this matter as well i might if i kept a cool head and an unbroken determination compton saw my mood and shook his head worriedly then he motioned me to follow him outdoorswe stepped from the frame house to the quiet side street or lane and walked a few paces in the light of a waning august moon to where the houses were thinner the halfmoon was still low and had not blotted many stars from the sky so that i could see not only the westering gleams of altair and vega but the mystic shimmering of the milky way as i looked out over the vast expanse of earth and sky in the direction that compton pointed then all at once i saw a spark that was not a stara bluish spark that moved and glimmered against the milky way near the horizon and that seemed in a vague way more evil and malevolent than anything in the vault above in another moment it was clear that this spark came from the top of a long distant rise in the outspread and faintly litten plain and i turned to compton with a questionyes he answered its the blue ghostlightand that is the mound theres not a night in history that we havent seen itand not a living soul in binger that would walk out over that plain toward it its a bad business young man and if youre wise youll let it rest where it is better call your search off son and tackle some of the other injun legends around here weve plenty to keep you busy heaven knowsiibut i was in no mood for advice and though compton gave me a pleasant room i could not sleep a wink through eagerness for the next morning with its chances to see the daytime ghost and to question the indians at the reservation i meant to go about the whole thing slowly and thoroughly equipping myself with all available data both white and red before i commenced any actual archaeological investigations i rose and dressed at dawn and when i heard others stirring i went downstairs compton was building the kitchen fire while his mother was busy in the pantry when he saw me he nodded and after a moment invited me out into the glamorous young sunlight i knew where we were going and as we walked along the lane i strained my eyes westward over the plainsthere was the moundfar away and very curious in its aspect of artificial regularity it must have been from thirty to forty feet high and all of a hundred yards from north to south as i looked at it it was not as wide as that from east to west compton said but had the contour of a rather thinnish ellipse he i knew had been safely out to it and back several times as i looked at the rim silhouetted against the deep blue of the west i tried to follow its minor irregularities and became impressed with a sense of something moving upon it my pulse mounted a bit feverishly and i seized quickly on the highpowered binoculars which compton had quietly offered me focussing them hastily i saw at first only a tangle of underbrush on the distant mounds rimand then something stalked into the fieldit was unmistakably a human shape and i knew at once that i was seeing the daytime indian ghost i did not wonder at the description for surely the tall lean darkly robed being with the filleted black hair and seamed coppery expressionless aquiline face looked more like an indian than anything else in my previous experience and yet my trained ethnologists eye told me at once that this was no redskin of any sort hitherto known to history but a creature of vast racial variation and of a wholly different culturestream modern indians are brachycephalicroundheadedand you cant find any dolichocephalic or longheaded skulls except in ancient pueblo deposits dating back 2500 years or more yet this mans longheadedness was so pronounced that i recognised it at once even at his vast distance and in the uncertain field of the binoculars i saw too that the pattern of his robe represented a decorative tradition utterly remote from anything we recognise in southwestern native art there were shining metal trappings likewise and a short sword or kindred weapon at his side all wrought in a fashion wholly alien to anything i had ever heard ofas he paced back and forth along the top of the mound i followed him for several minutes with the glass noting the kinaesthetic quality of his stride and the poised way he carried his head and there was borne in upon me the strong persistent conviction that this man whoever or whatever he might be was certainlynot a savagehe was the product of acivilisationi felt instinctively though of what civilisation i could not guess at length he disappeared beyond the farther edge of the mound as if descending the opposite and unseen slope and i lowered the glass with a curious mixture of puzzled feelings compton was looking quizzically at me and i nodded noncommittally what do you make of that he ventured this is what weve seen here in binger every day of our livesthat noon found me at the indian reservation talking with old grey eaglewho through some miracle was still alive though he must have been close to a hundred and fifty years old he was a strange impressive figurethis stern fearless leader of his kind who had talked with outlaws and traders in fringed buckskin and french officials in kneebreeches and threecornered hatsand i was glad to see that because of my air of deference toward him he appeared to like me his liking however took an unfortunately obstructive form as soon as he learned what i wanted for all he would do was to warn me against the search i was about to makeyou good boyyou no bother that hill bad medicine plenty devil under therecatchum when you dig no dig no hurt go and dig no come back just same when me boy just same when my father and he father boy all time buck he walk in day squaw with no head she walk in night all time since white man with tin coats they come from sunset and below big riverlong way backthree four times more back than grey eagletwo times more back than frenchmenall same after then more back than that nobody go near little hills nor deep valleys with stone caves still more back those old ones no hide come out and make villages bring plenty gold me them you them then big waters come all change nobody come out let nobody in get in no get out they no dieno get old like grey eagle with valleys in face and snow on head just same like airsome man some spirit bad medicine sometimes at night spirit come out on halfmanhalfhorsewithhorn and fight where men once fight keep way them place no good you good boygo way and let them old ones lonethat was all i could get out of the ancient chief and the rest of the indians would say nothing at all but if i was troubled grey eagle was clearly more so for he obviously felt a real regret at the thought of my invading the region he feared so abjectly as i turned to leave the reservation he stopped me for a final ceremonial farewell and once more tried to get my promise to abandon my search when he saw that he could not he produced something halftimidly from a buckskin pouch he wore and extended it toward me very solemnly it was a worn but finely minted metal disc about two inches in diameter oddly figured and perforated and suspended from a leathern cordyou no promise then grey eagle no can tell what get you but if anything help um this good medicine come from my fatherhe get from he fatherhe get from he fatherall way back close to tirwa all mens father my father say you keep way from those old ones keep way from little hills and valleys with stone caves but if old ones they come out to get you then you shew um this medicine they know they make him long way back they look then they no do such bad medicine maybe but no can tell you keep way just same them no good no tell what they doas he spoke grey eagle was hanging the thing around my neck and i saw it was a very curious object indeed the more i looked at it the more i marvelled for not only was its heavy darkish lustrous and richly mottled substance an absolutely strange metal to me but what was left of its design seemed to be of a marvellously artistic and utterly unknown workmanship one side so far as i could see had borne an exquisitely modelled serpent design whilst the other side had depicted a kind of octopus or other tentacled monster there were some halfeffaced hieroglyphs too of a kind which no archaeologist could identify or even place conjecturally with grey eagles permission i later had expert historians anthropologists geologists and chemists pass carefully upon the disc but from them i obtained only a chorus of bafflement it defied either classification or analysis the chemists called it an amalgam of unknown metallic elements of heavy atomic weight and one geologist suggested that the substance must be of meteoric origin shot from unknown gulfs of interstellar space whether it really saved my life or sanity or existence as a human being i cannot attempt to say but grey eagle is sure of it he has it again now and i wonder if it has any connexion with his inordinate age all his fathers who had it lived far beyond the century mark perishing only in battle is it possible that grey eagle if kept from accidents will never die but i am ahead of my storywhen i returned to the village i tried to secure more moundlore but found only excited gossip and opposition it was really flattering to see how solicitous the people were about my safety but i had to set their almost frantic remonstrances aside i shewed them grey eagles charm but none of them had ever heard of it before or seen anything even remotely like it they agreed that it could not be an indian relic and imagined that the old chiefs ancestors must have obtained it from some traderwhen they saw they could not deter me from my trip the binger citizens sadly did what they could to aid my outfitting having known before my arrival the sort of work to be done i had most of my supplies already with memachete and trenchknife for shrubclearing and excavating electric torches for any underground phase which might develop rope fieldglasses tapemeasure microscope and incidentals for emergenciesas much in fact as might be comfortably stowed in a convenient handbag to this equipment i added only the heavy revolver which the sheriff forced upon me and the pick and shovel which i thought might expedite my worki decided to carry these latter things slung over my shoulder with a stout cordfor i soon saw that i could not hope for any helpers or fellowexplorers the village would watch me no doubt with all its available telescopes and fieldglasses but it would not send any citizen so much as a yard over the flat plain toward the lone hillock my start was timed for early the next morning and all the rest of that day i was treated with the awed and uneasy respect which people give to a man about to set out for certain doomwhen morning camea cloudy though not a threatening morningthe whole village turned out to see me start across the dustblown plain binoculars shewed the lone man at his usual pacing on the mound and i resolved to keep him in sight as steadily as possible during my approach at the last moment a vague sense of dread oppressed me and i was just weak and whimsical enough to let grey eagles talisman swing on my chest in full view of any beings or ghosts who might be inclined to heed it bidding au revoir to compton and his mother i started off at a brisk stride despite the bag in my left hand and the clanking pick and shovel strapped to my back holding my fieldglass in my right hand and taking a glance at the silent pacer from time to time as i neared the mound i saw the man very clearly and fancied i could trace an expression of infinite evil and decadence on his seamed hairless features i was startled too to see that his goldenly gleaming weaponcase bore hieroglyphs very similar to those on the unknown talisman i wore all the creatures costume and trappings bespoke exquisite workmanship and cultivation then all too abruptly i saw him start down the farther side of the mound and out of sight when i reached the place about ten minutes after i set out there was no one therethere is no need of relating how i spent the early part of my search in surveying and circumnavigating the mound taking measurements and stepping back to view the thing from different angles it had impressed me tremendously as i approached it and there seemed to be a kind of latent menace in its too regular outlines it was the only elevation of any sort on the wide level plain and i could not doubt for a moment that it was an artificial tumulus the steep sides seemed wholly unbroken and without marks of human tenancy or passage there were no signs of a path toward the top and burdened as i was i managed to scramble up only with considerable difficulty when i reached the summit i found a roughly level elliptical plateau about 300 by 50 feet in dimensions uniformly covered with rank grass and dense underbrush and utterly incompatible with the constant presence of a pacing sentinel this condition gave me a real shock for it shewed beyond question that the old indian vivid though he seemed could not be other than a collective hallucinationi looked about with considerable perplexity and alarm glancing wistfully back at the village and the mass of black dots which i knew was the watching crowd training my glass upon them i saw that they were studying me avidly with their glasses so to reassure them i waved my cap in the air with a show of jauntiness which i was far from feeling then settling to my work i flung down pick shovel and bag taking my machete from the latter and commencing to clear away underbrush it was a weary task and now and then i felt a curious shiver as some perverse gust of wind arose to hamper my motion with a skill approaching deliberateness at times it seemed as if a halftangible force were pushing me back as i workedalmost as if the air thickened in front of me or as if formless hands tugged at my wrists my energy seemed used up without producing adequate results yet for all that i made some progressby afternoon i had clearly perceived that toward the northern end of the mound there was a slight bowllike depression in the roottangled earth while this might mean nothing it would be a good place to begin when i reached the digging stage and i made a mental note of it at the same time i noticed another and very peculiar thingnamely that the indian talisman swinging from my neck seemed to behave oddly at a point about seventeen feet southeast of the suggested bowl its gyrations were altered whenever i happened to stoop around that point and it tugged downward as if attracted by some magnetism in the soil the more i noticed this the more it struck me till at length i decided to do a little preliminary digging there without further delayas i turned up the soil with my trenchknife i could not help wondering at the relative thinness of the reddish regional layer the country as a whole was all red sandstone earth but here i found a strange black loam less than a foot down it was such soil as one finds in the strange deep valleys farther west and south and must surely have been brought from a considerable distance in the prehistoric age when the mound was reared kneeling and digging i felt the leathern cord around my neck tugged harder and harder as something in the soil seemed to draw the heavy metal talisman more and more then i felt my implements strike a hard surface and wondered if a rock layer rested beneath prying about with the trenchknife i found that such was not the case instead to my intense surprise and feverish interest i brought up a mouldclogged heavy object of cylindrical shapeabout a foot long and four inches in diameterto which my hanging talisman clove with gluelike tenacity as i cleared off the black loam my wonder and tension increased at the basreliefs revealed by that process the whole cylinder ends and all was covered with figures and hieroglyphs and i saw with growing excitement that these things were in the same unknown tradition as those on grey eagles charm and on the yellow metal trappings of the ghost i had seen through my binocularssitting down i further cleaned the magnetic cylinder against the rough corduroy of my knickerbockers and observed that it was made of the same heavy lustrous unknown metal as the charmhence no doubt the singular attraction the carvings and chasings were very strange and very horriblenameless monsters and designs fraught with insidious eviland all were of the highest finish and craftsmanship i could not at first make head or tail of the thing and handled it aimlessly until i spied a cleavage near one end then i sought eagerly for some mode of opening discovering at last that the end simply unscrewedthe cap yielded with difficulty but at last it came off liberating a curious aromatic odour the sole contents was a bulky roll of a yellowish paperlike substance inscribed in greenish characters and for a second i had the supreme thrill of fancying that i held a written key to unknown elder worlds and abysses beyond time almost immediately however the unrolling of one end shewed that the manuscript was in spanishalbeit the formal pompous spanish of a longdeparted day in the golden sunset light i looked at the heading and the opening paragraph trying to decipher the wretched and illpunctuated script of the vanished writer what manner of relic was this upon what sort of a discovery had i stumbled the first words set me in a new fury of excitement and curiosity for instead of diverting me from my original quest they startlingly confirmed me in that very effortthe yellow scroll with the green script began with a bold identifying caption and a ceremoniously desperate appeal for belief in incredible revelations to followrelacin de pnfilo de zamacona y nuez hidalgo de luarca en asturias tocante al mundo soterrneo de xinain a d mdxlven el nombre de la

doa yns alvarado y nuez de luarca en asturias juro para que todo que deco est verdadero como sacramento i paused to reflect on the portentous significance of what i was reading the narrative of pnfilo de zamacona y nuez gentleman of luarca in asturiasconcerning the subterranean world of xinaina d 1545 here surely was too much for any mind to absorb all at once a subterranean worldagain that persistent idea which filtered through all the indian tales and through all the utterances of those who had come back from the mound and the date1545what could this mean in 1540 coronado and his men had gone north from mexico into the wilderness but had they not turned back in 1542 my eye ran questingly down the opened part of the scroll and almost at once seized on the namefrancisco vsquez de coronadothe writer of this thing clearly was one of coronados menbut what had he been doing in this remote realm three years after his party had gone back i must read further for another glance told me that what was now unrolled was merely a summary of coronados northward march differing in no essential way from the account known to historyit was only the waning light which checked me before i could unroll and read more and in my impatient bafflement i almost forgot to be frightened at the onrush of night in this sinister place others however had not forgotten the lurking terror for i heard a loud distant hallooing from a knot of men who had gathered at the edge of the town answering the anxious hail i restored the manuscript to its strange cylinderto which the disc around my neck still clung until i pried it off and packed it and my smaller implements for departure leaving the pick and shovel for the next days work i took up my handbag scrambled down the steep side of the mound and in another quarterhour was back in the village explaining and exhibiting my curious find as darkness drew on i glanced back at the mound i had so lately left and saw with a shudder that the faint bluish torch of the nocturnal squawghost had begun to glimmerit was hard work waiting to get at the bygone spaniards narrative but i knew i must have quiet and leisure for a good translation so reluctantly saved the task for the later hours of night promising the townsfolk a clear account of my findings in the morning and giving them an ample opportunity to examine the bizarre and provocative cylinder i accompanied clyde compton home and ascended to my room for the translating process as soon as i possibly could my host and his mother were intensely eager to hear the tale but i thought they had better wait till i could thoroughly absorb the text myself and give them the gist concisely and unerringlyopening my handbag in the light of a single electric bulb i again took out the cylinder and noted the instant magnetism which pulled the indian talisman to its carven surface the designs glimmered evilly on the richly lustrous and unknown metal and i could not help shivering as i studied the abnormal and blasphemous forms that leered at me with such exquisite workmanship i wish now that i had carefully photographed all these designsthough perhaps it is just as well that i did not of one thing i am really glad and that is that i could not then identify the squatting octopusheaded thing which dominated most of the ornate cartouches and which the manuscript called tulu recently i have associated it and the legends in the manuscript connected with it with some newfound folklore of monstrous and unmentioned cthulhu a horror which seeped down from the stars while the young earth was still halfformed and had i known of the connexion then i could not have stayed in the same room with the thing the secondary motif a semianthropomorphic serpent i did quite readily place as a prototype of the yig quetzalcoatl and kukulcan conceptions before opening the cylinder i tested its magnetic powers on metals other than that of grey eagles disc but found that no attraction existed it was no common magnetism which pervaded this morbid fragment of unknown worlds and linked it to its kindat last i took out the manuscript and began translatingjotting down a synoptic outline in english as i went and now and then regretting the absence of a spanish dictionary when i came upon some especially obscure or archaic word or construction there was a sense of ineffable strangeness in thus being thrown back nearly four centuries in the midst of my continuous questthrown back to a year when my own forbears were settled homekeeping gentlemen of somerset and devon under henry the eighth with never a thought of the adventure that was to take their blood to virginia and the new world yet when that new world possessed even as now the same brooding mystery of the mound which formed my present sphere and horizon the sense of a throwback was all the stronger because i felt instinctively that the common problem of the spaniard and myself was one of such abysmal timelessnessof such unholy and unearthly eternitythat the scant four hundred years between us bulked as nothing in comparison it took no more than a single look at that monstrous and insidious cylinder to make me realise the dizzying gulfs that yawned between all men of the known earth and the primal mysteries it represented before that gulf pnfilo de zamacona and i stood side by side just as aristotle and i or cheops and i might have stoodiiiof his youth in luarca a small placid port on the bay of biscay zamacona told little he had been wild and a younger son and had come to new spain in 1532 when only twenty years old sensitively imaginative he had listened spellbound to the floating rumours of rich cities and unknown worlds to the northand especially to the tale of the franciscan friar marcos de niza who came back from a trip in 1539 with glowing accounts of fabulous cbola and its great walled towns with terraced stone houses hearing of coronados contemplated expedition in search of these wondersand of the greater wonders whispered to lie beyond them in the land of buffaloesyoung zamacona managed to join the picked party of 300 and started north with the rest in 1540history knows the story of that expeditionhow cbola was found to be merely the squalid pueblo village of zui and how de niza was sent back to mexico in disgrace for his florid exaggerations how coronado first saw the grand canyon and how at cicuy on the pecos he heard from the indian called el turco of the rich and mysterious land of quivira far to the northeast where gold silver and buffaloes abounded and where there flowed a river two leagues wide zamacona told briefly of the winter camp at tiguex on the pecos and of the northward start in april when the native guide proved false and led the party astray amidst a land of prairiedogs salt pools and roving bisonhunting tribeswhen coronado dismissed his larger force and made his final fortytwoday march with a very small and select detachment zamacona managed to be included in the advancing party he spoke of the fertile country and of the great ravines with trees visible only from the edge of their steep banks and of how all the men lived solely on buffalomeat and then came mention of the expeditions farthest limitof the presumable but disappointing land of quivira with its villages of grass houses its brooks and rivers its good black soil its plums nuts grapes and mulberries and its maizegrowing and copperusing indians the execution of el turco the false native guide was casually touched upon and there was a mention of the cross which coronado raised on the bank of a great river in the autumn of 1541a cross bearing the inscription thus far came the great general francisco vsquez de coronadothis supposed quivira lay at about the fortieth parallel of north latitude and i see that quite lately the new york archaeologist dr hodge has identified it with the course of the arkansas river through barton and rice counties kansas it is the old home of the wichitas before the sioux drove them south into what is now oklahoma and some of the grasshouse village sites have been found and excavated for artifacts coronado did considerable exploring hereabouts led hither and thither by the persistent rumours of rich cities and hidden worlds which floated fearfully around on the indians tongues these northerly natives seemed more afraid and reluctant to talk about the rumoured cities and worlds than the mexican indians had been yet at the same time seemed as if they could reveal a good deal more than the mexicans had they been willing or dared to do so their vagueness exasperated the spanish leader and after many disappointing searches he began to be very severe toward those who brought him stories zamacona more patient than coronado found the tales especially interesting and learned enough of the local speech to hold long conversations with a young buck named charging buffalo whose curiosity had led him into much stranger places than any of his fellowtribesmen had dared to penetrateit was charging buffalo who told zamacona of the queer stone doorways gates or cavemouths at the bottom of some of those deep steep wooded ravines which the party had noticed on the northward march these openings he said were mostly concealed by shrubbery and few had entered them for untold aeons those who went to where they led never returnedor in a few cases returned mad or curiously maimed but all this was legend for nobody was known to have gone more than a limited distance inside any of them within the memory of the grandfathers of the oldest living men charging buffalo himself had probably been farther than anyone else and he had seen enough to curb both his curiosity and his greed for the rumoured gold belowbeyond the aperture he had entered there was a long passage running crazily up and down and round about and covered with frightful carvings of monsters and horrors that no man had ever seen at last after untold miles of windings and descents there was a glow of terrible blue light and the passage opened upon a shocking nether world about this the indian would say no more for he had seen something that had sent him back in haste but the golden cities must be somewhere down there he added and perhaps a white man with the magic of the thunderstick might succeed in getting to them he would not tell the big chief coronado what he knew for coronado would not listen to indian talk any more yeshe could shew zamacona the way if the white man would leave the party and accept his guidance but he would not go inside the opening with the white man it was bad in therethe place was about a five days march to the south near the region of great mounds these mounds had something to do with the evil world down therethey were probably ancient closedup passages to it for once the old ones below had had colonies on the surface and had traded with men everywhere even in the lands that had sunk under the big waters it was when those lands had sunk that the old ones closed themselves up below and refused to deal with surface people the refugees from the sinking places had told them that the gods of outer earth were against men and that no men could survive on the outer earth unless they were daemons in league with the evil gods that is why they shut out all surface folk and did fearful things to any who ventured down where they dwelt there had been sentries once at the various openings but after ages they were no longer needed not many people cared to talk about the hidden old ones and the legends about them would probably have died out but for certain ghostly reminders of their presence now and then it seemed that the infinite ancientness of these creatures had brought them strangely near to the borderline of spirit so that their ghostly emanations were more commonly frequent and vivid accordingly the region of the great mounds was often convulsed with spectral nocturnal battles reflecting those which had been fought in the days before the openings were closedthe old ones themselves were halfghostindeed it was said that they no longer grew old or reproduced their kind but flickered eternally in a state between flesh and spirit the change was not complete though for they had to breathe it was because the underground world needed air that the openings in the deep valleys were not blocked up as the moundopenings on the plains had been these openings charging buffalo added were probably based on natural fissures in the earth it was whispered that the old ones had come down from the stars to the world when it was very young and had gone inside to build their cities of solid gold because the surface was not then fit to live on they were the ancestors of all men yet none could guess from what staror what place beyond the starsthey came their hidden cities were still full of gold and silver but men had better let them alone unless protected by very strong magicthey had frightful beasts with a faint strain of human blood on which they rode and which they employed for other purposes the things so people hinted were carnivorous and like their masters preferred human flesh so that although the old ones themselves did not breed they had a sort of halfhuman slaveclass which also served to nourish the human and animal population this had been very oddly recruited and was supplemented by a second slaveclass of reanimated corpses the old ones knew how to make a corpse into an automaton which would last almost indefinitely and perform any sort of work when directed by streams of thought charging buffalo said that the people had all come to talk by means of thought only speech having been found crude and needless except for religious devotions and emotional expression as aeons of discovery and study rolled by they worshipped yig the great father of serpents and tulu the octopusheaded entity that had brought them down from the stars appeasing both of these hideous monstrosities by means of human sacrifices offered up in a very curious manner which charging buffalo did not care to describezamacona was held spellbound by the indians tale and at once resolved to accept his guidance to the cryptic doorway in the ravine he did not believe the accounts of strange ways attributed by legend to the hidden people for the experiences of the party had been such as to disillusion one regarding native myths of unknown lands but he did feel that some sufficiently marvellous field of riches and adventure must indeed lie beyond the weirdly carved passages in the earth at first he thought of persuading charging buffalo to tell his story to coronadooffering to shield him against any effects of the leaders testy scepticismbut later he decided that a lone adventure would be better if he had no aid he would not have to share anything he found but might perhaps become a great discoverer and owner of fabulous riches success would make him a greater figure than coronado himselfperhaps a greater figure than anyone else in new spain including even the mighty viceroy don antonio de mendozaon october 7 1541 at an hour close to midnight zamacona stole out of the spanish camp near the grasshouse village and met charging buffalo for the long southward journey he travelled as lightly as possible and did not wear his heavy helmet and breastplate of the details of the trip the manuscript told very little but zamacona records his arrival at the great ravine on october 13th the descent of the thickly wooded slope took no great time and though the indian had trouble in locating the shrubberyhidden stone door again amidst the twilight of that deep gorge the place was finally found it was a very small aperture as doorways go formed of monolithic sandstone jambs and lintel and bearing signs of nearly effaced and now undecipherable carvings its height was perhaps seven feet and its width not more than four there were drilled places in the jambs which argued the bygone presence of a hinged door or gate but all other traces of such a thing had long since vanishedat sight of this black gulf charging buffalo displayed considerable fear and threw down his pack of supplies with signs of haste he had provided zamacona with a good stock of resinous torches and provisions and had guided him honestly and well but refused to share in the venture that lay ahead zamacona gave him the trinkets he had kept for such an occasion and obtained his promise to return to the region in a month afterward shewing the way southward to the pecos pueblo villages a prominent rock on the plain above them was chosen as a meetingplace the one arriving first to pitch camp until the other should arrivein the manuscript zamacona expressed a wistful wonder as to the indians length of waiting at the rendezvousfor he himself could never keep that tryst at the last moment charging buffalo tried to dissuade him from his plunge into the darkness but soon saw it was futile and gestured a stoical farewell before lighting his first torch and entering the opening with his ponderous pack the spaniard watched the lean form of the indian scrambling hastily and rather relievedly upward among the trees it was the cutting of his last link with the world though he did not know that he was never to see a human beingin the accepted sense of that termagainzamacona felt no immediate premonition of evil upon entering that ominous doorway though from the first he was surrounded by a bizarre and unwholesome atmosphere the passage slightly taller and wider than the aperture was for many yards a level tunnel of cyclopean masonry with heavily worn flagstones under foot and grotesquely carved granite and sandstone blocks in sides and ceiling the carvings must have been loathsome and terrible indeed to judge from zamaconas description according to which most of them revolved around the monstrous beings yig and tulu they were unlike anything the adventurer had ever seen before though he added that the native architecture of mexico came closest to them of all things in the outer world after some distance the tunnel began to dip abruptly and irregular natural rock appeared on all sides the passage seemed only partly artificial and decorations were limited to occasional cartouches with shocking basreliefsfollowing an enormous descent whose steepness at times produced an acute danger of slipping and tobogganing the passage became exceedingly uncertain in its direction and variable in its contour at times it narrowed almost to a slit or grew so low that stooping and even crawling were necessary while at other times it broadened out into sizeable caves or chains of caves very little human construction it was plain had gone into this part of the tunnel though occasionally a sinister cartouche or hieroglyphic on the wall or a blockedup lateral passageway would remind zamacona that this was in truth the aeonforgotten highroad to a primal and unbelievable world of living thingsfor three days as best he could reckon pnfilo de zamacona scrambled down up along and around but always predominately downward through this dark region of palaeogean night once in a while he heard some secret being of darkness patter or flap out of his way and on just one occasion he half glimpsed a great bleached thing that set him trembling the quality of the air was mostly very tolerable though foetid zones were now and then met with while one great cavern of stalactites and stalagmites afforded a depressing dampness this latter when charging buffalo had come upon it had quite seriously barred the way since the limestone deposits of ages had built fresh pillars in the path of the primordial abyssdenizens the indian however had broken through these so that zamacona did not find his course impeded it was an unconscious comfort to him to reflect that someone else from the outside world had been there beforeand the indians careful descriptions had removed the element of surprise and unexpectedness morecharging buffalos knowledge of the tunnel had led him to provide so good a torch supply for the journey in and out that there would be no danger of becoming stranded in darkness zamacona camped twice building a fire whose smoke seemed well taken care of by the natural ventilationat what he considered the end of the third daythough his cocksure guesswork chronology is not at any time to be given the easy faith that he gave itzamacona encountered the prodigious descent and subsequent prodigious climb which charging buffalo had described as the tunnels last phase as at certain earlier points marks of artificial improvement were here discernible and several times the steep gradient was eased by a flight of roughhewn steps the torch shewed more and more of the monstrous carvings on the walls and finally the resinous flare seemed mixed with a fainter and more diffusive light as zamacona climbed up and up after the last downward stairway at length the ascent ceased and a level passage of artificial masonry with dark basaltic blocks led straight ahead there was no need for a torch now for all the air was glowing with a bluish quasielectric radiance that flickered like an aurora it was the strange light of the inner world that the indian had describedand in another moment zamacona emerged from the tunnel upon a bleak rocky hillside which climbed above him to a seething impenetrable sky of bluish coruscations and descended dizzily below him to an apparently illimitable plain shrouded in bluish misthe had come to the unknown world at last and from his manuscript it is clear that he viewed the formless landscape as proudly and exaltedly as ever his fellowcountryman balboa viewed the newfound pacific from that unforgettable peak in darien charging buffalo had turned back at this point driven by fear of something which he would only describe vaguely and evasively as a herd of bad cattle neither horse nor buffalo but like the things the moundspirits rode at nightbut zamacona could not be deterred by any such trifle instead of fear a strange sense of glory filled him for he had imagination enough to know what it meant to stand alone in an inexplicable nether world whose existence no other white man suspectedthe soil of the great hill that surged upward behind him and spread steeply downward below him was dark grey rockstrown without vegetation and probably basaltic in origin with an unearthly cast which made him feel like an intruder on an alien planet the vast distant plain thousands of feet below had no features he could distinguish especially since it appeared to be largely veiled in a curling bluish vapour but more than hill or plain or cloud the bluely luminous coruscating sky impressed the adventurer with a sense of supreme wonder and mystery what created this sky within a world he could not tell though he knew of the northern lights and had even seen them once or twice he concluded that this subterraneous light was something vaguely akin to the aurora a view which moderns may well endorse though it seems likely that certain phenomena of radioactivity may also enter inat zamaconas back the mouth of the tunnel he had traversed yawned darkly defined by a stone doorway very like the one he had entered in the world above save that it was of greyishblack basalt instead of red sandstone there were hideous sculptures still in good preservation and perhaps corresponding to those on the outer portal which time had largely weathered away the absence of weathering here argued a dry temperate climate indeed the spaniard already began to note the delightfully springlike stability of temperature which marks the air of the norths interior on the stone jambs were works proclaiming the bygone presence of hinges but of any actual door or gate no trace remained seating himself for rest and thought zamacona lightened his pack by removing an amount of food and torches sufficient to take him back through the tunnel these he proceeded to cache at the opening under a cairn hastily formed of the rock fragments which everywhere lay around then readjusting his lightened pack he commenced his descent toward the distant plain preparing to invade a region which no living thing of outer earth had penetrated in a century or more which no white man had ever penetrated and from which if legend were to be believed no organic creature had ever returned sanezamacona strode briskly along down the steep interminable slope his progress checked at times by the bad walking that came from loose rock fragments or by the excessive precipitousness of the grade the distance of the mistshrouded plain must have been enormous for many hours walking brought him apparently no closer to it than he had been before behind him was always the great hill stretching upward into a bright arial sea of bluish coruscations silence was universal so that his own footsteps and the fall of stones that he dislodged struck on his ears with startling distinctness it was at what he regarded as about noon that he first saw the abnormal footprints which set him to thinking of charging buffalos terrible hints precipitate flight and strangely abiding terrorthe rockstrown nature of the soil gave few opportunities for tracks of any kind but at one point a rather level interval had caused the loose detritus to accumulate in a ridge leaving a considerable area of darkgrey loam absolutely bare here in a rambling confusion indicating a large herd aimlessly wandering zamacona found the abnormal prints it is to be regretted that he could not describe them more exactly but the manuscript displayed far more vague fear than accurate observation just what it was that so frightened the spaniard can only be inferred from his later hints regarding the beasts he referred to the prints as not hooves nor hands nor feet nor precisely pawsnor so large as to cause alarm on that account just why or how long ago the things had been there was not easy to guess there was no vegetation visible hence grazing was out of the question but of course if the beasts were carnivorous they might well have been hunting smaller animals whose tracks their own would tend to obliterateglancing backward from this plateau to the heights above zamacona thought he detected traces of a great winding road which had once led from the tunnel downward to the plain one could get the impression of this former highway only from a broad panoramic view since a trickle of loose rock fragments had long ago obscured it but the adventurer felt none the less certain that it had existed it had not probably been an elaborately paved trunk route for the small tunnel it reached seemed scarcely like a main avenue to the outer world in choosing a straight path of descent zamacona had not followed its curving course though he must have crossed it once or twice with his attention now called to it he looked ahead to see if he could trace it downward toward the plain and this he finally thought he could do he resolved to investigate its surface when next he crossed it and perhaps to pursue its line for the rest of the way if he could distinguish ithaving resumed his journey zamacona came some time later upon what he thought was a bend of the ancient road there were signs of grading and of some primal attempt at rocksurfacing but not enough was left to make the route worth following while rummaging about in the soil with his sword the spaniard turned up something that glittered in the eternal blue daylight and was thrilled at beholding a kind of coin or medal of a dark unknown lustrous metal with hideous designs on each side it was utterly and bafflingly alien to him and from his description i have no doubt but that it was a duplicate of the talisman given me by grey eagle almost four centuries afterward pocketing it after a long and curious examination he strode onward finally pitching camp at an hour which he guessed to be the evening of the outer worldthe next day zamacona rose early and resumed his descent through this bluelitten world of mist and desolation and preternatural silence as he advanced he at last became able to distinguish a few objects on the distant plain belowtrees bushes rocks and a small river that came into view from the right and curved forward at a point to the left of his contemplated course this river seemed to be spanned by a bridge connected with the descending roadway and with care the explorer could trace the route of the road beyond it in a straight line over the plain finally he even thought he could detect towns scattered along the rectilinear ribbon towns whose lefthand edges reached the river and sometimes crossed it where such crossings occurred he saw as he descended there were always signs of bridges either ruined or surviving he was now in the midst of a sparse grassy vegetation and saw that below him the growth became thicker and thicker the road was easier to define now since its surface discouraged the grass which the looser soil supported rock fragments were less frequent and the barren upward vista behind him looked bleak and forbidding in contrast to his present milieuit was on this day that he saw the blurred mass moving over the distant plain since his first sight of the sinister footprints he had met with no more of these but something about that slowly and deliberately moving mass peculiarly sickened him nothing but a herd of grazing animals could move just like that and after seeing the footprints he did not wish to meet the things which had made them still the moving mass was not near the roadand his curiosity and greed for fabled gold were great besides who could really judge things from vague jumbled footprints or from the panictwisted hints of an ignorant indianin straining his eyes to view the moving mass zamacona became aware of several other interesting things one was that certain parts of the now unmistakable towns glittered oddly in the misty blue light another was that besides the towns several similarly glittering structures of a more isolated sort were scattered here and there along the road and over the plain they seemed to be embowered in clumps of vegetation and those off the road had small avenues leading to the highway no smoke or other signs of life could be discerned about any of the towns or buildings finally zamacona saw that the plain was not infinite in extent though the halfconcealing blue mists had hitherto made it seem so it was bounded in the remote distance by a range of low hills toward a gap in which the river and roadway seemed to lead all thisespecially the glittering of certain pinnacles in the townshad become very vivid when zamacona pitched his second camp amidst the endless blue day he likewise noticed the flocks of highsoaring birds whose nature he could not clearly make outthe next afternoonto use the language of the outer world as the manuscript did at all timeszamacona reached the silent plain and crossed the soundless slowrunning river on a curiously carved and fairly wellpreserved bridge of black basalt the water was clear and contained large fishes of a wholly strange aspect the roadway was now paved and somewhat overgrown with weeds and creeping vines and its course was occasionally outlined by small pillars bearing obscure symbols on every side the grassy level extended with here and there a clump of trees or shrubbery and with unidentifiable bluish flowers growing irregularly over the whole area now and then some spasmodic motion of the grass indicated the presence of serpents in the course of several hours the traveller reached a grove of old and alienlooking evergreentrees which he knew from distant viewing protected one of the glitteringroofed isolated structures amidst the encroaching vegetation he saw the hideously sculptured pylons of a stone gateway leading off the road and was presently forcing his way through briers above a mosscrusted tessellated walk lined with huge trees and low monolithic pillarsat last in this hushed green twilight he saw the crumbling and ineffably ancient facade of the buildinga temple he had no doubt it was a mass of nauseous basreliefs depicting scenes and beings objects and ceremonies which could certainly have no place on this or any sane planet in hinting of these things zamacona displays for the first time that shocked and pious hesitancy which impairs the informative value of the rest of his manuscript we cannot help regretting that the catholic ardour of renaissance spain had so thoroughly permeated his thought and feeling the door of the place stood wide open and absolute darkness filled the windowless interior conquering the repulsion which the mural sculptures had excited zamacona took out flint and steel lighted a resinous torch pushed aside curtaining vines and sallied boldly across the ominous thresholdfor a moment he was quite stupefied by what he saw it was not the allcovering dust and cobwebs of immemorial aeons the fluttering winged things the shriekingly loathsome sculptures on the walls the bizarre form of the many basins and braziers the sinister pyramidal altar with the hollow top or the monstrous octopusheaded abnormality in some strange dark metal leering and squatting broodingly on its hieroglyphed pedestal which robbed him of even the power to give a startled cry it was nothing so unearthly as thisbut merely the fact that with the exception of the dust the cobwebs the winged things and the gigantic emeraldeyed idol every particle of substance in sight was composed of pure and evidently solid goldeven the manuscript written in retrospect after zamacona knew that gold is the most common structural metal of a nether world containing limitless lodes and veins of it reflects the frenzied excitement which the traveller felt upon suddenly finding the real source of all the indian legends of golden cities for a time the power of detailed observation left him but in the end his faculties were recalled by a peculiar tugging sensation in the pocket of his doublet tracing the feeling he realised that the disc of strange metal he had found in the abandoned road was being attracted strongly by the vast octopusheaded emeraldeyed idol on the pedestal which he now saw to be composed of the same unknown exotic metal he was later to learn that this strange magnetic substanceas alien to the inner world as to the outer world of menis the one precious metal of the bluelighted abyss none knows what it is or where it occurs in nature and the amount of it on this planet came down from the stars with the people when great tulu the octopusheaded god brought them for the first time to this earth certainly its only known source was a stock of preexisting artifacts including multitudes of cyclopean idols it could never be placed or analysed and even its magnetism was exerted only on its own kind it was the supreme ceremonial metal of the hidden people its use being regulated by custom in such a way that its magnetic properties might cause no inconvenience a very weakly magnetic alloy of it with such base metals as iron gold silver copper or zinc had formed the sole monetary standard of the hidden people at one period of their historyzamaconas reflections on the strange idol and its magnetism were disturbed by a tremendous wave of fear as for the first time in this silent world he heard a rumble of very definite and obviously approaching sound there was no mistaking its nature it was a thunderously charging herd of large animals and remembering the indians panic the footprints and the moving mass distantly seen the spaniard shuddered in terrified anticipation he did not analyse his position or the significance of this onrush of great lumbering beings but merely responded to an elemental urge toward selfprotection charging herds do not stop to find victims in obscure places and on the outer earth zamacona would have felt little or no alarm in such a massive grovegirt edifice some instinct however now bred a deep and peculiar terror in his soul and he looked about frantically for any means of safetythere being no available refuge in the great goldpatined interior he felt that he must close the longdisused door which still hung on its ancient hinges doubled back against the inner wall soil vines and moss had entered the opening from outside so that he had to dig a path for the great gold portal with his sword but he managed to perform this work very swiftly under the frightful stimulus of the approaching noise the hoofbeats had grown still louder and more menacing by the time he began tugging at the heavy door itself and for a while his fears reached a frantic height as hope of starting the ageclogged metal grew faint then with a creak the thing responded to his youthful strength and a frenzied siege of pulling and pushing ensued amidst the roar of unseen stampeding feet success came at last and the ponderous golden door clanged shut leaving zamacona in darkness but for the single lighted torch he had wedged between the pillars of a basintripod there was a latch and the frightened man blessed his patron saint that it was still effectivesound alone told the fugitive the sequel when the roar grew very near it resolved itself into separate footfalls as if the evergreen grove had made it necessary for the herd to slacken speed and disperse but feet continued to approach and it became evident that the beasts were advancing among the trees and circling the hideously carven temple walls in the curious deliberation of their tread zamacona found something very alarming and repulsive nor did he like the scuffling sounds which were audible even through the thick stone walls and heavy golden door once the door rattled ominously on its archaic hinges as if under a heavy impact but fortunately it still held then after a seemingly endless interval he heard retreating steps and realised that his unknown visitors were leaving since the herds did not seem to be very numerous it would have perhaps been safe to venture out within a halfhour or less but zamacona took no chances opening his pack he prepared his camp on the golden tiles of the temples floor with the great door still securely latched against all comers drifting eventually into a sounder sleep than he could have known in the bluelitten spaces outside he did not even mind the hellish octopusheaded bulk of great tulu fashioned of unknown metal and leering with fishy seagreen eyes which squatted in the blackness above him on its monstrously hieroglyphed pedestalsurrounded by darkness for the first time since leaving the tunnel zamacona slept profoundly and long he must have more than made up the sleep he had lost at his two previous camps when the ceaseless glare of the sky had kept him awake despite his fatigue for much distance was covered by other living feet while he lay in his healthily dreamless rest it is well that he rested deeply for there were many strange things to be encountered in his next period of consciousnessivwhat finally roused zamacona was a thunderous rapping at the door it beat through his dreams and dissolved all the lingering mists of drowsiness as soon as he knew what it was there could be no mistake about itit was a definite human and peremptory rapping performed apparently with some metallic object and with all the measured quality of conscious thought or will behind it as the awakening man rose clumsily to his feet a sharp vocal note was added to the summonssomeone calling out in a not unmusical voice a formula which the manuscript tries to represent as oxi oxi giathcn yc relex feeling sure that his visitors were men and not daemons and arguing that they could have no reason for considering him an enemy zamacona decided to face them openly and at once and accordingly fumbled with the ancient latch till the golden door creaked open from the pressure of those outsideas the great portal swung back zamacona stood facing a group of about twenty individuals of an aspect not calculated to give him alarm they seemed to be indians though their tasteful robes and trappings and swords were not such as he had seen among any of the tribes of the outer world while their faces had many subtle differences from the indian type that they did not mean to be irresponsibly hostile was very clear for instead of menacing him in any way they merely probed him attentively and significantly with their eyes as if they expected their gaze to open up some sort of communication the longer they gazed the more he seemed to know about them and their mission for although no one had spoken since the vocal summons before the opening of the door he found himself slowly realising that they had come from the great city beyond the low hills mounted on animals and that they had been summoned by animals who had reported his presence that they were not sure what kind of person he was or just where he had come from but that they knew he must be associated with that dimly remembered outer world which they sometimes visited in curious dreams how he read all this in the gaze of the two or three leaders he could not possibly explain though he learned why a moment lateras it was he attempted to address his visitors in the wichita dialect he had picked up from charging buffalo and after this failed to draw a vocal reply he successively tried the aztec spanish french and latin tonguesadding as many scraps of lame greek galician and portuguese and of the bable peasant patois of his native asturias as his memory could recall but not even this polyglot arrayhis entire linguistic stockcould bring a reply in kind when however he paused in perplexity one of the visitors began speaking in an utterly strange and rather fascinating language whose sounds the spaniard later had much difficulty in representing on paper upon his failure to understand this the speaker pointed first to his own eyes then to his forehead and then to his eyes again as if commanding the other to gaze at him in order to absorb what he wanted to transmitzamacona obeying found himself rapidly in possession of certain information the people he learned conversed nowadays by means of unvocal radiations of thought although they had formerly used a spoken language which still survived as the written tongue and into which they still dropped orally for traditions sake or when strong feeling demanded a spontaneous outlet he could understand them merely by concentrating his attention upon their eyes and could reply by summoning up a mental image of what he wished to say and throwing the substance of this into his glance when the thoughtspeaker paused apparently inviting a response zamacona tried his best to follow the prescribed pattern but did not appear to succeed very well so he nodded and tried to describe himself and his journey by signs he pointed upward as if to the outer world then closed his eyes and made signs as of a mole burrowing then he opened his eyes again and pointed downward in order to indicate his descent of the great slope experimentally he blended a spoken word or two with his gesturesfor example pointing successively to himself and to all of his visitors and saying un hombre and then pointing to himself alone and very carefully pronouncing his individual namepnfilo de zamaconabefore the strange conversation was over a good deal of data had passed in both directions zamacona had begun to learn how to throw his thoughts and had likewise picked up several words of the regions archaic spoken language his visitors moreover had absorbed many beginnings of an elementary spanish vocabulary their own old language was utterly unlike anything the spaniard had ever heard though there were times later on when he was to fancy an infinitely remote linkage with the aztec as if the latter represented some far stage of corruption or some very thin infiltration of loanwords the underground world zamacona learned bore an ancient name which the manuscript records as xinain but which from the writers supplementary explanations and diacritical marks could probably be best represented to anglosaxon ears by the phonetic arrangementknyanit is not surprising that this preliminary discourse did not go beyond the merest essentials but those essentials were highly important zamacona learned that the people of knyan were almost infinitely ancient and that they had come from a distant part of space where physical conditions are much like those of the earth all this of course was legend now and one could not say how much truth was in it or how much worship was really due to the octopusheaded being tulu who had traditionally brought them hither and whom they still reverenced for aesthetic reasons but they knew of the outer world and were indeed the original stock who had peopled it as soon as its crust was fit to live on between glacial ages they had had some remarkable surface civilisations especially one at the south pole near the mountain kadathat some time infinitely in the past most of the outer world had sunk beneath the ocean so that only a few refugees remained to bear the news to knyan this was undoubtedly due to the wrath of spacedevils hostile alike to men and to mens godsfor it bore out rumours of a primordially earlier sinking which had submerged the gods themselves including great tulu who still lay prisoned and dreaming in the watery vaults of the halfcosmic city relex no man not a slave of the spacedevils it was argued could live long on the outer earth and it was decided that all beings who remained there must be evilly connected accordingly traffic with the lands of sun and starlight abruptly ceased the subterraneous approaches to knyan or such as could be remembered were either blocked up or carefully guarded and all encroachers were treated as dangerous spies and enemiesbut this was long ago with the passing of ages fewer and fewer visitors came to knyan and eventually sentries ceased to be maintained at the unblocked approaches the mass of the people forgot except through distorted memories and myths and some very singular dreams that an outer world existed though educated folk never ceased to recall the essential facts the last visitors ever recordedcenturies in the pasthad not even been treated as devilspies faith in the old legendry having long before died out they had been questioned eagerly about the fabulous outer regions for scientific curiosity in knyan was keen and the myths memories dreams and historical fragments relating to the earths surface had often tempted scholars to the brink of an external expedition which they had not quite dared to attempt the only thing demanded of such visitors was that they refrain from going back and informing the outer world of knyans positive existence for after all one could not be sure about these outer lands they coveted gold and silver and might prove highly troublesome intruders those who had obeyed the injunction had lived happily though regrettably briefly and had told all they could about their worldlittle enough however since their accounts were all so fragmentary and conflicting that one could hardly tell what to believe and what to doubt one wished that more of them would come as for those who disobeyed and tried to escapeit was very unfortunate about them zamacona himself was very welcome for he appeared to be a highergrade man and to know much more about the outer world than anyone else who had come down within memory he could tell them muchand they hoped he would be reconciled to his lifelong staymany things which zamacona learned about knyan in that first colloquy left him quite breathless he learned for instance that during the past few thousand years the phenomena of old age and death had been conquered so that men no longer grew feeble or died except through violence or will by regulating the system one might be as physiologically young and immortal as he wished and the only reason why any allowed themselves to age was that they enjoyed the sensation in a world where stagnation and commonplaceness reigned they could easily become young again when they felt like it births had ceased except for experimental purposes since a large population had been found needless by a masterrace which controlled nature and organic rivals alike many however chose to die after a while since despite the cleverest efforts to invent new pleasures the ordeal of consciousness became too dull for sensitive soulsespecially those in whom time and satiation had blinded the primal instincts and emotions of selfpreservation all the members of the group before zamacona were from 500 to 1500 years old and several had seen surface visitors before though time had blurred the recollection these visitors by the way had often tried to duplicate the longevity of the underground race but had been able to do so only fractionally owing to evolutionary differences developing during the million or two years of cleavagethese evolutionary differences were even more strikingly shewn in another particularone far stranger than the wonder of immortality itself this was the ability of the people of knyan to regulate the balance between matter and abstract energy even where the bodies of living organic beings were concerned by the sheer force of the technically trained will in other words with suitable effort a learned man of knyan could dematerialise and rematerialise himselfor with somewhat greater effort and subtler technique any other object he chose reducing solid matter to free external particles and recombining the particles again without damage had not zamacona answered his visitors knock when he did he would have discovered this accomplishment in a highly puzzling way for only the strain and bother of the process prevented the twenty men from passing bodily through the golden door without pausing for a summons this art was much older than the art of perpetual life and it could be taught to some extent though never perfectly to any intelligent person rumours of it had reached the outer world in past aeons surviving in secret traditions and ghostly legendry the men of knyan had been amused by the primitive and imperfect spirit tales brought down by outerworld stragglers in practical life this principle had certain industrial applications but was generally suffered to remain neglected through lack of any particular incentive to its use its chief surviving form was in connexion with sleep when for excitements sake many dreamconnoisseurs resorted to it to enhance the vividness of their visionary wanderings by the aid of this method certain dreamers even paid halfmaterial visits to a strange nebulous realm of mounds and valleys and varying light which some believed to be the forgotten outer world they would go thither on their beasts and in an age of peace live over the old glorious battles of their forefathers some philosophers thought that in such cases they actually coalesced with immaterial forces left behind by these warlike ancestors themselvesthe people of knyan all dwelt in the great tall city of tsath beyond the mountains formerly several races of them had inhabited the entire underground world which stretched down to unfathomable abysses and which included besides the bluelitten region a redlitten region called yoth where relics of a still older and nonhuman race were found by archaeologists in the course of time however the men of tsath had conquered and enslaved the rest interbreeding them with certain horned and fourfooted animals of the redlitten region whose semihuman leanings were very peculiar and which though containing a certain artificially created element may have been in part the degenerate descendants of those peculiar entities who had left the relics as aeons passed and mechanical discoveries made the business of life extremely easy a concentration of the people of tsath took place so that all the rest of knyan became relatively desertedit was easier to live in one place and there was no object in maintaining a population of overflowing proportions many of the old mechanical devices were still in use though others had been abandoned when it was seen that they failed to give pleasure or that they were not necessary for a race of reduced numbers whose mental force could govern an extensive array of inferior and semihuman industrial organisms this extensive slaveclass was highly composite being bred from ancient conquered enemies from outerworld stragglers from dead bodies curiously galvanised into effectiveness and from the naturally inferior members of the ruling race of tsath the ruling type itself had become highly superior through selective breeding and social evolutionthe nation having passed through a period of idealistic industrial democracy which gave equal opportunities to all and thus by raising the naturally intelligent to power drained the masses of all their brains and stamina industry being found fundamentally futile except for the supplying of basic needs and the gratification of inescapable yearnings had become very simple physical comfort was ensured by an urban mechanisation of standardised and easily maintained pattern and other elemental needs were supplied by scientific agriculture and stockraising long travel was abandoned and people went back to using the horned halfhuman beasts instead of maintaining the profusion of gold silver and steel transportation machines which had once threaded land water and air zamacona could scarcely believe that such things had ever existed outside dreams but was told he could see specimens of them in museums he could also see the ruins of other vast magical devices by travelling a days journey to the valley of dohna to which the race had spread during its period of greatest numbers the cities and temples of this present plain were of a far more archaic period and had never been other than religious and antiquarian shrines during the supremacy of the men of tsathin government tsath was a kind of communistic or semianarchical state habit rather than law determining the daily order of things this was made possible by the ageold experience and paralysing ennui of the race whose wants and needs were limited to physical fundamentals and to new sensations an aeonlong tolerance not yet undermined by growing reaction had abolished all illusions of values and principles and nothing but an approximation to custom was ever sought or expected to see that the mutual encroachments of pleasureseeking never crippled the mass life of the communitythis was all that was desired family organisation had long ago perished and the civil and social distinction of the sexes had disappeared daily life was organised in ceremonial patterns with games intoxication torture of slaves daydreaming gastronomic and emotional orgies religious exercises exotic experiments artistic and philosophical discussions and the like as the principal occupations propertychiefly land slaves animals shares in the common city enterprise of tsath and ingots of magnetic tulumetal the former universal money standardwas allocated on a very complex basis which included a certain amount equally divided among all the freemen poverty was unknown and labour consisted only of certain administrative duties imposed by an intricate system of testing and selection zamacona found difficulty in describing conditions so unlike anything he had previously known and the text of his manuscript proved unusually puzzling at this pointart and intellect it appeared had reached very high levels in tsath but had become listless and decadent the dominance of machinery had at one time broken up the growth of normal aesthetics introducing a lifelessly geometrical tradition fatal to sound expression this had soon been outgrown but had left its mark upon all pictorial and decorative attempts so that except for conventionalised religious designs there was little depth or feeling in any later work archaistic reproductions of earlier work had been found much preferable for general enjoyment literature was all highly individual and analytical so much so as to be wholly incomprehensible to zamacona science had been profound and accurate and allembracing save in the one direction of astronomy of late however it was falling into decay as people found it increasingly useless to tax their minds by recalling its maddening infinitude of details and ramifications it was thought more sensible to abandon the deepest speculations and to confine philosophy to conventional forms technology of course could be carried on by rule of thumb history was more and more neglected but exact and copious chronicles of the past existed in the libraries it was still an interesting subject and there would be a vast number to rejoice at the fresh outerworld knowledge brought in by zamacona in general though the modern tendency was to feel rather than to think so that men were now more highly esteemed for inventing new diversions than for preserving old facts or pushing back the frontier of cosmic mysteryreligion was a leading interest in tsath though very few actually believed in the supernatural what was desired was the aesthetic and emotional exaltation bred by the mystical moods and sensuous rites which attended the colourful ancestral faith temples to great tulu a spirit of universal harmony anciently symbolised as the octopusheaded god who had brought all men down from the stars were the most richly constructed objects in all knyan while the cryptic shrines of yig the principle of life symbolised as the father of all serpents were almost as lavish and remarkable in time zamacona learned much of the orgies and sacrifices connected with this religion but seemed piously reluctant to describe them in his manuscript he himself never participated in any of the rites save those which he mistook for perversions of his own faith nor did he ever lose an opportunity to try to convert the people to that faith of the cross which the spaniards hoped to make universalprominent in the contemporary religion of tsath was a revived and almost genuine veneration for the rare sacred metal of tuluthat dark lustrous magnetic stuff which was nowhere found in nature but which had always been with men in the form of idols and hieratic implements from the earliest times any sight of it in its unalloyed form had impelled respect while all the sacred archives and litanies were kept in cylinders wrought of its purest substance now as the neglect of science and intellect was dulling the critically analytical spirit people were beginning to weave around the metal once more that same fabric of awestruck superstition which had existed in primitive timesanother function of religion was the regulation of the calendar born of a period when time and speed were regarded as prime fetiches in mans emotional life periods of alternate waking and sleeping prolonged abridged and inverted as mood and convenience dictated and timed by the tailbeats of great yig the serpent corresponded very roughly to terrestrial days and nights though zamaconas sensations told him they must actually be almost twice as long the yearunit measured by yigs annual shedding of his skin was equal to about a year and a half of the outer world zamacona thought he had mastered this calendar very well when he wrote his manuscript whence the confidently given date of 1545 but the document failed to suggest that his assurance in this matter was fully justifiedas the spokesman of the tsath party proceeded with his information zamacona felt a growing repulsion and alarm it was not only what was told but the strange telepathic manner of telling and the plain inference that return to the outer world would be impossible that made the spaniard wish he had never descended to this region of magic abnormality and decadence but he knew that nothing but friendly acquiescence would do as a policy hence decided to coperate in all his visitors plans and furnish all the information they might desire they on their part were fascinated by the outerworld data which he managed haltingly to conveyit was really the first draught of reliable surface information they had had since the refugees straggled back from atlantis and lemuria aeons before for all their subsequent emissaries from outside had been members of narrow and local groups without any knowledge of the world at largemayas toltecs and aztecs at best and mostly ignorant tribes of the plains zamacona was the first european they had ever seen and the fact that he was a youth of education and brilliancy made him of still more emphatic value as a source of knowledge the visiting party shewed their breathless interest in all he contrived to convey and it was plain that his coming would do much to relieve the flagging interest of weary tsath in matters of geography and historythe only thing which seemed to displease the men of tsath was the fact that curious and adventurous strangers were beginning to pour into those parts of the upper world where the passages to knyan lay zamacona told them of the founding of florida and new spain and made it clear that a great part of the world was stirring with the zest of adventurespanish portuguese french and english sooner or later mexico and florida must meet in one great colonial empireand then it would be hard to keep outsiders from the rumoured gold and silver of the abyss charging buffalo knew of zamaconas journey into the earth would he tell coronado or somehow let a report get to the great viceroy when he failed to find the traveller at the promised meetingplace alarm for the continued secrecy and safety of knyan shewed in the faces of the visitors and zamacona absorbed from their minds the fact that from now on sentries would undoubtedly be posted once more at all the unblocked passages to the outside world which the men of tsath could remembervthe long conversation of zamacona and his visitors took place in the greenblue twilight of the grove just outside the temple door some of the men reclined on the weeds and moss beside the halfvanished walk while others including the spaniard and the chief spokesman of the tsath party sat on the occasional low monolithic pillars that lined the temple approach almost a whole terrestrial day must have been consumed in the colloquy for zamacona felt the need of food several times and ate from his wellstocked pack while some of the tsath party went back for provisions to the roadway where they had left the animals on which they had ridden at length the prime leader of the party brought the discourse to a close and indicated that the time had come to proceed to the citythere were he affirmed several extra beasts in the cavalcade upon one of which zamacona could ride the prospect of mounting one of those ominous hybrid entities whose fabled nourishment was so alarming and a single sight of which had set charging buffalo into such a frenzy of flight was by no means reassuring to the traveller there was moreover another point about the things which disturbed him greatlythe apparently preternatural intelligence with which some members of the previous days roving pack had reported his presence to the men of tsath and brought out the present expedition but zamacona was not a coward hence followed the men boldly down the weedgrown walk toward the road where the things were stationedand yet he could not refrain from crying out in terror at what he saw when he passed through the great vinedraped pylons and emerged upon the ancient road he did not wonder that the curious wichita had fled in panic and had to close his eyes a moment to retain his sanity it is unfortunate that some sense of pious reticence prevented him from describing fully in his manuscript the nameless sight he saw as it is he merely hinted at the shocking morbidity of these great floundering white things with black fur on their backs a rudimentary horn in the centre of their foreheads and an unmistakable trace of human or anthropoid blood in their flatnosed bulginglipped faces they were he declared later in his manuscript the most terrible objective entities he ever saw in his life either in knyan or in the outer world and the specific quality of their supreme terror was something apart from any easily recognisable or describable feature the main trouble was that they were not wholly products of naturethe party observed zamaconas fright and hastened to reassure him as much as possible the beasts orgyaayothnthey explained surely were curious things but were really very harmless the flesh they ate was not that of intelligent people of the masterrace but merely that of a special slaveclass which had for the most part ceased to be thoroughly human and which indeed was the principal meat stock of knyan theyor their principal ancestral elementhad first been found in a wild state amidst the cyclopean ruins of the deserted redlitten world of yoth which lay below the bluelitten world of knyan that part of them was human seemed quite clear but men of science could never decide whether they were actually the descendants of the bygone entities who had lived and reigned in the strange ruins the chief ground for such a supposition was the wellknown fact that the vanished inhabitants of yoth had been quadrupedal this much was known from the very few manuscripts and carvings found in the vaults of zin beneath the largest ruined city of yoth but it was also known from these manuscripts that the beings of yoth had possessed the art of synthetically creating life and had made and destroyed several efficiently designed races of industrial and transportational animals in the course of their historyto say nothing of concocting all manner of fantastic living shapes for the sake of amusement and new sensations during the long period of decadence the beings of yoth had undoubtedly been reptilian in affiliations and most physiologists of tsath agreed that the present beasts had been very much inclined toward reptilianism before they had been crossed with the mammal slaveclass of knyanit argues well for the intrepid fire of those renaissance spaniards who conquered half the unknown world that pnfilo de zamacona y nuez actually mounted one of the morbid beasts of tsath and fell into place beside the leader of the cavalcadethe man named gllhthaaynn who had been most active in the previous exchange of information it was a repulsive business but after all the seat was very easy and the gait of the clumsygyaayothsurprisingly even and regular no saddle was necessary and the animal appeared to require no guidance whatever the procession moved forward at a brisk gait stopping only at certain abandoned cities and temples about which zamacona was curious and which gllhthaaynn was obligingly ready to display and explain the largest of these towns bgraa was a marvel of finely wrought gold and zamacona studied the curiously ornate architecture with avid interest buildings tended toward height and slenderness with roofs bursting into a multitude of pinnacles the streets were narrow curving and occasionally picturesquely hilly but gllhthaaynn said that the later cities of knyan were far more spacious and regular in design all these old cities of the plain shewed traces of levelled wallsreminders of the archaic days when they had been successively conquered by the now dispersed armies of tsaththere was one object along the route which gllhthaaynn exhibited on his own initiative even though it involved a detour of about a mile along a vinetangled side path this was a squat plain temple of black basalt blocks without a single carving and containing only a vacant onyx pedestal the remarkable thing about it was its story for it was a link with a fabled elder world compared to which even cryptic yoth was a thing of yesterday it had been built in imitation of certain temples depicted in the vaults of zin to house a very terrible black toadidol found in the redlitten world and called tsathoggua in the yothic manuscripts it had been a potent and widely worshipped god and after its adoption by the people of knyan had lent its name to the city which was later to become dominant in that region yothic legend said that it had come from a mysterious inner realm beneath the redlitten worlda black realm of peculiarsensed beings which had no light at all but which had had great civilisations and mighty gods before ever the reptilian quadrupeds of yoth had come into being many images of tsathoggua existed in yoth all of which were alleged to have come from the black inner realm and which were supposed by yothic archaeologists to represent the aeonextinct race of that realm the black realm called nkai in the yothic manuscripts had been explored as thoroughly as possible by these archaeologists and singular stone troughs or burrows had excited infinite speculationwhen the men of knyan discovered the redlitten world and deciphered its strange manuscripts they took over the tsathoggua cult and brought all the frightful toad images up to the land of blue lighthousing them in shrines of yothquarried basalt like the one zamacona now saw the cult flourished until it almost rivalled the ancient cults of yig and tulu and one branch of the race even took it to the outer world where the smallest of the images eventually found a shrine at olatho in the land of lomar near the earths north pole it was rumoured that this outerworld cult survived even after the great icesheet and the hairy gnophkehs destroyed lomar but of such matters not much was definitely known in knyan in that world of blue light the cult came to an abrupt end even though the name of tsath was suffered to remainwhat ended the cult was the partial exploration of the black realm of nkai beneath the redlitten world of yoth according to the yothic manuscripts there was no surviving life in nkai but something must have happened in the aeons between the days of yoth and the coming of men to the earth something perhaps not unconnected with the end of yoth probably it had been an earthquake opening up lower chambers of the lightless world which had been closed against the yothic archaeologists or perhaps some more frightful juxtaposition of energy and electrons wholly inconceivable to any sort of vertebrate minds had taken place at any rate when the men of knyan went down into nkais black abyss with their great atompower searchlights they found living thingsliving things that oozed along stone channels and worshipped onyx and basalt images of tsathoggua but they were not toads like tsathoggua himself far worsethey were amorphous lumps of viscous black slime that took temporary shapes for various purposes the explorers of knyan did not pause for detailed observations and those who escaped alive sealed the passage leading from redlitten yoth down into the gulfs of nether horror then all the images of tsathoggua in the land of knyan were dissolved into the ether by disintegrating rays and the cult was abolished foreveraeons later when naive fears were outgrown and supplanted by scientific curiosity the old legends of tsathoggua and nkai were recalled and a suitably armed and equipped exploring party went down to yoth to find the closed gate of the black abyss and see what might still lie beneath but they could not find the gate nor could any man ever do so in all the ages that followed nowadays there were those who doubted that any abyss had ever existed but the few scholars who could still decipher the yothic manuscripts believed that the evidence for such a thing was adequate even though the middle records of knyan with accounts of the one frightful expedition into nkai were more open to question some of the later religious cults tried to suppress remembrance of nkais existence and attached severe penalties to its mention but these had not begun to be taken seriously at the time of zamaconas advent to knyanas the cavalcade returned to the old highway and approached the low range of mountains zamacona saw that the river was very close on the left somewhat later as the terrain rose the stream entered a gorge and passed through the hills while the road traversed the gap at a rather higher level close to the brink it was about this time that light rainfall came zamacona noticed the occasional drops and drizzle and looked up at the coruscating blue air but there was no diminution of the strange radiance gllhthaaynn then told him that such condensations and precipitations of watervapour were not uncommon and that they never dimmed the glare of the vault above a kind of mist indeed always hung about the lowlands of knyan and compensated for the complete absence of true cloudsthe slight rise of the mountain pass enabled zamacona by looking behind to see the ancient and deserted plain in panorama as he had seen it from the other side he seems to have appreciated its strange beauty and to have vaguely regretted leaving it for he speaks of being urged by gllhthaaynn to drive his beast more rapidly when he faced frontward again he saw that the crest of the road was very near the weedgrown way leading starkly up and ending against a blank void of blue light the scene was undoubtedly highly impressivea steep green mountain wall on the right a deep riverchasm on the left with another green mountain wall beyond it and ahead the churning sea of bluish coruscations into which the upward path dissolved then came the crest itself and with it the world of tsath outspread in a stupendous forward vistazamacona caught his breath at the great sweep of peopled landscape for it was a hive of settlement and activity beyond anything he had ever seen or dreamed of the downward slope of the hill itself was relatively thinly strown with small farms and occasional temples but beyond it lay an enormous plain covered like a chess board with planted trees irrigated by narrow canals cut from the river and threaded by wide geometrically precise roads of gold or basalt blocks great silver cables borne aloft on golden pillars linked the low spreading buildings and clusters of buildings which rose here and there and in some places one could see lines of partly ruinous pillars without cables moving objects shewed the fields to be under tillage and in some cases zamacona saw that men were ploughing with the aid of the repulsive halfhuman quadrupedsbut most impressive of all was the bewildering vision of clustered spires and pinnacles which rose afar off across the plain and shimmered flowerlike and spectral in the coruscating blue light at first zamacona thought it was a mountain covered with houses and temples like some of the picturesque hill cities of his own spain but a second glance shewed him that it was not indeed such it was a city of the plain but fashioned of such heavenreaching towers that its outline was truly that of a mountain above it hung a curious greyish haze through which the blue light glistened and took added overtones of radiance from the million golden minarets glancing at gllhthaaynn zamacona knew that this was the monstrous gigantic and omnipotent city of tsathas the road turned downward toward the plain zamacona felt a kind of uneasiness and sense of evil he did not like the beast he rode or the world that could provide such a beast and he did not like the atmosphere that brooded over the distant city of tsath when the cavalcade began to pass occasional farms the spaniard noticed the forms that worked in the fields and did not like their motions and proportions or the mutilations he saw on most of them moreover he did not like the way that some of these forms were herded in corrals or the way they grazed on the heavy verdure gllhthaaynn indicated that these beings were members of the slaveclass and that their acts were controlled by the master of the farm who gave them hypnotic impressions in the morning of all they were to do during the day as semiconscious machines their industrial efficiency was nearly perfect those in the corrals were inferior specimens classified merely as livestockupon reaching the plain zamacona saw the larger farms and noted the almost human work performed by the repulsive horned gyaayothn he likewise observed the more manlike shapes that toiled along the furrows and felt a curious fright and disgust toward certain of them whose motions were more mechanical than those of the rest these gllhthaaynn explained were what men called theymbhiorganisms which had died but which had been mechanically reanimated for industrial purposes by means of atomic energy and thoughtpower the slaveclass did not share the immortality of the freemen of tsath so that with time the number of ymbhi had become very large they were doglike and faithful but not so readily amenable to thoughtcommands as were living slaves those which most repelled zamacona were those whose mutilations were greatest for some were wholly headless while others had suffered singular and seemingly capricious subtractions distortions transpositions and graftings in various places the spaniard could not account for this condition but gllhthaaynn made it clear that these were slaves who had been used for the amusement of the people in some of the vast arenas for the men of tsath were connoisseurs of delicate sensation and required a constant supply of fresh and novel stimuli for their jaded impulses zamacona though by no means squeamish was not favourably impressed by what he saw and heardapproached more closely the vast metropolis became dimly horrible in its monstrous extent and inhuman height gllhthaaynn explained that the upper parts of the great towers were no longer used and that many had been taken down to avoid the bother of maintenance the plain around the original urban area was covered with newer and smaller dwellings which in many cases were preferred to the ancient towers from the whole mass of gold and stone a monotonous roar of activity droned outward over the plain while cavalcades and streams of wagons were constantly entering and leaving over the great gold or stonepaved roadsseveral times gllhthaaynn paused to shew zamacona some particular object of interest especially the temples of yig tulu nug yeb and the nottobenamed one which lined the road at infrequent intervals each in its embowering grove according to the custom of knyan these temples unlike those of the deserted plain beyond the mountains were still in active use large parties of mounted worshippers coming and going in constant streams gllhthaaynn took zamacona into each of them and the spaniard watched the subtle orgiastic rites with fascination and repulsion the ceremonies of nug and yeb sickened him especiallyso much indeed that he refrained from describing them in his manuscript one squat black temple of tsathoggua was encountered but it had been turned into a shrine of shubniggurath the allmother and wife of the nottobenamed one this deity was a kind of sophisticated astarte and her worship struck the pious catholic as supremely obnoxious what he liked least of all were the emotional sounds emitted by the celebrantsjarring sounds in a race that had ceased to use vocal speech for ordinary purposesclose to the compact outskirts of tsath and well within the shadow of its terrifying towers gllhthaaynn pointed out a monstrous circular building before which enormous crowds were lined up this he indicated was one of the many amphitheatres where curious sports and sensations were provided for the weary people of knyan he was about to pause and usher zamacona inside the vast curved facade when the spaniard recalling the mutilated forms he had seen in the fields violently demurred this was the first of those friendly clashes of taste which were to convince the people of tsath that their guest followed strange and narrow standardstsath itself was a network of strange and ancient streets and despite a growing sense of horror and alienage zamacona was enthralled by its intimations of mystery and cosmic wonder the dizzy giganticism of its overawing towers the monstrous surge of teeming life through its ornate avenues the curious carvings on its doorways and windows the odd vistas glimpsed from balustraded plazas and tiers of titan terraces and the enveloping grey haze which seemed to press down on the gorgelike streets in low ceilingfashion all combined to produce such a sense of adventurous expectancy as he had never known before he was taken at once to a council of executives which held forth in a goldandcopper palace behind a gardened and fountained park and was for some time subjected to close friendly questioning in a vaulted hall frescoed with vertiginous arabesques much was expected of him he could see in the way of historical information about the outside earth but in return all the mysteries of knyan would be unveiled to him the one great drawback was the inexorable ruling that he might never return to the world of sun and stars and spain which was hisa daily programme was laid down for the visitor with time apportioned judiciously among several kinds of activities there were to be conversations with persons of learning in various places and lessons in many branches of tsathic lore liberal periods of research were allowed for and all the libraries of knyan both secular and sacred were to be thrown open to him as soon as he might master the written languages rites and spectacles were to be attendedexcept when he might especially objectand much time would be left for the enlightened pleasureseeking and emotional titillation which formed the goal and nucleus of daily life a house in the suburbs or an apartment in the city would be assigned him and he would be initiated into one of the large affectiongroups including many noblewomen of the most extreme and artenhanced beauty which in latterday knyan took the place of family units several horned gyaayothn would be provided for his transportation and errandrunning and ten living slaves of intact body would serve to conduct his establishment and protect him from thieves and sadists and religious orgiasts on the public highways there were many mechanical devices which he must learn to use but gllhthaaynn would instruct him immediately regarding the principal onesupon his choosing an apartment in preference to a suburban villa zamacona was dismissed by the executives with great courtesy and ceremony and was led through several gorgeous streets to a clifflike carven structure of some seventy or eighty floors preparations for his arrival had already been instituted and in a spacious groundfloor suite of vaulted rooms slaves were busy adjusting hangings and furniture there were lacquered and inlaid tabourets velvet and silk recliningcorners and squattingcushions and infinite rows of teakwood and ebony pigeonholes with metal cylinders containing some of the manuscripts he was soon to readstandard classics which all urban apartments possessed desks with great stacks of membranepaper and pots of the prevailing green pigment were in every roomeach with graded sets of pigment brushes and other odd bits of stationery mechanical writing devices stood on ornate golden tripods while over all was shed a brilliant blue light from energyglobes set in the ceiling there were windows but at this shadowy groundlevel they were of scant illuminating value in some of the rooms were elaborate baths while the kitchen was a maze of technical contrivances supplies were brought zamacona was told through the network of underground passages which lay beneath tsath and which had once accommodated curious mechanical transports there was a stable on that underground level for the beasts and zamacona would presently be shewn how to find the nearest runway to the street before his inspection was finished the permanent staff of slaves arrived and were introduced and shortly afterward there came some halfdozen freemen and noblewomen of his future affectiongroup who were to be his companions for several days contributing what they could to his instruction and amusement upon their departure another party would take their place and so onward in rotation through a group of about fifty membersvithus was pnfilo de zamacona y nuez absorbed for four years into the life of the sinister city of tsath in the bluelitten nether world of knyan all that he learned and saw and did is clearly not told in his manuscript for a pious reticence overcame him when he began to write in his native spanish tongue and he dared not set down everything much he consistently viewed with repulsion and many things he steadfastly refrained from seeing or doing or eating for other things he atoned by frequent countings of the beads of his rosary he explored the entire world of knyan including the deserted machinecities of the middle period on the gorsegrown plain of nith and made one descent into the redlitten world of yoth to see the cyclopean ruins he witnessed prodigies of craft and machinery which left him breathless and beheld human metamorphoses dematerialisations rematerialisations and reanimations which made him cross himself again and again his very capacity for astonishment was blunted by the plethora of new marvels which every day brought himbut the longer he stayed the more he wished to leave for the inner life of knyan was based on impulses very plainly outside his radius as he progressed in historical knowledge he understood more but understanding only heightened his distaste he felt that the people of tsath were a lost and dangerous racemore dangerous to themselves than they knewand that their growing frenzy of monotonywarfare and noveltyquest was leading them rapidly toward a precipice of disintegration and utter horror his own visit he could see had accelerated their unrest not only by introducing fears of outside invasion but by exciting in many a wish to sally forth and taste the diverse external world he described as time progressed he noticed an increasing tendency of the people to resort to dematerialisation as an amusement so that the apartments and amphitheatres of tsath became a veritable witches sabbath of transmutations ageadjustments deathexperiments and projections with the growth of boredom and restlessness he saw cruelty and subtlety and revolt were growing apace there was more and more cosmic abnormality more and more curious sadism more and more ignorance and superstition and more and more desire to escape out of physical life into a halfspectral state of electronic dispersalall his efforts to leave however came to nothing persuasion was useless as repeated trials proved though the mature disillusion of the upper classes at first prevented them from resenting their guests open wish for departure in a year which he reckoned as 1543 zamacona made an actual attempt to escape through the tunnel by which he had entered knyan but after a weary journey across the deserted plain he encountered forces in the dark passage which discouraged him from future attempts in that direction as a means of sustaining hope and keeping the image of home in mind he began about this time to make rough draughts of the manuscript relating his adventures delighting in the loved old spanish words and the familiar letters of the roman alphabet somehow he fancied he might get the manuscript to the outer world and to make it convincing to his fellows he resolved to enclose it in one of the tulumetal cylinders used for sacred archives that alien magnetic substance could not but support the incredible story he had to tellbut even as he planned he had little real hope of ever establishing contact with the earths surface every known gate he knew was guarded by persons or forces that it were better not to oppose his attempt at escape had not helped matters for he could now see a growing hostility to the outer world he represented he hoped that no other european would find his way in for it was possible that later comers might not fare as well as he he himself had been a cherished fountain of data and as such had enjoyed a privileged status others deemed less necessary might receive rather different treatment he even wondered what would happen to him when the sages of tsath considered him drained dry of fresh facts and in selfdefence began to be more gradual in his talks on earthlore conveying whenever he could the impression of vast knowledge held in reserveone other thing which endangered zamaconas status in tsath was his persistent curiosity regarding the ultimate abyss of nkai beneath redlitten yoth whose existence the dominant religious cults of knyan were more and more inclined to deny when exploring yoth he had vainly tried to find the blockedup entrance and later on he experimented in the arts of dematerialisation and projection hoping that he might thereby be able to throw his consciousness downward into the gulfs which his physical eyes could not discover though never becoming truly proficient in these processes he did manage to achieve a series of monstrous and portentous dreams which he believed included some elements of actual projection into nkai dreams which greatly shocked and perturbed the leaders of yig and tuluworship when he related them and which he was advised by friends to conceal rather than exploit in time those dreams became very frequent and maddening containing things which he dared not record in his main manuscript but of which he prepared a special record for the benefit of certain learned men in tsathit may have been unfortunateor it may have been mercifully fortunatethat zamacona practiced so many reticences and reserved so many themes and descriptions for subsidiary manuscripts the main document leaves one to guess much about the detailed manners customs thoughts language and history of knyan as well as to form any adequate picture of the visual aspect and daily life of tsath one is left puzzled too about the real motivations of the people their strange passivity and craven unwarlikeness and their almost cringing fear of the outer world despite their possession of atomic and dematerialising powers which would have made them unconquerable had they taken the trouble to organise armies as in the old days it is evident that knyan was far along in its decadencereacting with mixed apathy and hysteria against the standardised and timetabled life of stultifying regularity which machinery had brought it during its middle period even the grotesque and repulsive customs and modes of thought and feeling can be traced to this source for in his historical research zamacona found evidence of bygone eras in which knyan had held ideas much like those of the classic and renaissance outer world and had possessed a national character and art full of what europeans regard as dignity kindness and nobilitythe more zamacona studied these things the more apprehensive about the future he became because he saw that the omnipresent moral and intellectual disintegration was a tremendously deepseated and ominously accelerating movement even during his stay the signs of decay multiplied rationalism degenerated more and more into fanatical and orgiastic superstition centring in a lavish adoration of the magnetic tulumetal and tolerance steadily dissolved into a series of frenzied hatreds especially toward the outer world of which the scholars were learning so much from him at times he almost feared that the people might some day lose their agelong apathy and brokenness and turn like desperate rats against the unknown lands above them sweeping all before them by virtue of their singular and stillremembered scientific powers but for the present they fought their boredom and sense of emptiness in other ways multiplying their hideous emotional outlets and increasing the mad grotesqueness and abnormality of their diversions the arenas of tsath must have been accursed and unthinkable placeszamacona never went near them and what they would be in another century or even in another decade he did not dare to think the pious spaniard crossed himself and counted his beads more often than usual in those daysin the year 1545 as he reckoned it zamacona began what may well be accepted as his final series of attempts to leave knyan his fresh opportunity came from an unexpected sourcea female of his affectiongroup who conceived for him a curious individual infatuation based on some hereditary memory of the days of monogamous wedlock in tsath over this femalea noblewoman of moderate beauty and of at least average intelligence named tlayubzamacona acquired the most extraordinary influence finally inducing her to help him in an escape under the promise that he would let her accompany him chance proved a great factor in the course of events for tlayub came of a primordial family of gatelords who had retained oral traditions of at least one passage to the outer world which the mass of people had forgotten even at the time of the great closing a passage to a mound on the level plains of earth which had in consequence never been sealed up or guarded she explained that the primordial gatelords were not guards or sentries but merely ceremonial and economic proprietors halffeudal and baronial in status of an era preceding the severance of surfacerelations her own family had been so reduced at the time of the closing that their gate had been wholly overlooked and they had ever afterward preserved the secret of its existence as a sort of hereditary secreta source of pride and of a sense of reserve power to offset the feeling of vanished wealth and influence which so constantly irritated themzamacona now working feverishly to get his manuscript into final form in case anything should happen to him decided to take with him on his outward journey only five beastloads of unalloyed gold in the form of the small ingots used for minor decorationsenough he calculated to make him a personage of unlimited power in his own world he had become somewhat hardened to the sight of the monstrousgyaayothnduring his four years of residence in tsath hence did not shrink from using the creatures yet he resolved to kill and bury them and cache the gold as soon as he reached the outer world since he knew that even a glimpse of one of the things would drive any ordinary indian mad later he could arrange for a suitable expedition to transport the treasure to mexico tlayub he would perhaps allow to share his fortunes for she was by no means unattractive though possibly he would arrange for her sojourn amongst the plains indians since he was not overanxious to preserve links with the manner of life in tsath for a wife of course he would choose a lady of spainor at worst an indian princess of normal outerworld descent and a regular and approved past but for the present tlayub must be used as a guide the manuscript he would carry on his own person encased in a bookcylinder of the sacred and magnetic tulumetalthe expedition itself is described in the addendum to zamaconas manuscript written later and in a hand shewing signs of nervous strain it set out amidst the most careful precautions choosing a restperiod and proceeding as far as possible along the faintly lighted passages beneath the city zamacona and tlayub disguised in slaves garments bearing provisionknapsacks and leading the five laden beasts on foot were readily taken for commonplace workers and they clung as long as possible to the subterranean wayusing a long and littlefrequented branch which had formerly conducted the mechanical transports to the now ruined suburb of lthaa amidst the ruins of lthaa they came to the surface thereafter passing as rapidly as possible over the deserted bluelitten plain of nith toward the grhyan range of low hills there amidst the tangled underbrush tlayub found the long disused and halffabulous entrance to the forgotten tunnel a thing she had seen but once beforeaeons in the past when her father had taken her thither to shew her this monument to their family pride it was hard work getting the ladengyaayothnto scrape through the obstructing vines and briers and one of them displayed a rebelliousness destined to bear dire consequencesbolting away from the party and loping back toward tsath on its detestable pads golden burden and allit was nightmare work burrowing by the light of blueray torches upward downward forward and upward again through a dank choked tunnel that no foot had trodden since ages before the sinking of atlantis and at one point tlayub had to practice the fearsome art of dematerialisation on herself zamacona and the laden beasts in order to pass a point wholly clogged by shifting earthstrata it was a terrible experience for zamacona for although he had often witnessed dematerialisation in others and even practiced it himself to the extent of dreamprojection he had never been fully subjected to it before but tlayub was skilled in the arts of knyan and accomplished the double metamorphosis in perfect safetythereafter they resumed the hideous burrowing through stalactited crypts of horror where monstrous carvings leered at every turn alternately camping and advancing for a period which zamacona reckoned as about three days but which was probably less at last they came to a very narrow place where the natural or only slightly hewn cavewalls gave place to walls of wholly artificial masonry carved into terrible basreliefs these walls after about a mile of steep ascent ended with a pair of vast niches one on each side in which monstrous nitreencrusted images of yig and tulu squatted glaring at each other across the passage as they had glared since the earliest youth of the human world at this point the passage opened into a prodigious vaulted and circular chamber of human construction wholly covered with horrible carvings and revealing at the farther end an arched passageway with the foot of a flight of steps tlayub knew from family tales that this must be very near the earths surface but she could not tell just how near here the party camped for what they meant to be their last restperiod in the subterraneous worldit must have been hours later that the clank of metal and the padding of beasts feet awakened zamacona and tlayub a bluish glare was spreading from the narrow passage between the images of yig and tulu and in an instant the truth was obvious an alarm had been given at tsathas was later revealed by the returning gyaayoth which had rebelled at the brierchoked tunnelentranceand a swift party of pursuers had come to arrest the fugitives resistance was clearly useless and none was offered the party of twelve beastriders proved studiously polite and the return commenced almost without a word or thoughtmessage on either sideit was an ominous and depressing journey and the ordeal of dematerialisation and rematerialisation at the choked place was all the more terrible because of the lack of that hope and expectancy which had palliated the process on the outward trip zamacona heard his captors discussing the imminent clearing of this choked place by intensive radiations since henceforward sentries must be maintained at the hitherto unknown outer portal it would not do to let outsiders get within the passage for then any who might escape without due treatment would have a hint of the vastness of the inner world and would perhaps be curious enough to return in greater strength as with the other passages since zamaconas coming sentries must be stationed all along as far as the very outermost gate sentries drawn from amongst all the slaves the deadaliveymbhior the class of discredited freemen with the overrunning of the american plains by thousands of europeans as the spaniard had predicted every passage was a potential source of danger and must be rigorously guarded until the technologists of tsath could spare the energy to prepare an ultimate and entrancehiding obliteration as they had done for many passages in earlier and more vigorous timeszamacona and tlayub were tried before threegnagnof the supreme tribunal in the goldandcopper palace behind the gardened and fountained park and the spaniard was given his liberty because of the vital outerworld information he still had to impart he was told to return to his apartment and to his affectiongroup taking up his life as before and continuing to meet deputations of scholars according to the latest schedule he had been following no restrictions would be imposed upon him so long as he might remain peacefully in knyanbut it was intimated that such leniency would not be repeated after another attempt at escape zamacona had felt that there was an element of irony in the parting words of the chiefgnagan assurance that all ofhis gyaayothnincluding the one which had rebelled would be returned to himthe fate of tlayub was less happy there being no object in retaining her and her ancient tsathic lineage giving her act a greater aspect of treason than zamaconas had possessed she was ordered to be delivered to the curious diversions of the amphitheatre and afterward in a somewhat mutilated and halfdematerialised form to be given the functions of aymbhior animated corpseslave and stationed among the sentries guarding the passage whose existence she had betrayed zamacona soon heard not without many pangs of regret he could scarcely have anticipated that poor tlayub had emerged from the arena in a headless and otherwise incomplete state and had been set as an outermost guard upon the mound in which the passage had been found to terminate she was he was told a nightsentinel whose automatic duty was to warn off all comers with a torch sending down reports to a small garrison of twelve dead slaveymbhiand six living but partly dematerialised freemen in the vaulted circular chamber if the approachers did not heed her warning she worked he was told in conjunction with a daysentinela living freeman who chose this post in preference to other forms of discipline for other offences against the state zamacona of course had long known that most of the chief gatesentries were such discredited freemenit was now made plain to him though indirectly that his own penalty for another escapeattempt would be service as a gatesentrybut in the form of a deadaliveymbhislave and after amphitheatretreatment even more picturesque than that which tlayub was reported to have undergone it was intimated that heor parts of himwould be reanimated to guard some inner section of the passage within sight of others where his abridged person might serve as a permanent symbol of the rewards of treason but his informants always added it was of course inconceivable that he would ever court such a fate so long as he remained peaceably in knyan he would continue to be a free privileged and respected personageyet in the end pnfilo de zamacona did court the fate so direfully hinted to him true he did not really expect to encounter it but the nervous latter part of his manuscript makes it clear that he was prepared to face its possibility what gave him a final hope of scatheless escape from knyan was his growing mastery of the art of dematerialisation having studied it for years and having learned still more from the two instances in which he had been subjected to it he now felt increasingly able to use it independently and effectively the manuscript records several notable experiments in this artminor successes accomplished in his apartmentand reflects zamaconas hope that he might soon be able to assume the spectral form in full attaining complete invisibility and preserving that condition as long as he wishedonce he reached this stage he argued the outward way lay open to him of course he could not bear away any gold but mere escape was enough he would though dematerialise and carry away with him his manuscript in the tulumetal cylinder even though it cost additional effort for this record and proof must reach the outer world at all hazards he now knew the passage to follow and if he could thread it in an atomscattered state he did not see how any person or force could detect or stop him the only trouble would be if he failed to maintain his spectral condition at all times that was the one everpresent peril as he had learned from his experiments but must one not always risk death and worse in a life of adventure zamacona was a gentleman of old spain of the blood that faced the unknown and carved out half the civilisation of the new worldfor many nights after his ultimate resolution zamacona prayed to st pamphilus and other guardian saints and counted the beads of his rosary the last entry in the manuscript which toward the end took the form of a diary more and more was merely a single sentencees ms tarde de lo que pensabatengo que marcharme it is later than i thought i must go after that only silence and conjectureand such evidence as the presence of the manuscript itself and what that manuscript could lead to might provideviiwhen i looked up from my halfstupefied reading and notetaking the morning sun was high in the heavens the electric bulb was still burning but such things of the real worldthe modern outer worldwere far from my whirling brain i knew i was in my room at clyde comptons at bingerbut upon what monstrous vista had i stumbled was this thing a hoax or a chronicle of madness if a hoax was it a jest of the sixteenth century or of today the manuscripts age looked appallingly genuine to my not wholly unpracticed eyes and the problem presented by the strange metal cylinder i dared not even think aboutmoreover what a monstrously exact explanation it gave of all the baffling phenomena of the moundof the seemingly meaningless and paradoxical actions of diurnal and nocturnal ghosts and of the queer cases of madness and disappearance it was even an accursedlyplausibleexplanationevillyconsistentif one could adopt the incredible it must be a shocking hoax devised by someone who knew all the lore of the mound there was even a hint of social satire in the account of that unbelievable nether world of horror and decay surely this was the clever forgery of some learned cynicsomething like the leaden crosses in new mexico which a jester once planted and pretended to discover as a relique of some forgotten dark age colony from europeupon going down to breakfast i hardly knew what to tell compton and his mother as well as the curious callers who had already begun to arrive still in a daze i cut the gordian knot by giving a few points from the notes i had made and mumbling my belief that the thing was a subtle and ingenious fraud left there by some previous explorer of the mounda belief in which everybody seemed to concur when told of the substance of the manuscript it is curious how all that breakfast groupand all the others in binger to whom the discussion was repeatedseemed to find a great clearing of the atmosphere in the notion that somebody was playing a joke on somebody for the time we all forgot that the known recent history of the mound presented mysteries as strange as any in the manuscript and as far from acceptable solution as everthe fears and doubts began to return when i asked for volunteers to visit the mound with me i wanted a larger excavating partybut the idea of going to that uncomfortable place seemed no more attractive to the people of binger than it had seemed on the previous day i myself felt a mounting horror upon looking toward the mound and glimpsing the moving speck which i knew was the daylight sentinel for in spite of all my scepticism the morbidities of that manuscript stuck by me and gave everything connected with the place a new and monstrous significance i absolutely lacked the resolution to look at the moving speck with my binoculars instead i set out with the kind of bravado we display in nightmareswhen knowing we are dreaming we plunge desperately into still thicker horrors for the sake of having the whole thing over the sooner my pick and shovel were already out there so i had only my handbag of smaller paraphernalia to take into this i put the strange cylinder and its contents feeling vaguely that i might possibly find something worth checking up with some part of the greenlettered spanish text even a clever hoax might be founded on some actual attribute of the mound which a former explorer had discoveredand that magnetic metal was damnably odd grey eagles cryptic talisman still hung from its leathern cord around my necki did not look very sharply at the mound as i walked toward it but when i reached it there was nobody in sight repeating my upward scramble of the previous day i was troubled by thoughts of whatmightlie close at handifby any miracle any part of the manuscriptwereactually halftrue in such a case i could not help reflecting the hypothetical spaniard zamacona must have barely reached the outer world when overtaken by some disasterperhaps an involuntary rematerialisation he would naturally in that event have been seized by whichever sentry happened to be on duty at the timeeither the discredited freeman or as a matter of supreme irony the very tlayub who had planned and aided his first attempt at escapeand in the ensuing struggle the cylinder with the manuscript might well have been dropped on the mounds summit to be neglected and gradually buried for nearly four centuries but i added as i climbed over the crest one must not think of extravagant things like that still if therewereanything in the tale it must have been a monstrous fate to which zamacona had been dragged back the amphitheatre mutilation duty somewhere in the dank nitrous tunnel as a deadalive slave a maimed corpsefragment as an automatic interior sentry it was a very real shock which chased this morbid speculation from my head for upon glancing around the elliptical summit i saw at once that my pick and shovel had been stolen this was a highly provoking and disconcerting development baffling too in view of the seeming reluctance of all the binger folk to visit the mound was this reluctance a pretended thing and had the jokers of the village been chuckling over my coming discomfiture as they solemnly saw me off ten minutes before i took out my binoculars and scanned the gaping crowd at the edge of the village nothey did not seem to be looking for any comic climax yet was not the whole affair at bottom a colossal joke in which all the villagers and reservation people were concernedlegends manuscript cylinder and all i thought of how i had seen the sentry from a distance and then found him unaccountably vanished thought also of the conduct of old grey eagle of the speech and expressions of compton and his mother and of the unmistakable fright of most of the binger people on the whole it could not very well be a villagewide joke the fear and the problem were surely real though obviously there were one or two jesting daredevils in binger who had stolen out to the mound and made off with the tools i had lefteverything else on the mound was as i had left itbrush cut by my machete slight bowllike depression toward the north end and the hole i had made with my trenchknife in digging up the magnetismrevealed cylinder deeming it too great a concession to the unknown jokers to return to binger for another pick and shovel i resolved to carry out my programme as best i could with the machete and trenchknife in my handbag so extracting these i set to work excavating the bowllike depression which my eye had picked as the possible site of a former entrance to the mound as i proceeded i felt again the suggestion of a sudden wind blowing against me which i had noticed the day beforea suggestion which seemed stronger and still more reminiscent of unseen formless opposing hands laid on my wrists as i cut deeper and deeper through the roottangled red soil and reached the exotic black loam beneath the talisman around my neck appeared to twitch oddly in the breezenot in any one direction as when attracted by the buried cylinder but vaguely and diffusely in a manner wholly unaccountablethen quite without warning the black rootwoven earth beneath my feet began to sink cracklingly while i heard a faint sound of sifting falling matter far below me the obstructing wind or forces or hands now seemed to be operating from the very seat of the sinking and i felt that they aided me by pushing as i leaped back out of the hole to avoid being involved in any cavein bending down over the brink and hacking at the mouldcaked roottangle with my machete i felt that they were against me againbut at no time were they strong enough to stop my work the more roots i severed the more falling matter i heard below finally the hole began to deepen of itself toward the centre and i saw that the earth was sifting down into some large cavity beneath so as to leave a goodsized aperture when the roots that had bound it were gone a few more hacks of the machete did the trick and with a parting cavein and uprush of curiously chill and alien air the last barrier gave way under the morning sun yawned a huge opening at least three feet square and shewing the top of a flight of stone steps down which the loose earth of the collapse was still sliding my quest had come to something at last with an elation of accomplishment almost overbalancing fear for the nonce i replaced the trenchknife and machete in my handbag took out my powerful electric torch and prepared for a triumphant lone and utterly rash invasion of the fabulous nether world i had uncoveredit was rather hard getting down the first few steps both because of the fallen earth which had choked them and because of a sinister uppushing of a cold wind from below the talisman around my neck swayed curiously and i began to regret the disappearing square of daylight above me the electric torch shewed dank waterstained and saltencrusted walls fashioned of huge basalt blocks and now and then i thought i descried some trace of carving beneath the nitrous deposits i gripped my handbag more tightly and was glad of the comforting weight of the sheriffs heavy revolver in my righthand coat pocket after a time the passage began to wind this way and that and the staircase became free from obstructions carvings on the walls were now definitely traceable and i shuddered when i saw how clearly the grotesque figures resembled the monstrous basreliefs on the cylinder i had found winds and forces continued to blow malevolently against me and at one or two bends i half fancied the torch gave glimpses of thin transparent shapes not unlike the sentinel on the mound as my binoculars had shewed him when i reached this stage of visual chaos i stopped for a moment to get a grip on myself it would not do to let my nerves get the better of me at the very outset of what would surely be a trying experience and the most important archaeological feat of my careerbut i wished i had not stopped at just that place for the act fixed my attention on something profoundly disturbing it was only a small object lying close to the wall on one of the steps below me but that object was such as to put my reason to a severe test and bring up a line of the most alarming speculations that the opening above me had been closed against all material forms for generations was utterly obvious from the growth of shrubroots and accumulation of drifting soil yet the object before me was most distinctly not many generations old for it was an electric torch much like the one i now carriedwarped and encrusted in the tomblike dampness but none the less perfectly unmistakable i descended a few steps and picked it up wiping off the evil deposits on my rough coat one of the nickel bands bore an engraved name and address and i recognised it with a start the moment i made it out it read jas c williams 17 trowbridge st cambridge massand i knew that it had belonged to one of the two daring college instructors who had disappeared on june 28 1915 only thirteen years ago and yet i had just broken through the sod of centuries how had the thing got there another entranceor was there something after all in this mad idea of dematerialisation and rematerialisationdoubt and horror grew upon me as i wound still farther down the seemingly endless staircase would the thing never stop the carvings grew more and more distinct and assumed a narrative pictorial quality which brought me close to panic as i recognised many unmistakable correspondences with the history of knyan as sketched in the manuscript now resting in my handbag for the first time i began seriously to question the wisdom of my descent and to wonder whether i had not better return to the upper air before i came upon something which would never let me return as a sane man but i did not hesitate long for as a virginian i felt the blood of ancestral fighters and gentlemenadventurers pounding a protest against retreat from any peril known or unknownmy descent became swifter rather than slower and i avoided studying the terrible basreliefs and intaglios that had unnerved me all at once i saw an arched opening ahead and realised that the prodigious staircase had ended at last but with that realisation came horror in mounting magnitude for before me there yawned a vast vaulted crypt of alltoofamiliar outlinea great circular space answering in every least particular to the carvinglined chamber described in the zamacona manuscriptit was indeed the place there could be no mistake and if any room for doubt yet remained that room was abolished by what i saw directly across the great vault it was a second arched opening commencing a long narrow passage and having at its mouth two huge opposite niches bearing loathsome and titanic images of shockingly familiar pattern there in the dark unclean yig and hideous tulu squatted eternally glaring at each other across the passage as they had glared since the earliest youth of the human worldfrom this point onward i ask no credence for what i tellfor what ithinki saw it is too utterly unnatural too utterly monstrous and incredible to be any part of sane human experience or objective reality my torch though casting a powerful beam ahead naturally could not furnish any general illumination of the cyclopean crypt so i now began moving it about to explore the giant walls little by little as i did so i saw to my horror that the space was by no means vacant but was instead littered with odd furniture and utensils and heaps of packages which bespoke a populous recent occupancyno nitrous reliques of the past but queerly shaped objects and supplies in modern everyday use as my torch rested on each article or group of articles however the distinctness of the outlines soon began to grow blurred until in the end i could scarcely tell whether the things belonged to the realm of matter or to the realm of spiritall this while the adverse winds blew against me with increasing fury and the unseen hands plucked malevolently at me and snatched at the strange magnetic talisman i wore wild conceits surged through my mind i thought of the manuscript and what it said about the garrison stationed in this placetwelve dead slaveymbhiand six living but partly dematerialised freementhat was in 1545three hundred and eightythree years ago what since then zamacona had predicted change subtle disintegration more dematerialisation weaker and weaker was it grey eagles talisman that held them at baytheir sacred tulumetaland were they feebly trying to pluck it off so that they might do to me what they had done to those who had come before it occurred to me with shuddering force that i was building my speculations out of a full belief in the zamacona manuscriptthis must not bei must get a grip on myselfbut curse it every time i tried to get a grip i saw some fresh sight to shatter my poise still further this time just as my will power was driving the halfseen paraphernalia into obscurity my glance and torchbeam had to light on two things of very different nature two things of the eminently real and sane world yet they did more to unseat my shaky reason than anything i had seen beforebecause i knew what they were and knew how profoundly in the course of nature they ought not to be therethey were my own missing pick and shovel side by side and leaning neatly against the blasphemously carved wall of that hellish cryptgod in heavenand i had babbled to myself about daring jokers from bingerthat was the last straw after that the cursed hypnotism of the manuscript got at me and i actuallysawthe halftransparent shapes of the things that were pushing and plucking pushing and pluckingthose leprous palaeogean things with something of humanity still clinging to themthecompleteforms and the forms that were morbidly and perverselyincomplete all these and hideousother entitiesthe fourfooted blasphemies with apelike face and projecting horn and not a sound so far in all that nitrous hell of inner earth then therewasa sounda flopping a padding a dull advancing sound which heralded beyond question a being as structurally material as the pickaxe and the shovelsomething wholly unlike the shadowshapes that ringed me in yet equally remote from any sort of life as life is understood on the earths wholesome surface my shattered brain tried to prepare me for what was coming but could not frame any adequate image i could only say over and over again to myself it is of the abyss but it isnotdematerialised the padding grew more distinct and from the mechanical cast of the tread i knew it was a dead thing that stalked in the darkness thenoh god i saw it in the full beam of my torch saw it framed like a sentinel in the narrow passage between the nightmare idols of the serpent yig and the octopus tulu let me collect myself enough to hint at what i saw to explain why i dropped torch and handbag and fled emptyhanded in the utter blackness wrapped in a merciful unconsciousness which did not wear off until the sun and the distant yelling and the shouting from the village roused me as i lay gasping on the top of the accursed mound i do not yet know what guided me again to the earths surface i only know that the watchers in binger saw me stagger up into sight three hours after i had vanished saw me lurch up and fall flat on the ground as if struck by a bullet none of them dared to come out and help me but they knew i must be in a bad state so tried to rouse me as best they could by yelling in chorus and firing off revolversit worked in the end and when i came to i almost rolled down the side of the mound in my eagerness to get away from that black aperture which still yawned open my torch and tools and the handbag with the manuscript were all down there but it is easy to see why neither i nor anyone else ever went after them when i staggered across the plain and into the village i dared not tell what i had seen i only muttered vague things about carvings and statues and snakes and shaken nerves and i did not faint again until somebody mentioned that the ghostsentinel had reappeared about the time i had staggered half way back to town i left binger that evening and have never been there since though they tell me the ghosts still appear on the mound as usualbut i have resolved to hint here at last what i dared not hint to the people of binger on that terrible august afternoon i dont know yet just how i can go about itand if in the end you think my reticence strange just remember that to imagine such a horror is one thingbut to see it is another thingi saw it i think youll recall my citing early in this tale the case of a bright young man named heaton who went out to that mound one day in 1891 and came back at night as the village idiot babbling for eight years about horrors and then dying in an epileptic fit what he used to keep moaning was that white manoh my god what they did to him well i saw the same thing that poor heaton sawand i saw it after reading the manuscript so i know more of its history than he did that makes it worsefor i know all that itimpliesall that must be still brooding and festering and waiting down there i told you it had padded mechanically toward me out of the narrow passage and had stood sentrylike at the entrance between the frightful eidola of yig and tulu that was very natural and inevitablebecause the thingwasa sentry it had been made a sentry for punishment and it was quite deadbesides lacking head arms lower legs and other customary parts of a human being yesit had been a very human being once and what is more it had beenwhitevery obviously if that manuscript was as true as i think it was this being had been used for thediversions of the amphitheatrebefore its life had become wholly extinct and supplanted by automatic impulses controlled from outsideon its white and only slightly hairy chest some letters had been gashed or brandedi had not stopped to investigate but had merely noted that they were in an awkward and fumbling spanish an awkward spanish implying a kind of ironic use of the language by an alien inscriber familiar

body of tlayub,1
i have examined maps of the city with the greatest care yet have never again found the rue dauseil these maps have not been modern maps alone for i know that names change i have on the contrary delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place and have personally explored every region of whatever name which could possibly answer to the street i knew as the rue dauseil but despite all i have done it remains an humiliating fact that i cannot find the house the street or even the locality where during the last months of my impoverished life as a student of metaphysics at the university i heard the music of erich zannthat my memory is broken i do not wonder for my health physical and mental was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in the rue dauseil and i recall that i took none of my few acquaintances there but that i cannot find the place again is both singular and perplexing for it was within a halfhours walk of the university and was distinguished by peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by anyone who had been there i have never met a person who has seen the rue dauseilthe rue dauseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blearwindowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone it was always shadowy along that river as if the smoke of neighbouring factories shut out the sun perpetually the river was also odorous with evil stenches which i have never smelled elsewhere and which may some day help me to find it since i should recognise them at once beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets with rails and then came the ascent at first gradual but incredibly steep as the rue dauseil was reachedi have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the rue dauseil it was almost a cliff closed to all vehicles consisting in several places of flights of steps and ending at the top in a lofty ivied wall its paving was irregular sometimes stone slabs sometimes cobblestones and sometimes bare earth with struggling greenishgrey vegetation the houses were tall peakedroofed incredibly old and crazily leaning backward forward and sidewise occasionally an opposite pair both leaning forward almost met across the street like an arch and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below there were a few overhead bridges from house to house across the streetthe inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly at first i thought it was because they were all silent and reticent but later decided it was because they were all very old i do not know how i came to live on such a street but i was not myself when i moved there i had been living in many poor places always evicted for want of money until at last i came upon that tottering house in the rue dauseil kept by the paralytic blandot it was the third house from the top of the street and by far the tallest of them allmy room was on the fifth story the only inhabited room there since the house was almost empty on the night i arrived i heard strange music from the peaked garret overhead and the next day asked old blandot about it he told me it was an old german violplayer a strange dumb man who signed his name as erich zann and who played evenings in a cheap theatre orchestra adding that zanns desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyondthereafter i heard zann every night and although he kept me awake i was haunted by the weirdness of his music knowing little of the art myself i was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music i had heard before and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius the longer i listened the more i was fascinated until after a week i resolved to make the old mans acquaintanceone night as he was returning from his work i intercepted zann in the hallway and told him that i would like to know him and be with him when he played he was a small lean bent person with shabby clothes blue eyes grotesque satyrlike face and nearly bald head and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened my obvious friendliness however finally melted him and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark creaking and rickety attic stairs his room one of only two in the steeply pitched garret was on the west side toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street its size was very great and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary bareness and neglect of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead a dingy washstand a small table a large bookcase an iron musicrack and three oldfashioned chairs sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor the walls were of bare boards and had probably never known plaster whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited evidently erich zanns world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imaginationmotioning me to sit down the dumb man closed the door turned the large wooden bolt and lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him he now removed his viol from its motheaten covering and taking it seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs he did not employ the musicrack but offering no choice and playing from memory enchanted me for over an hour with strains i had never heard before strains which must have been of his own devising to describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music they were a kind of fugue with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes i had overheard from my room below on other occasionsthose haunting notes i had remembered and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to myself so when the player at length laid down his bow i asked him if he would render some of them as i began my request the wrinkled satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing and seemed to shew the same curious mixture of anger and fright which i had noticed when first i accosted the old man for a moment i was inclined to use persuasion regarding rather lightly the whims of senility and even tried to awaken my hosts weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which i had listened the night before but i did not pursue this course for more than a moment for when the dumb musician recognised the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis and his long cold bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation as he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the lone curtained window as if fearful of some intrudera glance doubly absurd since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs this window being the only point on the steep street as the concierge had told me from which one could see over the wall at the summitthe old mans glance brought blandots remark to my mind and with a certain capriciousness i felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop which of all the dwellers in the rue dauseil only this crabbed musician could see i moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains when with a frightened rage even greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands now thoroughly disgusted with my host i ordered him to release me and told him i would go at once his clutch relaxed and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside he tightened his relaxing grip but this time in a friendly manner forcing me into a chair then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table where he wrote many words with a pencil in the laboured french of a foreignerthe note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness zann said that he was old lonely and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with other things he had enjoyed my listening to his music and wished i would come again and not mind his eccentricities but he could not play to another his weird harmonies and could not bear hearing them from another nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another he had not known until our hallway conversation that i could overhear his playing in my room and now asked me if i would arrange with blandot to take a lower room where i could not hear him in the night he would he wrote defray the difference in rentas i sat deciphering the execrable french i felt more lenient toward the old man he was a victim of physical and nervous suffering as was i and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness in the silence there came a slight sound from the windowthe shutter must have rattled in the nightwindand for some reason i started almost as violently as did erich zann so when i had finished reading i shook my host by the hand and departed as a friend the next day blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor between the apartments of an aged moneylender and the room of a respectable upholsterer there was no one on the fourth floorit was not long before i found that zanns eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story he did not ask me to call on him and when i did call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly this was always at nightin the day he slept and would admit no one my liking for him did not grow though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me i had a curious desire to look out of that window over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there once i went up to the garret during theatre hours when zann was away but the door was lockedwhat i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man at first i would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor then i grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret there in the narrow hall outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole i often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dreadthe dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery it was not that the sounds were hideous for they were not but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which i could hardly conceive as produced by one player certainly erich zann was a genius of wild power as the weeks passed the playing grew wilder whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold he now refused to admit me at any time and shunned me whenever we met on the stairsthen one night as i listened at the door i heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was realthe awful inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish i knocked repeatedly at the door but received no response afterward i waited in the black hallway shivering with cold and fear till i heard the poor musicians feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair believing him just conscious after a fainting fit i renewed my rapping at the same time calling out my name reassuringly i heard zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash then stumble to the door which he falteringly unfastened to admit me this time his delight at having me present was real for his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mothers skirtsshaking pathetically the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor he sat for some time inactive nodding oddly but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening subsequently he seemed to be satisfied and crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note handed it to me and returned to the table where he began to write rapidly and incessantly the note implored me in the name of mercy and for the sake of my own curiosity to wait where i was while he prepared a full account in german of all the marvels and terrors which beset him i waited and the dumb mans pencil flewit was perhaps an hour later while i still waited and while the old musicians feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up that i saw zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock unmistakably he was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly then i half fancied i heard a sound myself though it was not a horrible sound but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note suggesting a player in one of the neighbouring houses or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which i had never been able to look upon zann the effect was terrible for dropping his pencil suddenly he rose seized his viol and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing i had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred doorit would be useless to describe the playing of erich zann on that dreadful night it was more horrible than anything i had ever overheard because i could now see the expression of his face and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear he was trying to make a noise to ward something off or drown something outwhat i could not imagine awesome though i felt it must be the playing grew fantastic delirious and hysterical yet kept to the last the qualities of supreme genius which i knew this strange old man possessed i recognised the airit was a wild hungarian dance popular in the theatres and i reflected for a moment that this was the first time i had ever heard zann play the work of another composerlouder and louder wilder and wilder mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol the player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and twisted like a monkey always looking frantically at the curtained window in his frenzied strains i could almost see shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning and then i thought i heard a shriller steadier note that was not from the viol a calm deliberate purposeful mocking note from far away in the westat this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling nightwind which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within zanns screaming viol now outdid itself emitting sounds i had never thought a viol could emit the shutter rattled more loudly unfastened and commenced slamming against the window then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts and the chill wind rushed in making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where zann had begun to write out his horrible secret i looked at zann and saw that he was past conscious observation his blue eyes were bulging glassy and sightless and the frantic playing had become a blind mechanical unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggesta sudden gust stronger than the others caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the window i followed the flying sheets in desperation but they were gone before i reached the demolished panes then i remembered my old wish to gaze from this window the only window in the rue dauseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall and the city outspread beneath it was very dark but the citys lights always burned and i expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind yet when i looked from that highest of all gable windows looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the nightwind i saw no city spread below and no friendly lights gleaming from remembered streets but only the blackness of space illimitable unimagined space alive with motion and music and having no semblance to anything on earth and as i stood there looking in terror the wind blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me and the daemon madness of that nightbaying viol behind mei staggered back in the dark without the means of striking a light crashing against the table overturning a chair and finally groping my way to the place where the blackness screamed with shocking music to save myself and erich zann i could at least try whatever the powers opposed to me once i thought some chill thing brushed me and i screamed but my scream could not be heard above that hideous viol suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me and i knew i was close to the player i felt ahead touched the back of zanns chair and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to his senseshe did not respond and still the viol shrieked on without slackening i moved my hand to his head whose mechanical nodding i was able to stop and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night but he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy of his unutterable music while all through the garret strange currents of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and babel when my hand touched his ear i shuddered though i knew not whyknew not why till i felt of the still face the icecold stiffened unbreathing face whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void and then by some miracle finding the door and the large wooden bolt i plunged wildly away from that glassyeyed thing in the dark and from the ghoulish howling of that accursed viol whose fury increased even as i plungedleaping floating flying down those endless stairs through the dark house racing mindlessly out into the narrow steep and ancient street of steps and tottering houses clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid canyonwalled river panting across the great dark bridge to the broader healthier streets and boulevards we know all these are terrible impressions that linger with me and i recall that there was no wind and that the moon was out and that all the lights of the city twinkleddespite my most careful searches and investigations i have never since been able to find the rue dauseil but i am not wholly sorry either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely written sheets which alone could have explained the music of erich zann,1

when i drew nigh the nameless city i knew it was accursed i was travelling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon and afar i saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an illmade grave fear spoke from the ageworn stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge this greatgrandmother of the eldest pyramid and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see and no man else had ever dared to seeremote in the desert of araby lies the nameless city crumbling and inarticulate its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages it must have been thus before the first stones of memphis were laid and while the bricks of babylon were yet unbaked there is no legend so old as to give it a name or to recall that it was ever alive but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why it was of this place that abdul alhazred the mad poet dreamed on the night before he sang his unexplainable coupletthat is not dead which can eternal lieand with strange aeons even death may diei should have known that the arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man yet i defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel i alone have seen it and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine why no other man shivers so horribly when the nightwind rattles the windows when i came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at me chilly from the rays of a cold moon amidst the deserts heat and as i returned its look i forgot my triumph at finding it and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawnfor hours i waited till the east grew grey and the stars faded and the grey turned to roseal light edged with gold i heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky was clear and the vast reaches of the desert still then suddenly above the deserts far rim came the blazing edge of the sun seen through the tiny sandstorm which was passing away and in my fevered state i fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal to hail the fiery disc as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile my ears rang and my imagination seethed as i led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal stone place that place too old for egypt and mero to remember that place which i alone of living men had seenin and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces i wandered finding never a carving or inscription to tell of those men if men they were who built the city and dwelt therein so long ago the antiquity of the spot was unwholesome and i longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind there were certainproportionsanddimensionsin the ruins which i did not like i had with me many tools and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices but progress was slow and nothing significant was revealed when night and the moon returned i felt a chill wind which brought new fear so that i did not dare to remain in the city and as i went outside the antique walls to sleep a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert stilli awaked just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams my ears ringing as from some metallic peal i saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape once more i ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race at noon i rested and in the afternoon i spent much time tracing the walls and the bygone streets and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings i saw that the city had been mighty indeed and wondered at the sources of its greatness to myself i pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that chaldaea could not recall it and thought of sarnath the doomed that stood in the land of mnar when mankind was young and of ib that was carven of grey stone before mankind existedall at once i came upon a place where the bedrock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff and here i saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small squat rock houses or temples whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation though sandstorms had long since effaced any carvings which may have been outsidevery low and sandchoked were all of the dark apertures near me but i cleared one with my spade and crawled through it carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold when i was inside i saw that the cavern was indeed a temple and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert primitive altars pillars and niches all curiously low were not absent and though i saw no sculptures nor frescoes there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means the lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange for i could hardly more than kneel upright but the area was so great that my torch shewed only part at a time i shuddered oddly in some of the far corners for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible revolting and inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple when i had seen all that the place contained i crawled out again avid to find what the other temples might yieldnight had now approached yet the tangible things i had seen made curiosity stronger than fear so that i did not flee from the long mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first i saw the nameless city in the twilight i cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it finding more vague stones and symbols though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained the room was just as low but much less broad ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines about these shrines i was prying when the noise of a wind and of my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beastthe moon was gleaming vividly over the primeval ruins lighting a dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me i knew it was this chilly sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when i chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff this astonished me and made me fearful again but i immediately recalled the sudden local winds i had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset and judged it was a normal thing i decided that it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me almost out of sight against the choking sandcloud i plodded toward this temple which as i neared it loomed larger than the rest and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand i would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch it poured madly out of the dark door sighing uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread about the weird ruins soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still till finally all was at rest again but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city and when i glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters i was more afraid than i could explain but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder so as soon as the wind was quite gone i crossed into the dark chamber from which it had comethis temple as i had fancied from the outside was larger than either of those i had visited before and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds from some region beyond here i could stand quite upright but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples on the walls and roof i beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away and on two of the altars i saw with rising excitement a maze of wellfashioned curvilinear carvings as i held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was too regular to be natural and i wondered what the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon their engineering skill must have been vastthen a brighter flare of the fantastic flame shewed me that for which i had been seeking the opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown and i grew faint when i saw that it was a small and plainlyartificialdoor chiselled in the solid rock i thrust my torch within beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small numerous and steeply descending steps i shall always see those steps in my dreams for i came to learn what they meant at the time i hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere footholds in a precipitous descent my mind was whirling with mad thoughts and the words and warnings of arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the lands that men know to the nameless city that men dare not know yet i hesitated only a moment before advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage feet first as though on a ladderit is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have had such a descent as mine the narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well and the torch i held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which i was crawling i lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch though i was frightened when i thought of the distance i must be traversing there were changes of direction and of steepness and once i came to a long low level passage where i had to wriggle feet first along the rocky floor holding my torch at arms length beyond my head the place was not high enough for kneeling after that were more of the steep steps and i was still scrambling down interminably when my failing torch died out i do not think i noticed it at the time for when i did notice it i was still holding it high above me as if it were ablaze i was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and the unknown which has made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of far ancient and forbidden placesin the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished treasury of daemoniac lore sentences from alhazred the mad arab paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of damascius and infamous lines from the deliriousimage du mondeof gauthier de metz i repeated queer extracts and muttered of afrasiab and the daemons that floated with him down the oxus later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of lord dunsanys talesthe unreverberate blackness of the abyss once when the descent grew amazingly steep i recited something in singsong from thomas moore until i feared to recite morea reservoir of darkness blackas witches cauldrons are when filldwith moondrugs in th eclipse distilldleaning to look if foot might passdown thro that chasm i saw beneathas far as vision could explorethe jetty sides as smooth as glasslooking as if just varnishd oerwith that dark pitch the sea of deaththrows out upon its slimy shoretime had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor and i found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head i could not quite stand but could kneel upright and in the dark i shuffled and crept hither and thither at random i soon knew that i was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts as in that palaeozoic and abysmal place i felt of such things as polished wood and glass i shuddered at the possible implications the cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals and were oblong and horizontal hideously like coffins in shape and size when i tried to move two or three for further examination i found they were firmly fastenedi saw that the passage was a long one so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched on man is so used to thinking visually that i almost forgot the darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its lowstudded monotony as though i saw it and then in a moment of indescribable emotion i did see itjust when my fancy merged into real sight i cannot tell but there came a gradual glow ahead and all at once i knew that i saw the dim outlines of the corridor and the cases revealed by some unknown subterranean phosphorescence for a little while all was exactly as i had imagined it since the glow was very faint but as i mechanically kept on stumbling ahead into the stronger light i realised that my fancy had been but feeble this hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art rich vivid and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural painting whose lines and colours were beyond description the cases were of a strange golden wood with fronts of exquisite glass and contained the mummified forms of creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of manto convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible they were of the reptile kind with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile sometimes the seal but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard in size they approximated a small man and their fore legs bore delicate and evidently flexible feet curiously like human hands and fingers but strangest of all were their heads which presented a contour violating all known biological principles to nothing can such things be well comparedin one flash i thought of comparisons as varied as the cat the bulldog the mythic satyr and the human being not jove himself had so colossal and protuberant a forehead yet the horns and the noselessness and the alligatorlike jaw placed the things outside all established categories i debated for a time on the reality of the mummies half suspecting they were artificial idols but soon decided they were indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive to crown their grotesqueness most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold jewels and unknown shining metalsthe importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast for they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling with matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of their own wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their dimensions and i could not but think that their pictured history was allegorical perhaps shewing the progress of the race that worshipped them these creatures i said to myself were to the men of the nameless city what the shewolf was to rome or some totembeast is to a tribe of indiansholding this view i thought i could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the world before africa rose out of the waves and of its struggles as the sea shrank away and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held it i saw its wars and triumphs its troubles and defeats and afterward its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its peoplehere represented in allegory by the grotesque reptileswere driven to chisel their way down through the rocks in some marvellous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them it was all vividly weird and realistic and its connexion with the awesome descent i had made was unmistakable i even recognised the passagesas i crept along the corridor toward the brighter light i saw later stages of the painted epicthe leavetaking of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so long where they had settled as nomads in the earths youth hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they never ceased to worship now that the light was better i studied the pictures more closely and remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the unknown men pondered upon the customs of the nameless city many things were peculiar and inexplicable the civilisation which included a written alphabet had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilisations of egypt and chaldaea yet there were curious omissions i could for example find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs save such as were related to wars violence and plagues and i wondered at the reticence shewn concerning natural death it was as though an ideal of earthly immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusionstill nearer the end of the passage were painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and extravagance contrasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin and of the strange new realm or paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone in these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by moonlight a golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls and half revealing the splendid perfection of former times shewn spectrally and elusively by the artist the paradisal scenes were almost too extravagant to be believed portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys at the very last i thought i saw signs of an artistic anticlimax the paintings were less skilful and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes they seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert the forms of the peoplealways represented by the sacred reptilesappeared to be gradually wasting away though their spirit as shewn hovering about the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion emaciated priests displayed as reptiles in ornate robes cursed the upper air and all who breathed it and one terrible final scene shewed a primitivelooking man perhaps a pioneer of ancient irem the city of pillars torn to pieces by members of the elder race i remembered how the arabs fear the nameless city and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling were bareas i viewed the pageant of mural history i had approached very closely the end of the lowceiled hall and was aware of a great gate through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence creeping up to it i cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance such as one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of mount everest upon a sea of sunlit mist behind me was a passage so cramped that i could not stand upright in it before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgencereaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of stepssmall numerous steps like those of the black passages i had traversedbut after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything swung back open against the lefthand wall of the passage was a massive door of brass incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic basreliefs which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock i looked at the steps and for the nonce dared not try them i touched the open brass door and could not move it then i sank prone to the stone floor my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a deathlike exhaustion could banishas i lay still with closed eyes free to ponder many things i had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significancescenes representing the nameless city in its heyday the vegetation of the valley around it and the distant lands with which its merchants traded the allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence and i wondered that it should be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance in the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles i wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been and reflected a moment on certain oddities i had noticed in the ruins i thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling perhaps the very rites had involved a crawling in imitation of the creatures no religious theory however could easily explain why the level passage in that awesome descent should be as low as the templesor lower since one could not even kneel in it as i thought of the crawling creatures whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me i felt a new throb of fear mental associations are curious and i shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of primordial lifebut as always in my strange and roving existence wonder soon drove out fear for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest explorer that a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps i could not doubt and i hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give the frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities hills and valleys in this lower realm and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited memy fears indeed concerned the past rather than the future not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes miles below the world i knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist could match the lethal dread i felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul an ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rockhewn temples in the nameless city while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten with only here and there some vaguely familiar outline of what could have happened in the geological aeons since the paintings ceased and the deathhating race resentfully succumbed to decay no man might say life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond now i was alone with vivid relics and i trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent and deserted vigilsuddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since i first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon and despite my exhaustion i found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world my sensations were much like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night and were as inexplicable as they were poignant in another moment however i received a still greater shock in the form of a definite soundthe first which had broken the utter silence of these tomblike depths it was a deep low moaning as of a distant throng of condemned spirits and came from the direction in which i was staring its volume rapidly grew till soon it reverberated frightfully through the low passage and at the same time i became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above the touch of this air seemed to restore my balance for i instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise one of which had indeed served to reveal the hidden tunnels to me i looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near so braced myself to resist the gale which was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening my fear again waned low since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknownmore and more madly poured the shrieking moaning nightwind into that gulf of the inner earth i dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss such fury i had not expected and as i grew aware of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss i was beset by a thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination the malignancy of the blast awakened incredible fancies once more i compared myself shudderingly to the only other human image in that frightful corridor the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race for in the fiendish clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent i think i screamed frantically near the lasti was almost madbut if i did so my cries were lost in the hellborn babel of the howling windwraiths i tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent but i could not even hold my own as i was pushed slowly and inexorably toward the unknown world finally reason must have wholly snapped for i fell to babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad arab alhazred who dreamed of the nameless citythat is not dead which can eternal lieand with strange aeons even death may dieonly the grim brooding desert gods know what really took placewhat indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark i endured or what abaddon guided me back to life where i must always remember and shiver in the nightwind till oblivionor worseclaims me monstrous unnatural colossal was the thingtoo far beyond all the ideas of man to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours when one cannot sleepi have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernalcacodaemoniacaland that its voices were hideous with the pentup viciousness of desolate eternities presently those voices while still chaotic before me seemed to my beating brain to take articulate form behind me and down there in the grave of unnumbered aeondead antiquities leagues below the dawnlit world of men i heard the ghastly cursing and snarling of strangetongued fiends turning i saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss what could not be seen against the dusk of the corridora nightmare horde of rushing devils hatedistorted grotesquely panoplied halftransparent devils of a race no man might mistakethe crawling reptiles of the nameless cityand as the wind died away i was plunged into the ghoulpeopled blackness of earths bowels for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile,1
i went to ellston beach not only for the pleasures of sun and ocean but to rest a weary mind since i knew no person in the little town which thrives on summer vacationists and presents only blank windows during most of the year there seemed no likelihood that i might be disturbed this pleased me for i did not wish to see anything but the expanse of pounding surf and the beach lying before my temporary homemy long work of the summer was completed when i left the city and the large mural design produced by it had been entered in the contest it had taken me the bulk of the year to finish the painting and when the last brush was cleaned i was no longer reluctant to yield to the claims of health and find rest and seclusion for a time indeed when i had been a week on the beach i recalled only now and then the work whose success had so recently seemed allimportant there was no longer the old concern with a hundred complexities of colour and ornament no longer the fear and mistrust of my ability to render a mental image actual and turn by my own skill alone the dimconceived idea into the careful draught of a design and yet that which later befell me by the lonely shore may have grown solely from the mental constitution behind such concern and fear and mistrust for i have always been a seeker a dreamer and a ponderer on seeking and dreaming and who can say that such a nature does not open latent eyes sensitive to unsuspected worlds and orders of beingnow that i am trying to tell what i saw i am conscious of a thousand maddening limitations things seen by the inward sight like those flashing visions which come as we drift into the blankness of sleep are more vivid and meaningful to us in that form than when we have sought to weld them with reality set a pen to a dream and the colour drains from it the ink with which we write seems diluted with something holding too much of reality and we find that after all we cannot delineate the incredible memory it is as if our inward selves released from the bonds of daytime and objectivity revelled in prisoned emotions which are hastily stifled when we would translate them in dreams and visions lie the greatest creations of man for on them rests no yoke of line or hue forgotten scenes and lands more obscure than the golden world of childhood spring into the sleeping mind to reign until awakening puts them to rout amid these may be attained something of the glory and contentment for which we yearn some adumbration of sharp beauties suspected but not before revealed which are to us as the grail to holy spirits of the mediaeval world to shape these things on the wheel of art to seek to bring some faded trophy from that intangible realm of shadow and gossamer requires equal skill and memory for although dreams are in all of us few hands may grasp their mothwings without tearing themsuch skill this narrative does not have if i might i would reveal to you the hinted events which i perceived dimly like one who peers into an unlit realm and glimpses forms whose motion is concealed in my mural design which then lay with a multitude of others in the building for which they were planned i had striven equally to catch a trace of this elusive shadowworld and had perhaps succeeded better than i shall now succeed my stay in ellston was to await the judging of that design and when days of unfamiliar leisure had given me perspective i discovered thatin spite of those weaknesses which a creator always detects most clearlyi had indeed managed to retain in line and colour some fragments snatched from the endless world of imagining the difficulties of the process and the resulting strain on all my powers had undermined my health and brought me to the beach during this period of waitingsince i wished to be wholly alone i rented to the delight of the incredulous owner a small house some distance from the village of ellstonwhich because of the waning season was alive with a moribund bustle of tourists uniformly uninteresting to me the house dark from the seawind though it had not been painted was not even a satellite of the village but swung below it on the coast like a pendulum beneath a still clock quite alone upon a hill of weedgrown sand like a solitary warm animal it crouched facing the sea and its inscrutable dirty windows stared upon a lonely realm of earth and sky and enormous sea it will not do to use too much imagining in a narrative whose facts could they be augmented and fitted into a mosaic would be strange enough in themselves but i thought the little house was lonely when i saw it and that like myself it was conscious of its meaningless nature before the great seai took the place in late august arriving a day before i was expected and encountering a van and two workingmen unloading the furniture provided by the owner i did not know then how long i would stay and when the truck that brought the goods had left i settled my small luggage and locked the door feeling very proprietary about having a house after months of a rented room to go down the weedy hill and on the beach since it was quite square and had but one room the house required little exploration two windows in each side provided a great quantity of light and somehow a door had been squeezed in as an afterthought on the oceanward wall the place had been built about ten years previously but on account of its distance from ellston village was difficult to rent even during the active summer season there being no fireplace it stood empty and alone from october until far into spring though actually less than a mile below ellston it seemed more remote since a bend in the coast caused one to see only grassy dunes in the direction of the villagethe first day halfgone when i was installed i spent in the enjoyment of sun and restless waterthings whose quiet majesty made the designing of murals seem distant and tiresome but this was the natural reaction to a long concern with one set of habits and activities i was through with my work and my vacation was begun this fact while elusive for the moment showed in everything which surrounded me that afternoon of my arrival and in the utter change from old scenes there was an effect of bright sun upon a shifting sea of waves whose mysteriously impelled curves were strewn with what appeared to be rhinestones perhaps a watercolour might have caught the solid masses of intolerable light which lay upon the beach where the sea mingled with the sand although the ocean bore her own hue it was dominated wholly and incredibly by the enormous glare there was no other person near me and i enjoyed the spectacle without the annoyance of any alien object upon the stage each of my senses was touched in a different way but sometimes it seemed that the roar of the sea was akin to that great brightness or as if the waves were glaring instead of the sun each of these being so vigorous and insistent that impressions coming from them were mingled curiously i saw no one bathing near my little square house during that or succeeding afternoons although the curving shore included a wide beach even more inviting than that at the village where the surf was dotted with random figures i supposed that this was because of the distance and because there had never been other houses below the town why this unbuilt stretch existed i could not imagine since many dwellings straggled along the northward coast facing the sea with aimless eyesi swam until the afternoon had gone and later having rested walked into the little town darkness hid the sea from me as i entered and i found in the dingy lights of the streets tokens of a life which was not even conscious of the great gloomshrouded thing lying so close there were painted women in tinsel adornments and bored men who were no longer younga throng of foolish marionettes perched on the lip of the oceanchasm unseeing unwilling to see what lay above them and about in the multitudinous grandeur of the stars and the leagues of the night ocean i walked along that darkened sea as i went back to the bare little house sending the beams of my flashlight out upon the naked and impenetrable void in the absence of the moon this light made a solid bar athwart the walls of the uneasy tide and i felt an indescribable emotion born of the noise of the waters and the perception of my inconceivable smallness as i cast that tiny beam upon a realm immense in itself yet only the black border of the earthly deep that nighted deep upon which ships were moving alone in the darkness where i could not see them gave off the murmur of a distant angry rabblewhen i reached my high residence i knew that i had passed no one during the miles walk from the village and yet there somehow lingered an impression that i had been all the while accompanied by the spirit of the lonely sea it was i thought personified in a shape which was not revealed to me but which moved quietly about beyond my range of comprehension it was like those actors who wait behind darkened scenery in readiness for the lines which will shortly call them before our eyes to move and speak in the sudden revelation of the footlights at last i shook off this fancy and sought my key to enter the place whose bare walls gave a sudden feeling of securitymy cottage was entirely free of the village as if it had wandered down the coast and was unable to return and there i heard nothing of the disturbing clamour when i returned each night after supper i generally stayed but a short while upon the streets of ellston though sometimes i went into the place for the sake of the walk it provided there were all the multitude of curioshops and falsely regal theaterfronts that clutter vacation towns but i never went into these and the place seemed useful only for its restaurants it was astonishing the number of useless things people found to dothere was a succession of sunfilled days at first i rose early and beheld the grey sky agleam with promise of sunrise a prophecy fulfilled as i stood witness those dawns were cold and their colours faint in comparison to that uniform radiance of day which gives to every hour the quality of white noon that great light so apparent the first day made each succeeding day a yellow page in the book of time i noticed that many of the beachpeople were displeased by the inordinate sun whereas i sought it after grey months of toil the lethargy induced by a physical existence in a region governed by the simple thingsthe wind and light and waterhad a prompt effect upon me and since i was anxious to continue this healing process i spent all my time outdoors in the sunlight this induced a state at once impassive and submissive and gave me a feeling of security against the ravenous night as darkness is akin to death so is light to vitality through the heritage of a million years ago when men were closer to the mother sea and when the creatures of which we are born lay languid in the shallow sunpierced water we still seek the primal things when we are tired steeping ourselves within their lulling security like those early halfmammals which had not yet ventured upon the oozy landthe monotony of the waves gave repose and i had no other occupation than witnessing a myriad ocean moods there is a ceaseless change in the waterscolours and shades pass over them like the insubstantial expressions of a wellknown face and these are at once communicated to us by halfrecognized senses when the sea is restless remembering old ships that have gone over her chasms there comes up silently in our hearts the longing for a vanished horizon but when she forgets we forget also though we know her a lifetime she must always hold an alien air as if something too vast to have shape were lurking in the universe to which she is a door the morning ocean glimmering with a reflected mist of bluewhite cloud and expanding diamond foam has the eyes of one who ponders on strange things and her intricately woven webs through which dart a myriad coloured fishes hold the air of some great idle thing which will arise presently from the hoary immemorial chasms and stride upon the landi was content for many days and glad that i had chosen the lonely house which sat like a small beast upon those rounded cliffs of sand among the pleasantly aimless amusements fostered by such a life i took to following the edge of the tide where the waves left a damp irregular outline rimmed with evanescent foam for long distances and sometimes i found curious bits of shell in the chance litter of the sea there was an astonishing lot of debris on that inwardcurving coast which my bare little house overlooked and i judged that currents whose courses diverge from the village beach must reach that spot at any rate my pocketswhen i had anygenerally held vast stores of trash most of which i threw away an hour or two after picking it up wondering why i had kept it once however i found a small bone whose nature i could not identify save that it was certainly nothing out of a fish and i kept this along with a large metal bead whose minutely carven design was rather unusual this latter depicted a fishy thing against a patterned background of seaweed instead of the usual floral or geometrical designs and was still clearly traceable though worn with years of tossing in the surf since i had never seen anything like it i judged that it represented some fashion now forgotten of a previous year at ellston where similar fads were commoni had been there perhaps a week when the weather began a gradual change each stage of this progressive darkening was followed by another subtly intensified so that in the end the entire atmosphere surrounding me had shifted from day to evening this was more obvious to me in a series of mental impressions than in what i actually witnessed for the small house was lonely under the grey skies and there was sometimes a beating wind that came out of the ocean bearing moisture the sun was displaced by long intervals of cloudinesslayers of grey mist beyond whose unknown depth the sun lay cut off though it might glare with the old intensity above that enormous veil it could not penetrate the beach was a prisoner in a hueless vault for hours at a time as if something of the night were welling into other hoursalthough the wind was invigorating and the ocean whipped into little churning spirals of activity by the vagrant flapping i found the water growing chill so that i could not stay in it as long as i had done previously and thus i fell into the habit of long walks whichwhen i was unable to swimprovided the exercise that i was so careful to obtain these walks covered a greater range of seaedge than my previous wanderings and since the beach extended in a stretch of miles beyond the tawdry village i often found myself wholly isolated upon an endless area of sand as evening drew close when this occurred i would stride hastily along the whispering seaborder following the outline so that i should not wander inland and lose my way and sometimes when these walks were late as they grew increasingly to be i would come upon the crouching house that looked like a harbinger of the village insecure upon the windgnawed cliffs a dark blot upon the morbid hues of the ocean sunset it was more lonely than by the full light of either orb and seemed to my imagination like a mute questioning face turned toward me expectant of some action that the place was isolated i have said and this at first pleased me but in that brief evening hour when the sun left a goresplattered decline and darkness lumbered on like an expanding shapeless blot there was an alien presence about the place a spirit a mood an impression that came from the surging wind the gigantic sky and that sea which drooled blackening waves upon a beach grown abruptly strange at these times i felt an uneasiness which had no very definite cause although my solitary nature had made me long accustomed to the ancient silence and the ancient voice of nature these misgivings to which i could have put no sure name did not affect me long yet i think now that all the while a gradual consciousness of the oceans immense loneliness crept upon me a loneliness that was made subtly horrible by intimationswhich were never more than suchof some animation or sentience preventing me from being wholly alonethe noisy yellow streets of the town with their curiously unreal activity were very far away and when i went there for my evening meal mistrusting a diet entirely of my own ambiguous cooking i took increasing and quite unreasonable care that i should return to the cottage before the late darkness although i was often abroad until ten or soyou will say that such action is unreasonable that if i had feared the darkness in some childish way i would have entirely avoided it you will ask me why i did not leave the place since its loneliness was depressing me to all this i have no reply save that whatever unrest i felt whatever of remote disturbance there was to me in brief aspects of the darkening sun or in the eager saltbrittle wind or in the robe of the dark sea that lay crumpled like an enormous garment so close to me was something which had an origin half in my own heart which showed itself only at fleeting moments and which had no very long effect upon me in the recurrent days of diamond light with sportive waves flinging blue peaks at the basking shore the memory of dark moods seemed rather incredible yet only an hour or two afterward i might again experience those moods and descend to a dim region of despairperhaps these inward emotions were only a reflection of the seas own mood for although half of what we see is coloured by the interpretation placed upon it by our minds many of our feelings are shaped quite distinctly by external physical things the sea can bind us to her many moods whispering to us by the subtle token of a shadow or a gleam upon the waves and hinting in these ways of her mournfulness or rejoicing always she is remembering old things and these memories though we may not grasp them are imparted to us so that we share her gaiety or remorse since i was doing no work seeing no person that i knew i was perhaps susceptible to shades of her cryptic meaning which would have been overlooked by another the ocean ruled my life during the whole of that late summer demanding it as recompense for the healing she had brought methere were drownings at the beach that year and while i heard of these only casually such is our indifference to a death which does not concern us and to which we are not witness i knew that their details were unsavoury the people who diedsome of them swimmers of a skill beyond the averagewere sometimes not found until many days had elapsed and the hideous vengeance of the deep had scourged their rotten bodies it was as if the sea had dragged them into a chasmlair and had mulled them about in the darkness until satisfied that they were no longer of any use she had floated them ashore in a ghastly state no one seemed to know what had caused these deaths their frequency excited alarm among the timid since the undertow at ellston was not strong and since there were known to be no sharks at hand whether the bodies showed marks of any attacks i did not learn but the dread of a death which moves among the waves and comes on lone people from a lightless motionless place is a dread which men know and do not like they must quickly find a reason for such a death even if there are no sharks since sharks formed only a suspected cause and one never to my knowledge confirmed the swimmers who continued during the rest of the season were on guard against treacherous tides rather than against any possible seaanimalautumn indeed was not a great distance off and some people used this as an excuse for leaving the sea where men were snared by death and going to the security of inland fields where one cannot even hear the ocean so august ended and i had been at the beach many daysthere had been a threat of a storm since the fourth of the new month and on the sixth when i set out for a walk in the damp wind there was a mass of formless cloud colourless and oppressive above the ruffled leaden sea the motion of the wind directed toward no especial goal but stirring uneasily provided a sensation of coming animationa hint of life in the elements which might be the longexpected storm i had eaten my luncheon at ellston and though the heavens seemed the closing lid of a great casket i ventured far down the beach and away from both the town and my nolongertobeseen house as the universal grey became spotted with a carrion purplecuriously brilliant despite its sombre huei found that i was several miles from any possible shelter this however did not seem very important for despite the dark skies with their added glow of unknown presage i was in a curious mood of detachment paralleling that glowa mood which flashed through a body grown suddenly alert and sensitive to the outline of shapes and meanings that were previously dim obscurely a memory came to me suggested by the likeness of the scene to one i had imagined when a story was read to me in childhood that taleof which i had not thought for many yearsconcerned a woman who was loved by the darkbearded king of an underwater realm of blurred cliffs where fishthings lived and who was taken from the goldenhaired youth of her troth by a dark being crowned with a priestlike mitre and having the features of a withered ape what had remained in the corner of my fancy was the image of cliffs beneath the water against the hueless dusky nosky of such a realm and this though i had forgotten most of the story was recalled quite unexpectedly by the same pattern of cliff and sky which i then beheld the sight was similar to what i had imagined in a year now lost save for random incomplete impressions suggestions of this story may have lingered behind certain irritating unfinished memories and in certain values hinted to my senses by scenes whose actual worth was bafflingly small frequently in flashes of momentary perception the conditions more than the object being significant we feel that certain isolated scenes and arrangementsa feathery landscape a womans dress along the curve of a road by afternoon or the solidity of a centurydefying tree against the pale morning skyhold something precious some golden virtue that we must grasp and yet when such a scene or arrangement is viewed later or from another point we find that it has lost its value and meaning for us perhaps this is because the thing we see does not hold that elusive quality but only suggests to the mind some very different thing which remains unremembered the baffled mind not wholly sensing the cause of its flashing appreciation seizes on the object exciting it and is surprised when there is nothing of worth therein thus it was when i beheld the purpling clouds they held the stateliness and mystery of old monastery towers at twilight but their aspect was also that of the cliffs in the old fairytale suddenly reminded of this lost image i half expected to see in the finespun dirty foam and among the waves which were now as if they had been poured of flawed black glass the horrid figure of that apefaced creature wearing a mitre old with verdigris advancing from its kingdom in some lost gulf to which those waves were skyi did not see any such creature from the realm of imagining but as the chill wind veered slitting the heavens like a rustling knife there lay in the gloom of merging cloud and water only a grey object like a piece of driftwood tossing obscurely on the foam this was a considerable distance out and since it vanished shortly may not have been wood but a porpoise coming to the troubled surfacei soon found that i had stayed too long contemplating the rising storm and linking my early fancies with its grandeur for an icy rain began spotting down bringing a more uniform gloom upon a scene already too dark for the hour hurrying along the grey sand i felt the impact of cold drops upon my back and before many moments my clothing was soaked throughout at first i had run put to flight by the colourless drops whose pattern hung in long linking strands from an unseen sky but after i saw that refuge was too far to reach in anything like a dry state i slackened my pace and returned home as if i had walked under clear skies there was not much reason to hurry although i did not idle as upon previous occasions the constraining wet garments were cold upon me and with the gathering darkness and the wind that rose endlessly from the ocean i could not repress a shiver yet there was beside the discomfort of the precipitous rain an exhilaration latent in the purplish ravelled masses of cloud and the stimulated reactions of my body in a mood half of exultant pleasure from resisting the rain which streamed from me now and filled my shoes and pockets and half of strange appreciation of those morbid dominant skies which hovered with dark wings above the shifting eternal sea i tramped along the grey corridor of ellston beach more rapidly than i had expected the crouching house showed in the oblique flapping rain and all the weeds of the sand cliff writhed in accompaniment to the frantic wind as if they would uproot themselves to join the fartravelling element sea and sky had altered not at all and the scene was that which had accompanied me save that there was now painted upon it the hunching roof that seemed to bend from the assailing rain i hurried up the insecure steps and let myself into a dry room where unconsciously surprised that i was free of the nagging wind i stood for a moment with water rilling from every inch of methere are two windows in the front of that house one on each side and these face nearly straight upon the ocean which i now saw half obscured by the combined veils of the rain and of the imminent night from these windows i looked as i dressed myself in a motley array of dry garments seized from convenient hangers and from a chair too laden to sit upon i was prisoned on all sides by an unnaturally increased dusk which had filtered down at some undefined hour under cover of the storm how long i had been on the reaches of wet grey sand or what the real time was i could not tell though a moments search produced my watchfortunately left behind and thus avoiding the uniform wetness of my clothing i half guessed the hour from the dimly seen hands which were only slightly less indecipherable than the surrounding figures in another moment my sight penetrated the gloom greater in the house than beyond the bleared window and saw that it was 645there had been no one upon the beach as i came in and naturally i expected to see no further swimmers that night yet when i looked again from the window there appeared surely to be figures blotting the grime of the wet evening i counted three moving about in some incomprehensible manner and close to the house anotherwhich may not have been a person but a waveejected log for the surf was now pounding fiercely i was startled to no little degree and wondered for what purpose those hardy persons stayed out in such a storm and then i thought that perhaps like myself they had been caught unintentionally in the rain and had surrendered to the watery gusts in another moment prompted by a certain civilised hospitality which overcame my love of solitude i stepped to the door and emerged momentarily at the cost of another wetting for the rain promptly descended upon me in exultant fury on the small porch gesticulating toward the people but whether they did not see me or did not understand they made no returning signal dim in the evening they stood as if halfsurprised or as if they awaited some other action from me there was in their attitude something of that cryptic blankness signifying anything or nothing which the house wore about itself as seen in the morbid sunset abruptly there came to me a feeling that a sinister quality lurked about those unmoving figures who chose to stay in the rainy night upon a beach deserted by all people and i closed the door with a surge of annoyance which sought all too vainly to disguise a deeper emotion of fear a consuming fright that welled up from the shadows of my consciousness a moment later when i had stepped to the window there seemed to be nothing outside but the portentous night vaguely puzzled and even more vaguely frightenedlike one who has seen no alarming thing but is apprehensive of what may be found in the dark street he is soon compelled to crossi decided that i had very possibly seen no one and that the murky air had deceived methe aura of isolation about the place increased that night though just out of sight on the northward beach a hundred houses rose in the rainy darkness their light bleared and yellow above streets of polished glass like goblineyes reflected in an oily forest pool yet because i could not see them or even reach them in bad weathersince i had no car nor any way to leave the crouching house except by walking in the figurehaunted darknessi realized quite suddenly that i was to all intents alone with the dreary sea that rose and subsided unseen unkenned in the mist and the voice of the sea had become a hoarse groan like that of something wounded which shifts about before trying to risefighting away the prevalent gloom with a soiled lampfor the darkness crept in at my windows and sat peering obscurely at me from the corners like a patient animali prepared my food since i had no intention of going to the village the hour seemed incredibly advanced though it was not yet nine oclock when i went to bed darkness had come early and furtively and throughout the remainder of my stay lingered evasively over each scene and action which i beheld something had settled out of the nightsomething forever undefined but stirring a latent sense within me so that i was like a beast expecting the momentary rustle of an enemythere were hours of wind and sheets of the downpour flapped endlessly on the meagre walls barring it from me lulls came in which i heard the mumbling sea and i could guess that large formless waves jostled one another in the pallid whine of the winds and flung on the beach a spray bitter with salt yet in the very monotony of the restless elements i found a lethargic note a sound that beguiled me after a time into slumber grey and colourless as the night the sea continued its mad monologue and the wind her nagging but these were shut out by the walls of unconsciousness and for a time the night ocean was banished from a sleeping mindmorning brought an enfeebled suna sun like that which men will see when the earth is old if there are any men left a sun more weary than the shrouded moribund sky faint echo of its old image phoebus strove to pierce the ragged ambiguous clouds as i awoke at moments sending a wash of pale gold rippling across the northwestern interior of my house at others waning till it was only a luminous ball like some incredible plaything forgotten on the celestial lawn after a while the falling rainwhich must have continued throughout the previous nightsucceeded in washing away those vestiges of purple cloud which had been like the oceancliffs in an old fairytale cheated alike of the setting and rising sun that day merged with the day before as if the intervening storm had not ushered a long darkness into the world but had swollen and subsided into one long afternoon gaining heart the furtive sun exerted all his force in dispelling the old mist streaked now like a dirty window and cast it from his realm the shallow blue day advanced as those grimy wisps retreated and the loneliness which had encircled me welled back into a watchful place of retreat whence it went no farther but crouched and waitedthe ancient brightness was now once more upon the sun and the old glitter on the waves whose playful blue shapes had flocked upon that coast ere man was born and would rejoice unseen when he was forgotten in the sepulchre of time influenced by these thin assurances like one who believes the smile of friendship on an enemys features i opened my door and as it swung outward a black spot upon the inward burst of light i saw the beach washed clean of any track as if no foot before mine had disturbed the smooth sand with the quick lift of spirit that follows a period of uneasy depression i feltin a purely yielding fashion and without volitionthat my own memory was washed clean of all the mistrust and suspicion and diseaselike fear of a lifetime just as the filth of the waters edge succumbs to a particularly high tide and is carried out of sight there was a scent of soaked brackish grass like the mouldy pages of a book commingled with a sweet odour born of the hot sunlight upon inland meadows and these were borne into me like an exhilarating drink seeping and tingling through my veins as if they would convey to me something of their own impalpable nature and float me dizzily in the aimless breeze and conspiring with these things the sun continued to shower upon me like the rain of yesterday an incessant array of bright spears as if it also wished to hide that suspected background presence which moved beyond my sight and was betrayed only by a careless rustle on the borders of my consciousness or by the aspect of blank figures staring out of an ocean void that sun a fierce ball solitary in the whirlpool of infinity was like a horde of golden moths against my upturned face a bubbling white grail of fire divine and incomprehensible it withheld from me a thousand promised mirages where it granted one for the sun did actually seem to indicate realms secure and fanciful where if i but knew the path i might wander in this curious exultation such things come of our own natures for life has never yielded for one moment her secrets and it is only in our interpretation of their hinted images that we may find ecstasy or dullness according to a deliberately induced mood yet ever and again we must succumb to her deceptions believing for the moment that we may this time find the withheld joy and in this way the fresh sweetness of the wind on a morning following the haunted darkness whose evil intimations had given me a greater uneasiness than any menace to my body whispered to me of ancient mysteries only halflinked with earth and of pleasures that were the sharper because i felt that i might experience only a part of them the sun and wind and that scent that rose upon them told me of festivals of gods whose senses are a millionfold more poignant than mans and whose joys are a millionfold more subtle and prolonged these things they hinted could be mine if i gave myself wholly into their bright deceptive power and the sun a crouching god with naked celestial flesh an unknown toomighty furnace upon which eye might not look seemed almost sacred in the glow of my newly sharpened emotions the ethereal thunderous light it gave was something before which all things must worship astonished the slinking leopard in his greenchasmed forest must have paused briefly to consider its leafscattered rays and all things nurtured by it must have cherished its bright message on such a day for when it is absent in the far reaches of eternity earth will be lost and black against an illimitable void that morning in which i shared the fire of life and whose brief moment of pleasure is secure against the ravenous years was astir with the beckoning of strange things whose elusive names can never be writtenas i made my way toward the village wondering how it might look after a longneeded scrubbing by the industrious rain i saw tangled in a glimmer of sunlit moisture that was poured over it like a yellow vintage a small object like a hand some twenty feet ahead of me and touched by the repetitious foam the shock and disgust born in my startled mind when i saw that it was indeed a piece of rotten flesh overcame my new contentment and engendered a shocked suspicion that it might actually be a hand certainly no fish or part of one could assume that look and i thought i saw mushy fingers wed in decay i turned the thing over with my foot not wishing to touch so foul an object and it adhered stickily to the leather shoe as if clutching with the grasp of corruption the thing whose shape was nearly lost held too much resemblance to what i feared it might be and i pushed it into the willing grasp of a seething wave which took it from sight with an alacrity not often shown by those ravelled edges of the seaperhaps i should have reported my find yet its nature was too ambiguous to make action natural since it had been partlyeatenby some oceandwelling monstrousness i did not think it identifiable enough to form evidence of an unknown but possible tragedy the numerous drownings of course came into my mindas well as other things lacking in wholesomeness some of which remained only as possibilities whatever the stormdislodged fragment may have been and whether it were fish or some animal akin to man i have never spoken of it until now after all there was no proof that it had not merely been distorted by rottenness into that shapei approached the town sickened by the presence of such an object amidst the apparent beauty of the clean beach though it was horribly typical of the indifference of death in a nature which mingles rottenness with beauty and perhaps loves the former more in ellston i heard of no recent drowning or other mishap of the sea and found no reference to such in the columns of the local paperthe only one i read during my stayit is difficult to describe the mental state in which succeeding days found me always susceptible to morbid emotions whose dark anguish might be induced by things outside myself or might spring from the abysses of my own spirit i was ridden by a feeling which was not of fear or despair or anything akin to these but was rather a perception of the brief hideousness and underlying filth of lifea feeling partly a reflection of my internal nature and partly a result of broodings induced by that gnawed rotten object which may have been a hand in those days my mind was a place of shadowed cliffs and dark moving figures like the ancient unsuspected realm which the fairytale recalled to me i felt in brief agonies of disillusionment the gigantic blackness of this overwhelming universe in which my days and the days of my race were as nothing to the shattered stars a universe in which each action is vain and even the emotion of grief a wasted thing the hours i had previously spent in something of regained health contentment and physical wellbeing were given now as if those days of the previous week were something definitely ended to an indolence like that of a man who no longer cares to live i was engulfed by a piteous lethargic fear of some ineluctable doom which would be i felt the completed hate of the peering stars and of the black enormous waves that hoped to clasp my bones within themthe vengeance of all the indifferent horrendous majesty of the night oceansomething of the darkness and restlessness of the sea had penetrated my heart so that i lived in an unreasoning unperceiving torment a torment none the less acute because of the subtlety of its origin and the strange unmotivated quality of its vampiric existence before my eyes lay the phantasmagoria of the purpling clouds the strange silver bauble the recurrent stagnant foam the loneliness of that bleakeyed house and the mockery of the puppet town i no longer went to the village for it seemed only a travesty of life like my own soul it stood upon a dark enveloping seaa sea grown slowly hateful to me and among these images corrupt and festering dwelt that of an object whose human contours left ever smaller the doubt of what it once had beenthese scribbled words can never tell of the hideous loneliness something i did not even wish assuaged so deeply was it embedded in my heart which had insinuated itself within me mumbling of terrible and unknown things stealthily circling nearer it was not a madness rather it was a too clear and naked perception of the darkness beyond this frail existence lit by a momentary sun no more secure than ourselves a realization of futility that few can experience and ever again touch the life about them a knowledge that turn as i might battle as i might with all the remaining power of my spirit i could neither win an inch of ground from the inimical universe nor hold for even a moment the life entrusted to me fearing death as i did life burdened with a nameless dread yet unwilling to leave the scenes evoking it i awaited whatever consummating horror was shifting itself in the immense region beyond the walls of consciousnessthus autumn found me and what i had gained from the sea was lost back into it autumn on the beachesa drear time betokened by no scarlet leaf nor any other accustomed sign a frightening sea which changes not though man changes there was only a chilling of the waters in which i no longer cared to entera further darkening of the palllike sky as if eternities of snow were waiting to descend upon the ghastly waves once that descent began it would never cease but would continue beneath the white and the yellow and the crimson sun and beneath that ultimate small ruby which shall yield only to the futilities of night the once friendly waters babbled meaningfully at me and eyed me with a strange regard yet whether the darkness of the scene were a reflection of my own broodings or whether the gloom within me were caused by what lay without i could not have told upon the beach and me alike had fallen a shadow like that of a bird which flies silently overheada bird whose watching eyes we do not suspect till the image on the ground repeats the image in the sky and we look suddenly upward to find that something has been circling above us hitherto unseenthe day was in late september and the town had closed the resorts where mad frivolity ruled empty fearhaunted lives and where raddled puppets performed their summer antics the puppets were cast aside smeared with the painted smiles and frowns they had last assumed and there were not a hundred people left in the town again the gaudy stuccofronted buildings lining the shore were permitted to crumble undisturbed in the wind as the month advanced to the day of which i speak there grew in me the light of a grey infernal dawn wherein i felt some dark thaumaturgy would be completed since i feared such a thaumaturgy less than a continuance of my horrible suspicionsless than the tooelusive hints of something monstrous lurking behind the great stageit was with more speculation than actual fear that i waited unendingly for the day of horror which seemed to be nearing the day i repeat was late in september though whether the 22nd or 23rd i am uncertain such details have fled before the recollection of those uncompleted happeningsepisodes with which no orderly existence should be plagued because of the damnable suggestions and only suggestions they contain i knew the time with an intuitive distress of spirita recognition too deep for me to explain throughout those daylight hours i was expectant of the night impatient perhaps so that the sunlight passed like a halfglimpsed reflection in rippled watera day of whose events i recall nothingit was long since that portentous storm had cast a shadow over the beach and i had determined after hesitations caused by nothing tangible to leave ellston since the year was chilling and there was no return to my earlier contentment when a telegram came for me lying two days in the western union office before i was located so little was my name known saying that my design had been acceptedwinning above all others in the contesti set a date for leaving this news which earlier in the year would have affected me strongly i now received with a curious apathy it seemed as unrelated to the unreality about me as little pertinent to me as if it were directed to another person whom i did not know and whose message had come to me through some accident none the less it was that which forced me to complete my plans and leave the cottage by the shorethere were only four nights of my stay remaining when there occurred the last of those events whose meaning lies more in the darkly sinister impression surrounding them than in anything obviously threatening night had settled over ellston and the coast and a pile of soiled dishes attested both to my recent meal and to my lack of industry darkness came as i sat with a cigarette before the seaward window and it was a liquid which gradually filled the sky washing in a floating moon monstrously elevated the flat sea bordering upon the gleaming sand the utter absence of tree or figure or life of any sort and the regard of that high moon made the vastness of my surroundings abruptly clear there were only a few stars pricking through as if to accentuate by their smallness the majesty of the lunar orb and of the restless shifting tidei had stayed indoors fearing somehow to go out before the sea on such a night of shapeless portent but i heard it mumbling secrets of an incredible lore borne to me on a wind out of nowhere was the breath of some strange and palpitant lifethe embodiment of all i had felt and of all i had suspectedstirring now in the chasms of the sky or beneath the mute waves in what place this mystery turned from an ancient horrible slumber i could not tell but like one who stands by a figure lost in sleep knowing that it will awake in a moment i crouched by the windows holding a nearly burntout cigarette and faced the rising moongradually there passed into that neverstirring landscape a brilliance intensified by the overhead glimmerings and i seemed more and more under some compulsion to watch whatever might follow the shadows were draining from the beach and i felt that they took with were all which might have been a harbour for my thoughts when the hinted thing should come where any of them did remain they were ebon and blank still lumps of darkness sprawling beneath the cruel brilliant rays the endless tableau of the lunar orbdead now whatever her past was and cold as the unhuman sepulchres she bears amid the ruin of dusty centuries older than manand the seaastir perhaps with some unkenned life some forbidden sentienceconfronted me with a horrible vividness i arose and shut the window partly because of an inward prompting but mostly i think as an excuse for transferring momentarily the stream of thought no sound came to me now as i stood before the closed panes minutes or eternities were alike i was waiting like my own fearing heart and the motionless scene beyond for the token of some ineffable life i had set the lamp upon a box in the western corner of the room but the moon was brighter and her bluish rays invaded places where the lamplight was faint the ancient glow of the round silent orb lay upon the beach as it had lain for aeons and i waited in a torment of expectancy made doubly acute by the delay in fulfillment and the uncertainty of what strange completion was to comeoutside the crouching hut a white illumination suggested vague spectral forms whose unreal phantasmal motions seemed to taunt my blindness just as unheard voices mocked my eager listening for countless moments i was still as if time and the tolling of her great bell were hushed into nothingness and yet there was nothing which i might fear the moonchiselled shadows were unnatural in no contour and veiled nothing from my eyes the night was silenti knew that despite my closed windowand all the stars were fixed mournfully in a listening heaven of dark grandeur no motion from me then or word now could reveal my plight or tell of the fearracked brain imprisoned in flesh which dared not break the silence for all the torture it brought as if expectant of death and assured that nothing could serve to banish the soulperil i confronted i crouched with a forgotten cigarette in my hand a silent world gleamed beyond the cheap dirty windows and in one corner of the room a pair of dirty oars placed there before my arrival shared the vigil of my spirit the lamp burned endlessly yielding a sick light hued like a corpses flesh glancing at it now and again for the desperate distraction it gave i saw that many bubbles unaccountably rose and vanished in the kerosenefilled base curiously enough there was no heat from the wick and suddenly i became aware that the night as a whole was neither warm nor cold but strangely neutralas if all physical forces were suspended and all the laws of a calm existence disruptedthen with an unheard splash which sent from the silver water to the shore a line of ripples echoed in fear by my heart a swimming thing emerged beyond the breakers the figure may have been that of a dog a human being or something more strange it could not have known that i watchedperhaps it did not carebut like a distorted fish it swam across the mirrored stars and dived beneath the surface after a moment it came up again and this time since it was closer i saw that it was carrying something across its shoulder i knew then that it could be no animal and that it was a man or something like a man which came toward the land from a dark ocean but it swam with a horrible easeas i watched dreadfilled and passive with the fixed stare of one who awaits death in another yet knows he cannot avert it the swimmer approached the shorethough too far down the southward beach for me to discern its outlines or features obscurely loping with sparks of moonlit foam scattered by its quick gait it emerged and was lost among the inland dunesnow i was possessed by a sudden recurrence of fear which had died away in the previous moments there was a tingling coldness all over methough the room whose window i dared not open now was stuffy i thought it would be very horrible if something were to enter a window which was not closednow that i could no longer see the figure i felt that it lingered somewhere in the close shadows or peered hideously at me from whatever window i did not watch and so i turned my gaze eagerly and frantically to each successive pane dreading that i might indeed behold an intrusive regarding face yet unable to keep myself from the terrifying inspection but though i watched for hours there was no longer anything upon the beachso the night passed and with it began the ebbing of that strangenessa strangeness which had surged up like an evil brew within a pot had mounted to the very rim in a breathless moment had paused uncertainly there and had subsided taking with it whatever unknown message it had borne like the stars that promise the revelation of terrible and glorious memories goad us into worship by this deception and then impart nothing i had come frighteningly near to the capture of an old secret which ventured close to mans haunts and lurked cautiously just beyond the edge of the known yet in the end i had nothing i was given only a glimpse of the furtive thing a glimpse made obscure by the veils of ignorance i cannot even conceive what might have shown itself had i been too close to that swimmer who went shoreward instead of into the ocean i do not know what might have come if the brew had passed the rim of the pot and poured outward in a swift cascade of revelation the night ocean withheld whatever it had nurtured i shall know nothing moreeven yet i do not know why the ocean holds such a fascination for me but then perhaps none of us can solve those thingsthey exist in defiance of all explanation there are men and wise men who do not like the sea and its lapping surf on yellow shores and they think us strange who love the mystery of the ancient and unending deep yet for me there is a haunting and inscrutable glamour in all the oceans moods it is in the melancholy silver foam beneath the moons waxen corpse it hovers over the silent and eternal waves that beat on naked shores it is there when all is lifeless save for unknown shapes that glide through sombre depths and when i behold the awesome billows surging in endless strength there comes upon me an ecstasy akin to fear so that i must abase myself before this mightiness that i may not hate the clotted waters and their overwhelming beautyvast and lonely is the ocean and even as all things came from it so shall they return thereto in the shrouded depths of time none shall reign upon the earth nor shall any motion be save in the eternal waters and these shall beat on dark shores in thunderous foam though none shall remain in that dying world to watch the cold light of the enfeebled moon playing on the swirling tides and coarsegrained sand on the deeps margin shall rest only a stagnant foam gathering about the shells and bones of perished shapes that dwelt within the waters silent flabby things will toss and roll along empty shores their sluggish life extinct then all shall be dark for at last even the white moon on the distant waves shall wink out nothing shall be left neither above nor below the sombre waters and until that last millennium as after it the sea will thunder and toss throughout the dismal night,1
nyarlathotep the crawling chaos i am the last i will tell the audient void i do not recall distinctly when it began but it was months ago the general tension was horrible to a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger a danger widespread and allembracing such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night i recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard a sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places there was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasonsthe autumn heat lingered fearsomely and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknownand it was then that nyarlathotep came out of egypt who he was none could tell but he was of the old native blood and looked like a pharaoh the fellahin knelt when they saw him yet could not say why he said he had risen up out of the blackness of twentyseven centuries and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet into the lands of civilisation came nyarlathotep swarthy slender and sinister always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger he spoke much of the sciencesof electricity and psychologyand gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude men advised one another to see nyarlathotep and shuddered and where nyarlathotep went rest vanished for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges and old steeples crumbling against a sickly skyi remember when nyarlathotep came to my citythe great the old the terrible city of unnumbered crimes my friend had told me of him and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations and i burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings that what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes and i heard it hinted abroad that those who knew nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw notit was in the hot autumn that i went through the night with the restless crowds to see nyarlathotep through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room and shadowed on a screen i saw hooded forms amidst ruins and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments and i saw the world battling against blackness against the waves of destruction from ultimate space whirling churning struggling around the dimming cooling sun then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than i can tell came out and squatted on the heads and when i who was colder and more scientific than the rest mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and static electricity nyarlathotep drave us all out down the dizzy stairs into the damp hot deserted midnight streets i screamed aloud that i wasnotafraid that i never could be afraid and others screamed with me for solace we sware to one another that the citywasexactly the same and still alive and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again and laughed at the queer faces we madei believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run and again we saw a tramcar lone windowless dilapidated and almost on its side when we gazed around the horizon we could not find the third tower by the river and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top then we split up into narrow columns each of which seemed drawn in a different direction one disappeared in a narrow alley to the left leaving only the echo of a shocking moan another filed down a weedchoked subway entrance howling with a laughter that was mad my own column was sucked toward the open country and presently felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn for as we stalked out on the dark moor we beheld around us the hellish moonglitter of evil snows trackless inexplicable snows swept asunder in one direction only where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf i lingered behind for the black rift in the greenlitten snow was frightful and i thought i had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished but my power to linger was slight as if beckoned by those who had gone before i half floated between the titanic snowdrifts quivering and afraid into the sightless vortex of the unimaginablescreamingly sentient dumbly delirious only the gods that were can tell a sickened sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things halfseen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness and through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled maddening beating of drums and thin monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic tenebrous ultimate godsthe blind voiceless mindless gargoyles whose soul is nyarlathotep,1
an extemporaneous sob storyby marcus lollius proconsul of gaulsheehans pool room which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart of chicagos stockyard district is not a nice place its air freighted with a thousand odours such as coleridge may have found at cologne too seldom knows the purifying rays of the sun but fights for space with the acrid fumes of unnumbered cheap cigars and cigarettes which dangle from the coarse lips of unnumbered human animals that haunt the place day and night but the popularity of sheehans remains unimpaired and for this there is a reasona reason obvious to anyone who will take the trouble to analyse the mixed stenches prevailing there over and above the fumes and sickening closeness rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land but now happily banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent governmentthe aroma of strong wicked whiskeya precious kind of forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950sheehans is the acknowledged centre to chicagos subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attachs of the place but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignityone who shared the squalor and filth but not the importance of sheehans he was called old bugs and was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment what he had once been many tried to guess for his language and mode of utterance when intoxicated to a certain degree were such as to excite wonderment but what hewaspresented less difficultyfor old bugs in superlative degree epitomised the pathetic species known as the bum or the downandouter whence he had come no one could tell one night he had burst wildly into sheehans foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs had hung about ever since mopping floors cleaning cuspidors and glasses and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and sanehe talked but little and usually in the common jargon of the underworld but occasionally when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude whiskey would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habitus to conjecture that he had seen better days one steady patrona bank defaulter under covercame to converse with him quite regularly and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day but the only tangible clue to old bugs past was a faded photograph which he constantly carried about with himthe photograph of a young woman of noble and beautiful features this he would sometimes draw from his tattered pocket carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and tenderness it was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen would be likely to know but of a lady of breeding and quality garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before old bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity he was a man of immense height probably more than six feet though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact his hair a dirty white and falling out in patches was never combed and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard which seemed always to remain at the bristling stagenever shavenyet never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers his features had perhaps been noble once but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation at one timeprobably in middle lifehe had evidently been grossly fat but now he was horribly lean the purple flesh hanging in loose pouches under his bleary eyes and upon his cheeks altogether old bugs was not pleasing to look uponthe disposition of old bugs was as odd as his aspect ordinarily he was true to the derelict typeready to do anything for a nickel or a dose of whiskey or hasheeshbut at rare intervals he shewed the traits which earned him his name then he would try to straighten up and a certain fire would creep into the sunken eyes his demeanour would assume an unwonted grace and even dignity and the sodden creatures around him would sense something of superioritysomething which made them less ready to give the usual kicks and cuffs to the poor butt and drudge at these times he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of sheehans deemed foolish and irrational but the spells would soon pass and once more old bugs would resume his eternal floorscrubbing and cuspidorcleaning but for one thing old bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishmentand that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced for their first drink the old man would then rise from the floor in anger and excitement muttering threats and warnings and seeking to dissuade the novices from embarking upon their course of seeing life as it is he would sputter and fume exploding into sesquipedalian admonitions and strange oaths and animated by a frightful earnestness which brought a shudder to more than one drugracked mind in the crowded room but after a time his alcoholenfeebled brain would wander from the subject and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to his mop or cleaningragi do not think that many of sheehans regular patrons will ever forget the day that young alfred trever came he was rather a finda rich and highspirited youth who would go the limit in anything he undertookat least that was the verdict of pete schultz sheehans runner who had come across the boy at lawrence college in the small town of appleton wisconsin trever was the son of prominent parents in appleton his father karl trever was an attorney and citizen of distinction whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her maiden name of eleanor wing alfred was himself a scholar and poet of distinction though cursed with a certain childish irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for sheehans runner he was blond handsome and spoiled vivacious and eager to taste the several forms of dissipation about which he had read and heard at lawrence he had been prominent in the mockfraternity of tappa tappa keg where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers but this immature collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him he knew deeper vices through books and he now longed to know them at first hand perhaps this tendency toward wildness had been stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he had been subjected at home for mrs trever had particular reason for training her only child with rigid severity she had in her own youth been deeply and permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by the case of one to whom she had for a time been engagedyoung galpin the fianc in question had been one of appletons most remarkable sons attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful mentality he won vast fame at the university of wisconsin and at the age of twentythree returned to appleton to take up a professorship at lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of appletons fairest and most brilliant daughter for a season all went happily till without warning the storm burst evil habits dating from a first drink taken years before in woodland seclusion made themselves manifest in the young professor and only by a hurried resignation did he escape a nasty prosecution for injury to the habits and morals of the pupils under his charge his engagement broken galpin moved east to begin life anew but before long appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from new york university where he had obtained an instructorship in english galpin now devoted his time to the library and lecture platform preparing volumes and speeches on various subjects connected withbelles lettresand always shewing a genius so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon him for his past mistakes his impassioned lectures in defence of villon poe verlaine and oscar wilde were applied to himself as well and in the short indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement at a certain cultured home on park avenue but then the blow fell a final disgrace compared to which the others had been as nothing shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in galpins reform and the young man abandoned his name and disappeared from public view rumour now and then associated him with a certain consul hasting whose work for the stage and for motionpicture companies attracted a certain degree of attention because of its scholarly breadth and depth but hasting soon disappeared from the public eye and galpin became only a name for parents to quote in warning accents eleanor wing soon celebrated her marriage to karl trever a rising young lawyer and of her former admirer retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of her only son and the moral guidance of that handsome and headstrong youth now in spite of all that guidance alfred trever was at sheehans and about to take his first drinkboss cried schultz as he entered the vilesmelling room

seemed to sense something unusual perhaps it was only some sound connected with the clicking balls of the pool tables or the rattling glasses that were brought from the cryptic regions in the rearperhaps only that plus some strange rustling of the dirty draperies at the one dingy windowbut many thought that someone in the room had gritted his teeth and drawn a very sharp breathglad to know you sheehan said trever in a quiet wellbred tone this is my first experience in a place like this but i am a student of life and dont want to miss any experience theres poetry in this sort of thing

mouth waters foranacreonticwhat n hells that several hangerson looked up as the young man went slightly beyond their depth but the bank defaulter under cover explained to them that anacreon was a gay old dog who lived many years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was just like sheehanslet me see trever continued the defaulter didnt schultz say your mother is a literary person tooyes damn it replied trever but nothing like the old teian shes one of those dull eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life nambypamby sortever heard of her she writes under her maiden name of eleanor winghere it was that old bugs dropped his mopwell heres yer stuff announced sheehan jovially as a tray of bottles and glasses was wheeled into the room good old rye an as fiery as ya kin find anyweres in chithe youths eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him it repelled him horribly and revolted all his inherited delicacy but his determination to taste life to the full remained with him and he maintained a bold front but before his resolution was put to the test the unexpected intervened old bugs springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers numbers of men or things which had been men dropped to the floor and began lapping at the puddles of spilled liquor but most remained immovable watching the unprecedented actions of the barroom drudge and derelict old bugs straightened up before the astonished trever and in a mild and cultivated voice said do not do this thing i was like you once and i did it now i am likethiswhat do you mean you damned old fool shouted trever what do you mean by interfering with a gentleman in his pleasuressheehan now recovering from his astonishment advanced and laid a heavy hand on the old waifs shoulderthis is the last time for you old bird he exclaimed furiously when a genlman wants tuh take a drink here by god he shall without you interferin now get th hell outa here afore i kick hell outa yabut sheehan had reckoned without scientific knowledge of abnormal psychology and the effects of nervous stimulus old bugs obtaining a firmer hold on his mop began to wield it like the javelin of a macedonian hoplite and soon cleared a considerable space around himself meanwhile shouting various disconnected bits of quotation among which was prominently repeated the sons of belial blown with insolence and winethe room became pandemonium and men screamed and howled in fright at the sinister being they had aroused trever seemed dazed in the confusion and shrank to the wall as the strife thickened he shall not drink he shall not drink thus roared old bugs as he seemed to run out ofor rise abovequotations policemen appeared at the door attracted by the noise but for a time they made no move to intervene trever now thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his desire to see life via the vice route edged closer to the bluecoated newcomers could he but escape and catch a train for appleton he reflected he would consider his education in dissipation quite completethen suddenly old bugs ceased to wield his javelin and stopped stilldrawing himself up more erectly than any denizen of the place had ever seen him beforeave caesar moriturus te salutohe shouted and dropped to the whiskeyreeking floor never to rise againsubsequent impressions will never leave the mind of young trever the picture is blurred but ineradicable policemen ploughed a way through the crowd questioning everyone closely both about the incident and about the dead figure on the floor sheehan especially did they ply with inquiries yet without eliciting any information of value concerning old bugs then the bank defaulter remembered the picture and suggested that it be viewed and filed for identification at police headquarters an officer bent reluctantly over the loathsome glassyeyed form and found the tissuewrapped cardboard which he passed around among the otherssome chicken leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face but those who were sober did not leer looking with respect and abashment at the delicate and spiritual features no one seemed able to place the subject and all wondered that the drugdegraded derelict should have such a portrait in his possessionthat is all but the bank defaulter who was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather uneasilyhehad seen a little deeper beneath old bugs mask of utter degradationthen the picture was passed to trever and a change came over the youth after the first start he replaced the tissue wrapping around the portrait as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place then he gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor noting its great height and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to appear now that the wretched flame of life had flickered out no he said hastily as the question was put to him he did not know the subject of the picture it was so old he added that no one now could be expected to recognise itbut alfred trever did not speak the truth as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in appleton over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of that picture and all his life he had known and loved its originalfor the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother,1
atop the tallest of earths peaks dwell the gods of earth and suffer no man to tell that he hath looked upon them lesser peaks they once inhabited but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of rock and snow driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till now only the last remains when they left their older peaks they took with them all signs of themselves save once it is said when they left a carven image on the face of the mountain which they called ngranekbut now they have betaken themselves to unknown kadath in the cold waste where no man treads and are grown stern having no higher peak whereto to flee at the coming of men they are grown stern and where once they suffered men to displace them they now forbid men to come or coming to depart it is well for men that they know not of kadath in the cold waste else they would seek injudiciously to scale itsometimes when earths gods are homesick they visit in the still night the peaks where once they dwelt and weep softly as they try to play in the olden way on remembered slopes men have felt the tears of the gods on whitecapped thurai though they have thought it rain and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawnwinds of lerion in cloudships the gods are wont to travel and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is cloudy for the gods are not lenient as of oldin ulthar which lies beyond the river skai once dwelt an old man avid to behold the gods of earth a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical books of hsan and familiar with the pnakotic manuscripts of distant and frozen lomar his name was barzai the wise and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipsebarzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on st johns eve barzai was learned in the lore of earths gods and had gained a desire to look upon their faces he believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky hathegkla on a night when he knew the gods would be therehathegkla is far in the stony desert beyond hatheg for which it is named and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple around its peak the mists play always mournfully for mists are the memories of the gods and the gods loved hathegkla when they dwelt upon it in the old days often the gods of earth visit hathegkla in their ships of cloud casting pale vapours over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb hathegkla at any time and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring ulthar with the young priest atal who was his disciple atal was only the son of an innkeeper and was sometimes afraid but barzais father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle so he had no common superstition in his blood and only laughed at the fearful cottersbarzai and atal went out of hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of peasants and talked of earths gods by their campfires at night many days they travelled and from afar saw lofty hathegkla with his aureole of mournful mist on the thirteenth day they reached the mountains lonely base and atal spoke of his fears but barzai was old and learned and had no fears so led the way boldly up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of sansu who is written of with fright in the mouldy pnakotic manuscriptsthe way was rocky and made perilous by chasms cliffs and falling stones later it grew cold and snowy and barzai and atal often slipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes finally the air grew thin and the sky changed colour and the climbers found it hard to breathe but still they toiled up and up marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around for three days they climbed higher higher and higher toward the roof of the world then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moonfor four nights no clouds came and the moon shone down cold through the thin mournful mists around the silent pinnacle then on the fifth night which was the night of the full moon barzai saw some dense clouds far to the north and stayed up with atal to watch them draw near thick and majestic they sailed slowly and deliberately onward ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers and hiding the moon and the summit from view for a long hour the watchers gazed whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless barzai was wise in the lore of earths gods and listened hard for certain sounds but atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night and feared much and when barzai began to climb higher and beckon eagerly it was long before atal would followso thick were the vapours that the way was hard and though atal followed on at last he could scarce see the grey shape of barzai on the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight barzai forged very far ahead and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than atal fearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and dauntless man nor pausing at wide black chasms that atal scarce could leap and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs slipping and stumbling and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steepsvery suddenly barzai went out of atals sight scaling a hideous cliff that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earths gods atal was far below and planning what he should do when he reached the place when curiously he noticed that the light had grown strong as if the cloudless peak and moonlit meetingplace of the gods were very near and as he scrambled on toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any he had known before then through the high mists he heard the voice of unseen barzai shouting wildly in delighti have heard the gods i have heard earths gods singing in revelry on hathegkla the voices of earths gods are known to barzai the prophet the mists are thin and the moon is bright and i shall see the gods dancing wildly on hathegkla that they loved in youth the wisdom of barzai hath made him greater than earths gods and against his will their spells and barriers are as naught barzai will behold the gods the proud gods the secret gods the gods of earth who spurn the sight of menatal could not hear the voices barzai heard but he was now close to the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds then he heard barzais voice grow shriller and louderthe mists are very thin and the moon casts shadows on the slope the voices of earths gods are high and wild and they fear the coming of barzai the wise who is greater than they the moons light flickers as earths gods dance against it i shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight the light is dimmer and the gods are afraid whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in the air as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws for though the way was steeper than ever the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face the light of the moon had strangely failed and as atal plunged upward through the mists he heard barzai the wise shrieking in the shadowsthe moon is dark and the gods dance in the night there is terror in the sky for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earths gods there is unknown magic on hathegkla for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither i am plunging hei hei at lastin the dim light i behold the gods of earthand now atal slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps heard in the dark a loathsome laughing mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares a cry wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one atrocious momenttheothergods theothergods the gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth look away go back do not see do not see the vengeance of the infinite abysses that cursed that damnable pit merciful gods of earthi am falling into the skyand as atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to jump downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights there resounded on hathegkla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of hatheg and nir and ulthar and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted and when the moon came out at last atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without sight of earths gods or of theothergodsnow it is told in the mouldy pnakotic manuscripts that sansu found naught but wordless ice and rock when he climbed hathegkla in the youth of the world yet when the men of ulthar and nir and hatheg crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of barzai the wise they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide as if the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel and the symbol was like to one that learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the pnakotic manuscripts which are too ancient to be read this they foundbarzai the wise they never found nor could the holy priest atal ever be persuaded to pray for his souls repose moreover to this day the people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses and pray by night when pale vapours hide the mountaintop and the moon and above the mists on hathegkla earths gods sometimes dance reminiscently for they know they are safe and love to come from unknown kadath in ships of cloud and play in the olden way as they did when earth was new and men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places,1
ms found among the effects of the late richard h johnson phd curator of the cabot museum of archaeology boston massiit is not likely that anyone in bostonor any alert reader elsewherewill ever forget the strange affair of the cabot museum the newspaper publicity given to that hellish mummy the antique and terrible rumours vaguely linked with it the morbid wave of interest and cult activities during 1932 and the frightful fate of the two intruders on december 1st of that year all combined to form one of those classic mysteries which go down for generations as folklore and become the nuclei of whole cycles of horrific speculationeveryone seems to realise too that something very vital and unutterably hideous was suppressed in the public accounts of the culminant horrors those first disquieting hints as to theconditionof one of the two bodies were dismissed and ignored too abruptlynor were the singularmodificationsin the mummy given the followingup which their news value would normally prompt it also struck people as queer that the mummy was never restored to its case in these days of expert taxidermy the excuse that its disintegrating condition made exhibition impracticable seemed a peculiarly lame oneas curator of the museum i am in a position to reveal all the suppressed facts but this i shall not do during my lifetime there are things about the world and universe which it is better for the majority not to know and i have not departed from the opinion in which all of usmuseum staff physicians reporters and policeconcurred at the period of the horror itself at the same time it seems proper that a matter of such overwhelming scientific and historic importance should not remain wholly unrecordedhence this account which i have prepared for the benefit of serious students i shall place it among various papers to be examined after my death leaving its fate to the discretion of my executors certain threats and unusual events during the past weeks have led me to believe that my lifeas well as that of other museum officialsis in some peril through the enmity of several widespread secret cults of asiatics polynesians and heterogeneous mystical devotees hence it is possible that the work of the executors may not be long postponed executors note dr johnson died suddenly and rather mysteriously of heartfailure on april 22 1933 wentworth moore taxidermist of the museum disappeared around the middle of the preceding month on february 18 of the same year dr william minot who superintended a dissection connected with the case was stabbed in the back dying the following daythe real beginning of the horror i suppose was in 1879long before my term as curatorwhen the museum acquired that ghastly inexplicable mummy from the orient shipping company its very discovery was monstrous and menacing for it came from a crypt of unknown origin and fabulous antiquity on a bit of land suddenly upheaved from the pacifics flooron may 11 1878 capt charles weatherbee of the freightereridanusbound from wellington new zealand to valparaiso chile had sighted a new island unmarked on any chart and evidently of volcanic origin it projected quite boldly out of the sea in the form of a truncated cone a landingparty under capt weatherbee noted evidences of long submersion on the rugged slopes which they climbed while at the summit there were signs of recent destruction as by an earthquake among the scattered rubble were massive stones of manifestly artificial shaping and a little examination disclosed the presence of some of that prehistoric cyclopean masonry found on certain pacific islands and forming a perpetual archaeological puzzlefinally the sailors entered a massive stone cryptjudged to have been part of a much larger edifice and to have originally lain far undergroundin one corner of which the frightful mummy crouched after a short period of virtual panic caused partly by certain carvings on the walls the men were induced to move the mummy to the ship though it was only with fear and loathing that they touched it close to the body as if once thrust into its clothes was a cylinder of an unknown metal containing a roll of thin bluishwhite membrane of equally unknown nature inscribed with peculiar characters in a greyish indeterminable pigment in the centre of the vast stone floor was a suggestion of a trapdoor but the party lacked apparatus sufficiently powerful to move itthe cabot museum then newly established saw the meagre reports of the discovery and at once took steps to acquire the mummy and the cylinder curator pickman made a personal trip to valparaiso and outfitted a schooner to search for the crypt where the thing had been found though meeting with failure in this matter at the recorded position of the island nothing but the seas unbroken expanse could be discerned and the seekers realised that the same seismic forces which had suddenly thrust the island up had carried it down again to the watery darkness where it had brooded for untold aeons the secret of that immovable trapdoor would never be solved the mummy and the cylinder however remainedand the former was placed on exhibition early in november 1879 in the museums hall of mummiesthe cabot museum of archaeology which specialises in such remnants of ancient and unknown civilisations as do not fall within the domain of art is a small and scarcely famous institution though one of high standing in scientific circles it stands in the heart of bostons exclusive beacon hill districtin mt vernon street near joyhoused in a former private mansion with an added wing in the rear and was a source of pride to its austere neighbours until the recent terrible events brought it an undesirable notorietythe hall of mummies on the western side of the original mansion which was designed by bulfinch and erected in 1819 on the second floor is justly esteemed by historians and anthropologists as harbouring the greatest collection of its kind in america here may be found typical examples of egyptian embalming from the earliest sakkarah specimens to the last coptic attempts of the eighth century mummies of other cultures including the prehistoric indian specimens recently found in the aleutian islands agonised pompeian figures moulded in plaster from tragic hollows in the ruinchoking ashes naturally mummified bodies from mines and other excavations in all parts of the earthsome surprised by their terrible entombment in the grotesque postures caused by their last tearing deaththroeseverything in short which any collection of the sort could well be expected to contain in 1879 of course it was much less ample than it is now yet even then it was remarkable but that shocking thing from the primal cyclopean crypt on an ephemeral seaspawned island was always its chief attraction and most impenetrable mysterythe mummy was that of a mediumsized man of unknown race and was cast in a peculiar crouching posture the face half shielded by clawlike hands had its under jaw thrust far forward while the shrivelled features bore an expression of fright so hideous that few spectators could view them unmoved the eyes were closed with lids clamped down tightly over eyeballs apparently bulging and prominent bits of hair and beard remained and the colour of the whole was a sort of dull neutral grey in texture the thing was half leathery and half stony forming an insoluble enigma to those experts who sought to ascertain how it was embalmed in places bits of its substance were eaten away by time and decay rags of some peculiar fabric with suggestions of unknown designs still clung to the objectjust what made it so infinitely horrible and repulsive one could hardly say for one thing there was a subtle indefinable sense of limitless antiquity and utter alienage which affected one like a view from the brink of a monstrous abyss of unplumbed blacknessbut mostly it was the expression of crazed fear on the puckered prognathous halfshielded face such a symbol of infinite inhuman cosmic fright could not help communicating the emotion to the beholder amidst a disquieting cloud of mystery and vain conjectureamong the discriminating few who frequented the cabot museum this relic of an elder forgotten world soon acquired an unholy fame though the institutions seclusion and quiet policy prevented it from becoming a popular sensation of the cardiff giant sort in the last century the art of vulgar ballyhoo had not invaded the field of scholarship to the extent it has now succeeded in doing naturally savants of various kinds tried their best to classify the frightful object though always without success theories of a bygone pacific civilisation of which the easter island images and the megalithic masonry of ponape and nanmatol are conceivable vestiges were freely circulated among students and learned journals carried varied and often conflicting speculations on a possible former continent whose peaks survive as the myriad islands of melanesia and polynesia the diversity in dates assigned to the hypothetical vanished cultureor continentwas at once bewildering and amusing yet some surprisingly relevant allusions were found in certain myths of tahiti and other islandsmeanwhile the strange cylinder and its baffling scroll of unknown hieroglyphs carefully preserved in the museum library received their due share of attention no question could exist as to their association with the mummy hence all realised that in the unravelling of their mystery the mystery of the shrivelled horror would in all probability be unravelled as well the cylinder about four inches long by seveneighths of an inch in diameter was of a queerly iridescent metal utterly defying chemical analysis and seemingly impervious to all reagents it was tightly fitted with a cap of the same substance and bore engraved figurings of an evidently decorative and possibly symbolic natureconventional designs which seemed to follow a peculiarly alien paradoxical and doubtfully describable system of geometrynot less mysterious was the scroll it containeda neat roll of some thin bluishwhite unanalysable membrane coiled round a slim rod of metal like that of the cylinder and unwinding to a length of some two feet the large bold hieroglyphs extending in a narrow line down the centre of the scroll and penned or painted with a grey pigment defying analysis resembled nothing known to linguists and palaeographers and could not be deciphered despite the transmission of photographic copies to every living expert in the given fieldit is true that a few scholars unusually versed in the literature of occultism and magic found vague resemblances between some of the hieroglyphs and certain primal symbols described or cited in two or three very ancient obscure and esoteric texts such as thebook of eibonreputed to descend from forgotten hyperborea the pnakotic fragments alleged to be prehuman and the monstrous and forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred none of these resemblances however was beyond dispute and because of the prevailing low estimation of occult studies no effort was made to circulate copies of the hieroglyphs among mystical specialists had such circulation occurred at this early date the later history of the case might have been very different indeed a glance at the hieroglyphs by any reader of von junzts horriblenameless cultswould have established a linkage of unmistakable significance at this period however the readers of that monstrous blasphemy were exceedingly few copies having been incredibly scarce in the interval between the suppression of the original dsseldorf edition 1839 and of the bridewell translation 1845 and the publication of the expurgated reprint by the golden goblin press in 1909 practically speaking no occultist or student of the primal pasts esoteric lore had his attention called to the strange scroll until the recent outburst of sensational journalism which precipitated the horrible climaxiithus matters glided along for a halfcentury following the installation of the frightful mummy at the museum the gruesome object had a local celebrity among cultivated bostonians but no more than that while the very existence of the cylinder and scrollafter a decade of futile researchwas virtually forgotten so quiet and conservative was the cabot museum that no reporter or feature writer ever thought of invading its uneventful precincts for rabbletickling materialthe invasion of ballyhoo commenced in the spring of 1931 when a purchase of somewhat spectacular naturethat of the strange objects and inexplicably preserved bodies found in

knowledgeby june the fame of the mummy and scroll had leaked far beyond boston and the museum had inquiries and requests for photographs from occultists and students of arcana all over the world this was not altogether pleasing to our staff since we are a scientific institution without sympathy for fantastic dreamers yet we answered all questions with civility one result of these catechisms was a highly learned article inthe occult reviewby the famous new orleans mystic etiennelaurent de marigny in which was asserted the complete identity of some of the odd geometrical designs on the iridescent cylinder and of several of the hieroglyphs on the membraneous scroll with certain ideographs of horrible significance transcribed from primal monoliths or from the secret rituals of hidden bands of esoteric students and devotees reproduced in the hellish and suppressedblack bookornameless cultsof von junztde marigny recalled the frightful death of von junzt in 1840 a year after the publication of his terrible volume at dsseldorf and commented on his bloodcurdling and partly suspected sources of information above all he emphasised the enormous relevance of the tales with which von junzt linked most of the monstrous ideographs he had reproduced that these tales in which a cylinder and scroll were expressly mentioned held a remarkable suggestion of relationship to the things at the museum no one could deny yet they were of such breathtaking extravaganceinvolving such unbelievable sweeps of time and such fantastic anomalies of a forgotten elder worldthat one could much more easily admire than believe themadmire them the public certainly did for copying in the press was universal illustrated articles sprang up everywhere telling or purporting to tell the legends in

the misty fabulous dawnyears that to which legend has given the name of mu and which old tablets in the primal naacal tongue speak of as flourishing 200000 years ago when europe harboured only hybrid entities and lost hyperborea knew the nameless worship of black amorphous tsathogguathere was mention of a kingdom or province called knaa in a very ancient land where the first human people had found monstrous ruins left by those who had dwelt there beforevague waves of unknown entities which had filtered down from the stars and lived out their aeons on a forgotten nascent world knaa was a sacred place since from its midst the bleak basalt cliffs of mount yaddithgho soared starkly into the sky topped by a gigantic fortress of cyclopean stone infinitely older than mankind and built by the alien spawn of the dark planet yuggoth which had colonised the earth before the birth of terrestrial lifethe spawn of yuggoth had perished aeons before but had left behind them one monstrous and terrible living thing which could never dietheir hellish god or patron daemon ghatanothoa which lowered and brooded eternally though unseen in the crypts beneath that fortress on yaddithgho no human creature had ever climbed yaddithgho or seen that blasphemous fortress except as a distant and geometrically abnormal outline against the sky yet most agreed that ghatanothoa was still there wallowing and burrowing in unsuspected abysses beneath the megalithic walls there were always those who believed that sacrifices must be made to ghatanothoa lest it crawl out of its hidden abysses and waddle horribly through the world of men as it had once waddled through the primal world of the yuggothspawnpeople said that if no victims were offered ghatanothoa would ooze up to the light of day and lumber down the basalt cliffs of yaddithgho bringing doom to all it might encounter for no living thing could behold ghatanothoa or even a perfect graven image of ghatanothoa however small without suffering a change more horrible than death itself sight of the god or its image as all the legends of the yuggothspawn agreed meant paralysis and petrifaction of a singularly shocking sort in which the victim was turned to stone and leather on the outside while the brain within remained perpetually alivehorribly fixed and prisoned through the ages and maddeningly conscious of the passage of interminable epochs of helpless inaction till chance and time might complete the decay of the petrified shell and leave it exposed to die most brains of course would go mad long before this aeondeferred release could arrive no human eyes it was said had ever glimpsed ghatanothoa though the danger was as great now as it had been for the yuggothspawnand so there was a cult in knaa which worshipped ghatanothoa and each year sacrificed to it twelve young warriors and twelve young maidens these victims were offered up on flaming altars in the marble temple near the mountains base for none dared climb yaddithghos basalt cliffs or draw near to the cyclopean prehuman stronghold on its crest vast was the power of the priests of ghatanothoa since upon them alone depended the preservation of knaa and of all the land of mu from the petrifying emergence of ghatanothoa out of its unknown burrowsthere were in the land an hundred priests of the dark god under imashmo the highpriest who walked before king thabon at the nathfeast and stood proudly whilst the king knelt at the dhoric shrine each priest had a marble house a chest of gold two hundred slaves and an hundred concubines besides immunity from civil law and the power of life and death over all in knaa save the priests of the king yet in spite of these defenders there was ever a fear in the land lest ghatanothoa slither up from the depths and lurch viciously down the mountain to bring horror and petrification to mankind in the latter years the priests forbade men even to guess or imagine what its frightful aspect might beit was in the year of the red moon estimated as b c 173148 by von junzt that a human being first dared to breathe defiance against ghatanothoa and its nameless menace this bold heretic was tyog highpriest of shubniggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the goat with a thousand young tyog had thought long on the powers of the various gods and had had strange dreams and revelations touching the life of this and earlier worlds in the end he felt sure that the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods and believed that shubniggurath nug and yeb as well as yig the serpentgod were ready to take sides with man against the tyranny and presumption of ghatanothoainspired by the mother goddess tyog wrote down a strange formula in the hieratic naacal of his order which he believed would keep the possessor immune from the dark gods petrifying power with this protection he reflected it might be possible for a bold man to climb the dreaded basalt cliffs andfirst of all human beingsenter the cyclopean fortress beneath which ghatanothoa reputedly brooded face to face with the god and with the power of shubniggurath and her sons on his side tyog believed that he might be able to bring it to terms and at last deliver mankind from its brooding menace with humanity freed through his efforts there would be no limits to the honours he might claim all the honours of the priests of ghatanothoa would perforce be transferred to him and even kingship or godhood might conceivably be within his reachso tyog wrote his protective formula on a scroll ofpthagonmembrane according to von junzt the inner skin of the extinct yakithlizard and enclosed it in a carven cylinder oflaghmetalthe metal brought by the elder ones from yuggoth and found in no mine of earth this charm carried in his robe would make him proof against the menace of ghatanothoait would even restore the dark gods petrified victims if that monstrous entity should ever emerge and begin its devastations thus he proposed to go up the shunned and manuntrodden mountain invade the alienangled citadel of cyclopean stone and confront the shocking devilentity in its lair of what would follow he could not even guess but the hope of being mankinds saviour lent strength to his willhe had however reckoned without the jealousy and selfinterest of ghatanothoas pampered priests no sooner did they hear of his plan thanfearful for their prestige and privilege in case the daemongod should be dethronedthey set up a frantic clamour against the socalled sacrilege crying that no man might prevail against ghatanothoa and that any effort to seek it out would merely provoke it to a hellish onslaught against mankind which no spell or priestcraft could hope to avert with those cries they hoped to turn the public mind against tyog yet such was the peoples yearning for freedom from ghatanothoa and such their confidence in the skill and zeal of tyog that all the protestations came to naught even the king usually a puppet of the priests refused to forbid tyogs daring pilgrimageit was then that the priests of ghatanothoa did by stealth what they could not do openly one night imashmo the highpriest stole to tyog in his temple chamber and took from his sleeping form the metal cylinder silently drawing out the potent scroll and putting in its place another scroll of great similitude yet varied enough to have no power against any god or daemon when the cylinder was slipped back into the sleepers cloak imashmo was content for he knew tyog was little likely to study that cylinders contents again thinking himself protected by the true scroll the heretic would march up the forbidden mountain and into the evil presenceand ghatanothoa unchecked by any magic would take care of the restit would no longer be needful for ghatanothoas priests to preach against the defiance let tyog go his way and meet his doom and secretly the priests would always cherish the stolen scrollthe true and potent charmhanding it down from one highpriest to another for use in any dim future when it might be needful to contravene the devilgods will so the rest of the night imashmo slept in great peace with the true scroll in a new cylinder fashioned for its harbourageit was dawn on the day of the skyflames nomenclature undefined by von junzt that tyog amidst the prayers and chanting of the people and with king thabons blessing on his head started up the dreaded mountain with a staff of tlathwood in his right hand within his robe was the cylinder holding what he thought to be the true charmfor he had indeed failed to find out the imposture nor did he see any irony in the prayers which imashmo and the other priests of ghatanothoa intoned for his safety and successall that morning the people stood and watched as tyogs dwindling form struggled up the shunned basalt slope hitherto alien to mens footsteps and many stayed watching long after he had vanished where a perilous ledge led round to the mountains hidden side that night a few sensitive dreamers thought they heard a faint tremor convulsing the hated peak though most ridiculed them for the statement next day vast crowds watched the mountain and prayed and wondered how soon tyog would return and so the next day and the next for weeks they hoped and waited and then they wept nor did anyone ever see tyog who would have saved mankind from fears againthereafter men shuddered at tyogs presumption and tried not to think of the punishment his impiety had met and the priests of ghatanothoa smiled to those who might resent the gods will or challenge its right to the sacrifices in later years the ruse of imashmo became known to the people yet the knowledge availed not to change the general feeling that ghatanothoa were better left alone none ever dared to defy it again and so the ages rolled on and king succeeded king and highpriest succeeded highpriest and nations rose and decayed and lands rose above the sea and returned into the sea and with many millennia decay fell upon knaatill at last on a hideous day of storm and thunder terrific rumbling and mountainhigh waves all the land of mu sank into the sea foreveryet down the later aeons thin streams of ancient secrets trickled in distant lands there met together greyfaced fugitives who had survived the seafiends rage and strange skies drank the smoke of altars reared to vanished gods and daemons though none knew to what bottomless deep the sacred peak and cyclopean fortress of dreaded ghatanothoa had sunk there were still those who mumbled its name and offered to it nameless sacrifices lest it bubble up through leagues of ocean and shamble among men spreading horror and petrifactionaround the scattered priests grew the rudiments of a dark and secret cultsecret because the people of the new lands had other gods and devils and thought only evil of elder and alien onesand within that cult many hideous things were done and many strange objects cherished it was whispered that a certain line of elusive priests still harboured the true charm against ghatanothoa which imashmo stole from the sleeping tyog though none remained who could read or understand the cryptic syllables or who could even guess in what part of the world the lost knaa the dreaded peak of yaddithgho and the titan fortress of the devilgod had lainthough it flourished chiefly in those pacific regions around which mu itself had once stretched there were rumours of the hidden and detested cult of ghatanothoa in illfated atlantis and on the abhorred plateau of leng von junzt implied its presence in the fabled subterrene kingdom of knyan and gave clear evidence that it had penetrated egypt chaldaea persia china the forgotten semite empires of africa and mexico and peru in the new world that it had a strong connexion with the witchcraft movement in europe against which the bulls of popes were vainly directed he more than strongly hinted the west however was never favourable to its growth and public indignationaroused by glimpses of hideous rites and nameless sacrificeswholly stamped out many of its branches in the end it became a hunted doubly furtive underground affairyet never could its nucleus be quite exterminated it always survived somehow chiefly in the far east and on the pacific islands where its teachings became merged into the esoteric lore of the polynesianareoivon junzt gave subtle and disquieting hints of actual contact with the cult so that as i read i shuddered at what was rumoured about his death he spoke of the growth of certain ideas regarding the appearance of the devilgoda creature which no human being unless it were the toodaring tyog who had never returned had ever seenand contrasted this habit of speculation with the taboo prevailing in ancient mu against any attempt to imagine what the horror looked like there was a peculiar fearfulness about the devotees awed and fascinated whispers on this subjectwhispers heavy with morbid curiosity concerning the precise nature of what tyog might have confronted in that frightful prehuman edifice on the dreaded and nowsunken mountains before the end if it was an end finally cameand i felt oddly disturbed by the german scholars oblique and insidious references to this topicscarcely less disturbing were von junzts conjectures on the whereabouts of the stolen scroll of cantrips against ghatanothoa and on the ultimate uses to which this scroll might be put despite all my assurance that the whole matter was purely mythical i could not help shivering at the notion of a latterday emergence of the monstrous god and at the picture of an humanity turned suddenly to a race of abnormal statues each encasing a living brain doomed to inert and helpless consciousness for untold aeons of futurity the old dsseldorf savant had a poisonous way of suggesting more than he stated and i could understand why his damnable book was suppressed in so many countries as blasphemous dangerous and uncleani writhed with repulsion yet the thing exerted an unholy fascination and i could not lay it down till i had finished it the alleged reproductions of designs and ideographs from mu were marvellously and startlingly like the markings on the strange cylinder and the characters on the scroll and the whole account teemed with details having vague irritating suggestions of resemblance to things connected with the hideous mummy the cylinder and scrollthe pacific settingthe persistent notion of old capt weatherbee that the cyclopean crypt where the mummy was found had once lain under a vast building somehow i was vaguely glad that the volcanic island had sunk before that massive suggestion of a trapdoor could be openedivwhat i read in theblack bookformed a fiendishly apt preparation for the news items and closer events which began to force themselves upon me in the spring of 1932 i can scarcely recall just when the increasingly frequent reports of police action against the odd and fantastical religious cults in the orient and elsewhere commenced to impress me but by may or june i realised that there was all over the world a surprising and unwonted burst of activity on the part of bizarre furtive and esoteric mystical organisations ordinarily quiescent and seldom heard fromit is not likely that i would have connected these reports with either the hints of von junzt or the popular furore over the mummy and cylinder in the museum but for certain significant syllables and persistent resemblancessensationally dwelt upon by the pressin the rites and speeches of the various secret celebrants brought to public attention as it was i could not help remarking with disquiet the frequent recurrence of a namein various corrupt formswhich seemed to constitute a focal point of all the cult worship and which was obviously regarded with a singular mixture of reverence and terror some of the forms quoted were gtanta tanotah thantha gatan and ktantahand it did not require the suggestions of my now numerous occultist correspondents to make me see in these variants a hideous and suggestive kinship to the monstrous name rendered by von junzt as ghatanothoathere were other disquieting features too again and again the reports cited vague awestruck references to a true scrollsomething on which tremendous consequences seemed to hinge and which was mentioned as being in the custody of a certain nagob whoever and whatever he might be likewise there was an insistent repetition of a name which sounded like tog tiok yog zob or yob and which my more and more excited consciousness involuntarily linked with the name of the hapless heretic tyog as given in theblack bookthis name was usually uttered in connexion with such cryptical phrases as it is none other than he he had looked upon its face he knows all though he can neither see nor feel he has brought the memory down through the aeons the true scroll will release him nagob has the true scroll he can tell where to find itsomething very queer was undoubtedly in the air and i did not wonder when my occultist correspondents as well as the sensational sunday papers began to connect the new abnormal stirrings with the legends of mu on the one hand and with the frightful mummys recent exploitation on the other hand the widespread articles in the first wave of press publicity with their insistent linkage of the mummy cylinder and scroll with the tale in theblack bookand their crazily fantastic speculations about the whole matter might very well have roused the latent fanaticism in hundreds of those furtive groups of exotic devotees with which our complex world abounds nor did the papers cease adding fuel to the flamesfor the stories on the cultstirrings were even wilder than the earlier series of yarnsas the summer drew on attendants noticed a curious new element among the throngs of visitors whichafter a lull following the first burst of publicitywere again drawn to the museum by the second furore more and more frequently there were persons of strange and exotic aspectswarthy asiatics longhaired nondescripts and bearded brown men who seemed unused to european clotheswho would invariably inquire for the hall of mummies and would subsequently be found staring at the hideous pacific specimen in a veritable ecstasy of fascination some quiet sinister undercurrent in this flood of eccentric foreigners seemed to impress all the guards and i myself was far from undisturbed i could not help thinking of the prevailing cultstirrings among just such exotics as theseand the connexion of those stirrings with myths all too close to the frightful mummy and its cylinder scrollat times i was half tempted to withdraw the mummy from exhibitionespecially when an attendant told me that he had several times glimpsed strangers making odd obeisances before it and had overheard singsong mutterings which sounded like chants or rituals addressed to it at hours when the visiting throngs were somewhat thinned one of the guards acquired a queer nervous hallucination about the petrified horror in the lone glass case alleging that he could see from day to day certain vague subtle and infinitely slight changes in the frantic flexion of the bony claws and in the fearcrazed expression of the leathery face he could not get rid of the loathsome idea that those horrible bulging eyes were about to pop suddenly openit was early in september when the curious crowds had lessened and the hall of mummies was sometimes vacant that the attempt to get at the mummy by cutting the glass of its case was made the culprit a swarthy polynesian was spied in time by a guard and was overpowered before any damage occurred upon investigation the fellow turned out to be an hawaiian notorious for his activity in certain underground religious cults and having a considerable police record in connexion with abnormal and inhuman rites and sacrifices some of the papers found in his room were highly puzzling and disturbing including many sheets covered with hieroglyphs closely resembling those on the scroll at the museum and in theblack bookof von junzt but regarding these things he could not be prevailed upon to speakscarcely a week after this incident another attempt to get at the mummythis time by tampering with the lock of his caseresulted in a second arrest the offender a cingalese had as long and unsavoury a record of loathsome cult activities as the hawaiian had possessed and displayed a kindred unwillingness to talk to the police what made this case doubly and darkly interesting was that a guard had noticed this man several times before and had heard him addressing to the mummy a peculiar chant containing unmistakable repetitions of the word tyog as a result of this affair i doubled the guards in the hall of mummies and ordered them never to leave the now notorious specimen out of sight even for a momentas may well be imagined the press made much of these two incidents reviewing its talk of primal and fabulous mu and claiming boldly that the hideous mummy was none other than the daring heretic tyog petrified by something he had seen in the prehuman citadel he had invaded and preserved intact through 175000 years of our planets turbulent history that the strange devotees represented cults descended from mu and that they were worshipping the mummyor perhaps even seeking to awaken it to life by spells and incantationswas emphasised and reiterated in the most sensational fashionwriters exploited the insistence of the old legends that thebrainof ghatanothoas petrified victims remained conscious and unaffecteda point which served as a basis for the wildest and most improbable speculations the mention of a true scroll also received due attentionit being the prevailing popular theory that tyogs stolen charm against ghatanothoa was somewhere in existence and that cultmembers were trying to bring it into contact with tyog himself for some purpose of their own one result of this exploitation was that a third wave of gaping visitors began flooding the museum and staring at the hellish mummy which served as a nucleus for the whole strange and disturbing affairit was among this wave of spectatorsmany of whom made repeated visitsthat talk of the mummys vaguely changing aspect first began to be widespread i supposedespite the disturbing notion of the nervous guard some months beforethat the museums personnel was too well used to the constant sight of odd shapes to pay close attention to details in any case it was the excited whispers of visitors which at length aroused the guards to the subtle mutation which was apparently in progress almost simultaneously the press got hold of itwith blatant results which can well be imaginednaturally i gave the matter my most careful observation and by the middle of october decided that a definite disintegration of the mummy was under way through some chemical or physical influence in the air the halfstony halfleathery fibres seemed to be gradually relaxing causing distinct variations in the angles of the limbs and in certain details of the feartwisted facial expression after a halfcentury of perfect preservation this was a highly disconcerting development and i had the museums taxidermist dr moore go carefully over the gruesome object several times he reported a general relaxation and softening and gave the thing two or three astringent sprayings but did not dare to attempt anything drastic lest there be a sudden crumbling and accelerated decaythe effect of all this upon the gaping crowds was curious heretofore each new sensation sprung by the press had brought fresh waves of staring and whispering visitors but nowthough the papers blathered endlessly about the mummys changesthe public seemed to have acquired a definite sense of fear which outranked even its morbid curiosity people seemed to feel that a sinister aura hovered over the museum and from a high peak the attendance fell to a level distinctly below normal this lessened attendance gave added prominence to the stream of freakish foreigners who continued to infest the place and whose numbers seemed in no way diminishedon november 18th a peruvian of indian blood suffered a strange hysterical or epileptic seizure in front of the mummy afterward shrieking from his hospital cot it tried to open its eyestyog tried to open his eyes and stare at me i was by this time on the point of removing the object from exhibition but permitted myself to be overruled at a meeting of our very conservative directors however i could see that the museum was beginning to acquire an unholy reputation in its austere and quiet neighbourhood after this incident i gave instructions that no one be allowed to pause before the monstrous pacific relic for more than a few minutes at a timeit was on november 24th after the museums five oclock closing that one of the guards noticed a minute opening of the mummys eyes the phenomenon was very slightnothing but a thin crescent of cornea being visible in either eyebut it was none the less of the highest interest dr moore having been summoned hastily was about to study the exposed bits of eyeball with a magnifier when his handling of the mummy caused the leathery lids to fall tightly shut again all gentle efforts to open them failed and the taxidermist did not dare to apply drastic measures when he notified me of all this by telephone i felt a sense of mounting dread hard to reconcile with the apparently simple event concerned for a moment i could share the popular impression that some evil amorphous blight from unplumbed deeps of time and space hung murkily and menacingly over the museumtwo nights later a sullen filipino was trying to secrete himself in the museum at closing time arrested and taken to the station he refused even to give his name and was detained as a suspicious person meanwhile the strict surveillance of the mummy seemed to discourage the odd hordes of foreigners from haunting it at least the number of exotic visitors distinctly fell off after the enforcement of the move along orderit was during the early morning hours of thursday december 1st that a terrible climax developed at about one oclock horrible screams of mortal fright and agony were heard issuing from the museum and a series of frantic telephone calls from neighbours brought to the scene quickly and simultaneously a squad of police and several museum officials including myself some of the policemen surrounded the building while others with the officials cautiously entered in the main corridor we found the night watchman strangled to deatha bit of east indian hemp still knotted around his neckand realised that despite all precautions some darkly evil intruder or intruders had gained access to the place now however a tomblike silence enfolded everything and we almost feared to advance upstairs to the fateful wing where we knew the core of the trouble must lurk we felt a bit more steadied after flooding the building with light from the central switches in the corridor and finally crept reluctantly up the curving staircase and through a lofty archway to the hall of mummiesvit is from this point onward that reports of the hideous case have been censoredfor we have all agreed that no good can be accomplished by a public knowledge of those terrestrial conditions implied by the further developments i have said that we flooded the whole building with light before our ascent now beneath the beams that beat down on the glistening cases and their gruesome contents we saw outspread a mute horror whose baffling details testified to happenings utterly beyond our comprehension there were two intruderswho we afterward agreed must have hidden in the building before closing timebut they would never be executed for the watchmans murder they had already paid the penaltyone was a burmese and the other a fijiislanderboth known to the police for their share in frightful and repulsive cult activities they were dead and the more we examined them the more utterly monstrous and unnamable we felt their manner of death to be on both faces was a more wholly frantic and inhuman look of fright than even the oldest policeman had ever seen before yet in the state of the two bodies there were vast and significant differencesthe burmese lay collapsed close to the nameless mummys case from which a square of glass had been neatly cut in his right hand was a scroll of bluish membrane which i at once saw was covered with greyish hieroglyphsalmost a duplicate of the scroll in the strange cylinder in the library downstairs though later study brought out subtle differences there was no mark of violence on the body and in view of the desperate agonised expression on the twisted face we could only conclude that the man died of sheer frightit was the closely adjacent fijian though that gave us the profoundest shock one of the policemen was the first to feel of him and the cry of fright he emitted added another shudder to that neighbourhoods night of terror we ought to have known from the lethal greyness of the onceblack feartwisted face and of the bony handsone of which still clutched an electric torchthat something was hideously wrong yet every one of us was unprepared for what that officers hesitant touch disclosed even now i can think of it only with a paroxysm of dread and repulsion to be briefthe hapless invader who less than an hour before had been a sturdy living melanesian bent on unknown evils was now a rigid ashgrey figure of stony leathery petrification in every respect identical with the crouching aeonold blasphemy in the violated glass caseyet that was not the worst crowning all other horrors and indeed seizing our shocked attention before we turned to the bodies on the floor was the state of the frightful mummy no longer could its changes be called vague and subtle for it had now made radical shifts of posture it had sagged and slumped with a curious loss of rigidity its bony claws had sunk until they no longer even partly covered its leathery fearcrazed face andgod help usits hellish bulging eyes had popped wide open and seemed to be staring directly at the two intruders who had died of fright or worsethat ghastly deadfish stare was hideously mesmerising and it haunted us all the time we were examining the bodies of the invaders its effect on our nerves was damnably queer for we somehow felt a curious rigidity creeping over us and hampering our simplest motionsa rigidity which later vanished very oddly when we passed the hieroglyphed scroll around for inspection every now and then i felt my gaze drawn irresistibly toward those horrible bulging eyes in the case and when i returned to study them after viewing the bodies i thought i detected something very singular about the glassy surface of the dark and marvellously wellpreserved pupils the more i looked the more fascinated i became and at last i went down to the officedespite that strange stiffness in my limbsand brought up a strong multiple magnifying glass with this i commenced a very close and careful survey of the fishy pupils while the others crowded expectantly aroundi had always been rather sceptical of the theory that scenes and objects become photographed on the retina of the eye in cases of death or coma yet no sooner did i look through the lens than i realised the presence of some sort of image other than the rooms reflection in the glassy bulging optics of this nameless spawn of the aeons certainly there was a dimly outlined scene on the ageold retinal surface and i could not doubt that it formed the last thing on which those eyes had looked in lifecountless millennia ago it seemed to be steadily fading and i fumbled with the magnifier in order to shift another lens into place yet it must have been accurate and clearcut even if infinitesimally small whenin response to some evil spell or act connected with their visitit had confronted those intruders who were frightened to death with the extra lens i could make out many details formerly invisible and the awed group around me hung on the flood of words with which i tried to tell what i sawfor here in the year 1932 a man in the city of boston was looking on something which belonged to an unknown and utterly alien worlda world that vanished from existence and normal memory aeons ago there was a vast rooma chamber of cyclopean masonryand i seemed to be viewing it from one of its corners on the walls were carvings so hideous that even in this imperfect image their stark blasphemousness and bestiality sickened me i could not believe that the carvers of these things were human or that they had ever seen human beings when they shaped the frightful outlines which leered at the beholder in the centre of the chamber was a colossal trapdoor of stone pushed upward to permit the emergence of some object from below the object should have been clearly visibleindeed must have been when the eyes first opened before the fearstricken intrudersthough under my lenses it was merely a monstrous bluras it happened i was studying the right eye only when i brought the extra magnification into play a moment later i wished fervently that my search had ended there as it was however the zeal of discovery and revelation was upon me and i shifted my powerful lenses to the mummys left eye in the hope of finding the image less faded on that retina my hands trembling with excitement and unnaturally stiff from some obscure influence were slow in bringing the magnifier into focus but a moment later i realised that the image was less faded than in the other eye i saw in a morbid flash of halfdistinctness the insufferable thing which was welling up through the prodigious trapdoor in that cyclopean immemorially archaic crypt of a lost worldand fell fainting with an inarticulate shriek of which i am not even ashamedby the time i revived there was no distinct image of anything in either eye of the monstrous mummy sergeant keefe of the police looked with my glass for i could not bring myself to face that abnormal entity again and i thanked all the powers of the cosmos that i had not looked earlier than i did it took all my resolution and a great deal of solicitation to make me relate what i had glimpsed in the hideous moment of revelation indeed i could not speak till we had all adjourned to the office below out of sight of that daemoniac thing which could not be for i had begun to harbour the most terrible and fantastic notions about the mummy and its glassy bulging eyesthat it had a kind of hellish consciousness seeing all that occurred before it and trying vainly to communicate some frightful message from the gulfs of time that meant madnessbut at last i thought i might be better off if i told what i had half seenafter all it was not a long thing to tell oozing and surging up out of that yawning trapdoor in the cyclopean crypt i had glimpsed such an unbelievable behemothic monstrosity that i could not doubt the power of its original to kill with its mere sight even now i cannot begin to suggest it with any words at my command i might call it gigantictentacledproboscidianoctopuseyedsemiamorphousplasticpartly squamous and partly rugoseugh but nothing i could say could even adumbrate the loathsome unholy nonhuman extragalactic horror and hatefulness and unutterable evil of that forbidden spawn of black chaos and illimitable night as i write these words the associated mental image causes me to lean back faint and nauseated as i told of the sight to the men around me in the office i had to fight to preserve the consciousness i had regainednor were my hearers much less moved not a man spoke above a whisper for a full quarterhour and there were awed halffurtive references to the frightful lore in theblack bookto the recent newspaper tales of cultstirrings and to the sinister events in the museum ghatanothoa even its smallest

where to find it only the healing greyness of the dawn brought us back to sanity a sanity which made of that glimpse of mine a closed topicsomething not to be explained or thought of againwe gave out only partial reports to the press and later on coperated with the papers in making other suppressions for example when the autopsy shewed the brain and several other internal organs of the petrified fijian to be fresh and unpetrified though hermetically sealed by the petrification of the exterior fleshan anomaly about which physicians are still guardedly and bewilderedly debatingwe did not wish a furore to be started we knew too well what the yellow journals remembering what was said of the intactbrained and stillconscious state of ghatanothoas stonyleathery victims would make of this detailas matters stood they pointed out that the man who had held the hieroglyphed scrolland who had evidently thrust it at the mummy through the opening in the casewas not petrified while the man who hadnotheld it was when they demanded that we make certain experimentsapplying the scroll both to the stonyleathery body of the fijian and to the mummy itselfwe indignantly refused to abet such superstitious notions of course the mummy was withdrawn from public view and transferred to the museum laboratory awaiting a really scientific examination before some suitable medical authority remembering past events we kept it under a strict guard but even so an attempt was made to enter the museum at 225 am on december 5th prompt working of the burglar alarm frustrated the design though unfortunately the criminal or criminals escapedthat no hint of anything further ever reached the public i am profoundly thankful i wish devoutly that there were nothing more to tell there will of course be leaks and if anything happens to me i do not know what my executors will do with this manuscript but at least the case will not be painfully fresh in the multitudes memory when the revelation comes besides no one will believe the facts when they are finally told that is the curious thing about the multitude when their yellow press makes hints they are ready to swallow anything but when a stupendous and abnormal revelation is actually made they laugh it aside as a lie for the sake of general sanity it is probably better soi have said that a scientific examination of the frightful mummy was planned this took place on december 8th exactly a week after the hideous culmination of events and was conducted by the eminent dr william minot in conjunction with wentworth moore scd taxidermist of the museum dr minot had witnessed the autopsy of the oddly petrified fijian the week before there were also present messrs lawrence cabot and dudley saltonstall of the museums trustees drs mason wells and carver of the museum staff two representatives of the press and myself during the week the condition of the hideous specimen had not visibly changed though some relaxation of its fibres caused the position of the glassy open eyes to shift slightly from time to time all of the staff dreaded to look at the thingfor its suggestion of quiet conscious watching had become intolerableand it was only with an effort that i could bring myself to attend the examinationdr minot arrived shortly after 100 pm and within a few minutes began his survey of the mummy considerable disintegration took place under his hands and in view of thisand of what we told him concerning the gradual relaxation of the specimen since the first of octoberhe decided that a thorough dissection ought to be made before the substance was further impaired the proper instruments being present in the laboratory equipment he began at once exclaiming aloud at the odd fibrous nature of the grey mummified substancebut his exclamation was still louder when he made the first deep incision for out of that cut there slowly trickled a thick crimson stream whose naturedespite the infinite ages dividing this hellish mummys lifetime from the presentwas utterly unmistakable a few more deft strokes revealed various organs in astonishing degrees of nonpetrified preservationall indeed being intact except where injuries to the petrified exterior had brought about malformation or destruction the resemblance of this condition to that found in the frightkilled fijiislander was so strong that the eminent physician gasped in bewilderment the perfection of those ghastly bulging eyes was uncanny and their exact state with respect to petrification was very difficult to determineat 330 pm the braincase was openedand ten minutes later our stunned group took an oath of secrecy which only such guarded documents as this manuscript will ever modify even the two reporters were glad to confirm the silencefor the opening had revealed a pulsing living brain,1
that night the baron dreamt of many a woeand all his warriorguests with shade and formof witch and demon and large coffinwormwere long benightmaredkeatsunhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque gigantic and vineencumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft such a lot the gods gave to meto me the dazed the disappointed the barren the broken and yet i am strangely content and cling desperately to those sere memories when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond tothe otheri know not where i was born save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows the stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp and there was an accursed smell everywhere as of the piledup corpses of dead generations it was never light so that i used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief nor was there any sun outdoors since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower there was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a wellnigh impossible climb up the sheer wall stone by stonei must have lived years in this place but i cannot measure the time beings must have cared for my needs yet i cannot recall any person except myself or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself yet distorted shrivelled and decaying like the castle to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations i fantastically associated these things with everyday events and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which i found in many of the mouldy books from such books i learned all that i know no teacher urged or guided me and i do not recall hearing any human voice in all those yearsnot even my own for although i had read of speech i had never thought to try to speak aloud my aspect was a matter equally unthought of for there were no mirrors in the castle and i merely regarded myself by instinct as akin to the youthful figures i saw drawn and painted in the books i felt conscious of youth because i remembered so littleoutside across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees i would often lie and dream for hours about what i read in the books and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forest once i tried to escape from the forest but as i went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear so that i ran frantically back lest i lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silenceso through endless twilights i dreamed and waited though i knew not what i waited for then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that i could rest no more and i lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky and at last i resolved to scale that tower fall though i might since it were better to glimpse the sky and perish than to live without ever beholding dayin the dank twilight i climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till i reached the level where they ceased and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward ghastly and terrible was that dead stairless cylinder of rock black ruined and deserted and sinister with startled bats whose wings made no noise but more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my progress for climb as i might the darkness overhead grew no thinner and a new chill as of haunted and venerable mould assailed me i shivered as i wondered why i did not reach the light and would have looked down had i dared i fancied that night had come suddenly upon me and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure that i might peer out and above and try to judge the height i had attainedall at once after an infinity of awesome sightless crawling up that concave and desperate precipice i felt my head touch a solid thing and i knew i must have gained the roof or at least some kind of floor in the darkness i raised my free hand and tested the barrier finding it stone and immovable then came a deadly circuit of the tower clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding and i turned upward again pushing the slab or door with my head as i used both hands in my fearful ascent there was no light revealed above and as my hands went higher i knew that my climb was for the nonce ended since the slab was the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber i crawled through carefully and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place but failed in the latter attempt as i lay exhausted on the stone floor i heard the eerie echoes of its fall but hoped when necessary to pry it open againbelieving i was now at a prodigious height far above the accursed branches of the wood i dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows that i might look for the first time upon the sky and the moon and stars of which i had read but on every hand i was disappointed since all that i found were vast shelves of marble bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size more and more i reflected and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway where hung a portal of stone rough with strange chiselling trying it i found it locked but with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward as i did so there came to me the purest ecstasy i have ever known for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway was the radiant full moon which i had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions i dared not call memoriesfancying now that i had attained the very pinnacle of the castle i commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble and i felt my way more slowly in the dark it was still very dark when i reached the gratingwhich i tried carefully and found unlocked but which i did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which i had climbed then the moon came outmost daemoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely unbelievable nothing i had before undergone could compare in terror with what i now saw with the bizarre marvels that sight implied the sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying for it was merely this instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence there stretched around me on a level through the grating nothing less thanthe solid grounddecked and diversified by marble slabs and columns and overshadowed by an ancient stone church whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlighthalf unconscious i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions my mind stunned and chaotic as it was still held the frantic craving for light and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity dreaming or magic but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost i knew not who i was or what i was or what my surroundings might be though as i continued to stumble along i became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous i passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns and wandered through the open country sometimes following the visible road but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road once i swam across a swift river where crumbling mossy masonry told of a bridge long vanishedover two hours must have passed before i reached what seemed to be my goal a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park maddeningly familiar yet full of perplexing strangeness to me i saw that the moat was filled in and that some of the wellknown towers were demolished whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder but what i observed with chief interest and delight were the open windowsgorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry advancing to one of these i looked in and saw an oddly dressed company indeed making merry and speaking brightly to one another i had never seemingly heard human speech before and could guess only vaguely what was said some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up incredibly remote recollections others were utterly alieni now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room stepping as i did so from my single bright moment of hope to my blackest convulsion of despair and realisation the nightmare was quick to come for as i entered there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations i had ever conceived scarcely had i crossed the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every throat flight was universal and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions many covered their eyes with their hands and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doorsthe cries were shocking and as i stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed listening to their vanishing echoes i trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen at a casual inspection the room seemed deserted but when i moved toward one of the alcoves i thought i detected a presence therea hint of motion beyond the goldenarched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room as i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly and then with the first and last sound i ever uttereda ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious causei beheld in full frightful vividness the inconceivable indescribable and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitivesi cannot even hint what it was like for it was a compound of all that is unclean uncanny unwelcome abnormal and detestable it was the ghoulish shade of decay antiquity and desolation the putrid dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide god knows it was not of this worldor no longer of this worldyet to my horror i saw in its eatenaway and bonerevealing outlines a leering abhorrent travesty on the human shape and in its mouldy disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even morei was almost paralysed but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless voiceless monster held me my eyes bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them refused to close though they were mercifully blurred and shewed the terrible object but indistinctly after the first shock i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will the attempt however was enough to disturb my balance so that i had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling as i did so i became suddenly and agonisingly aware of thenearnessof the carrion thing whose hideous hollow breathing i half fancied i could hear nearly mad i found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward off the foetid apparition which pressed so close when in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accidentmy fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster beneath the golden archi did not shriek but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind a single and fleeting avalanche of soulannihilating memory i knew in that second all that had been i remembered beyond the frightful castle and the trees and recognised the altered edifice in which i now stood i recognised most terrible of all the unholy abomination that stood leering before me as i withdrew my sullied fingers from its ownbut in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness and that balm is nepenthe in the supreme horror of that second i forgot what had horrified me and the burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of echoing images in a dream i fled from that haunted and accursed pile and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight when i returned to the churchyard place of marble and went down the steps i found the stone trapdoor immovable but i was not sorry for i had hated the antique castle and the trees now i ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the nightwind and play by day amongst the catacombs of nephrenka in the sealed and unknown valley of hadoth by the nile i know that light is not for me save that of the moon over the rock tombs of neb nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of nitokris beneath the great pyramid yet in my new wildness and freedom i almost welcome the bitterness of alienagefor although nepenthe has calmed me i know always that i am an outsider a stranger in this century and among those who are still men this i have known ever since i stretched out my fingers to the abomination within that great gilded frame stretched out my fingers and toucheda cold and unyielding surface of polished glass,1
you neednt think im crazy eliotplenty of others have queerer prejudices than this why dont you laugh at olivers grandfather who wont ride in a motor if i dont like that damned subway its my own business and we got here more quickly anyhow in the taxi wed have had to walk up the hill from park street if wed taken the cari know im more nervous than i was when you saw me last year but you dont need to hold a clinic over it theres plenty of reason god knows and i fancy im lucky to be sane at all why the third degree you didnt use to be so inquisitivewell if you must hear it i dont know why you shouldnt maybe you ought to anyhow for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard id begun to cut the art club and keep away from pickman now that hes disappeared i go around to the club once in a while but my nerves arent what they wereno i dont know whats become of pickman and i dont like to guess you might have surmised i had some inside information when i dropped himand thats why i dont want to think where hes gone let the police find what they canit wont be much judging from the fact that they dont know yet of the old north end place he hired under the name of peters im not sure that i could find it again myselfnot that id ever try even in broad daylight yes i do know or am afraid i know why he maintained it im coming to that and i think youll understand before im through why i dont tell the police they would ask me to guide them but i couldnt go back there even if i knew the way there was something thereand now i cant use the subway or and you may as well have your laugh at this too go down into cellars any morei should think youd have known i didnt drop pickman for the same silly reasons that fussy old women like dr reid or joe minot or bosworth did morbid art doesnt shock me and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him no matter what direction his work takes boston never had a greater painter than richard upton pickman i said it at first and i say it still and i never swerved an inch either when he shewed that ghoul feeding that you remember was when minot cut himyou know it takes profound art and profound insight into nature to turn out stuff like pickmans any magazinecover hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a witches sabbath or a portrait of the devil but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true thats because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fearthe exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness i dont have to tell you why a fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap ghoststory frontispiece merely makes us laugh theres something those fellows catchbeyond lifethat theyre able to make us catch for a second dor had it sime has it angarola of chicago has it and pickman had it as no man ever had it before ori hope to heavenever will againdont ask me what it is they see you know in ordinary art theres all the difference in the world between the vital breathing things drawn from nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule well i should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in anyhow he manages to turn out results that differ from the pretenders mincepie dreams in just about the same way that the life painters results differ from the concoctions of a correspondenceschool cartoonist if i had ever seen what pickman sawbut no here lets have a drink before we get any deeper gad i wouldnt be alive if id ever seen what that manif he was a mansawyou recall that pickmans forte was faces i dont believe anybody since goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression and before goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on notre dame and mont saintmichel they believed all sorts of thingsand maybe they saw all sorts of things too for the middle ages had some curious phases i remember your asking pickman yourself once the year before you went away wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions wasnt that a nasty laugh he gave you it was partly because of that laugh that reid dropped him reid you know had just taken up comparative pathology and was full of pompous inside stuff about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom he said pickman repelled him more and more every day and almost frightened him toward the lastthat the fellows features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didnt like in a way that wasnt human he had a lot of talk about diet and said pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree i suppose you told reid if you and he had any correspondence over it that hed let pickmans paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination i know i told him that myselfthenbut keep in mind that i didnt drop pickman for anything like this on the contrary my admiration for him kept growing for that ghoul feeding was a tremendous achievement as you know the club wouldnt exhibit it and the museum of fine arts wouldnt accept it as a gift and i can add that nobody would buy it so pickman had it right in his house till he went now his father has it in salemyou know pickman comes of old salem stock and had a witch ancestor hanged in 1692i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art probably it was his work which put the idea into my head and anyhow i found him a mine of data and suggestions when i came to develop it he shewed me all the paintings and drawings he had about including some penandink sketches that would i verily believe have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them before long i was pretty nearly a devotee and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the danvers asylum my heroworship coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him made him get very confidential with me and one evening he hinted that if i were fairly closemouthed and none too squeamish he might shew me something rather unusualsomething a bit stronger than anything he had in the houseyou know he said there are things that wont do for newbury streetthings that are out of place here and that cant be conceived here anyhow its my business to catch the overtones of the soul and you wont find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land back bay isnt bostonit isnt anything yet because its had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits if there are any ghosts here theyre the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a shallow cove and i want human ghoststhe ghosts of beings highly organised enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what they sawthe place for an artist to live is the north end if any aesthete were sincere hed put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions god man dont you realise that places like that werent merelymadebut actuallygrewgeneration after generation lived and felt and died there and in days when people werent afraid to live and feel and die dont you know there was a mill on copps hill in 1632 and that half the present streets were laid out by 1650 i can shew you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it you call the salem witchcraft a delusion but ill wage my fourtimesgreatgrandmother could have told you things they hanged her on gallows hill with cotton mather looking sanctimoniously on mather damn him was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of this accursed cage of monotonyi wish someone had laid a spell on him or sucked his blood in the nighti can shew you a house he lived in and i can shew you another one he was afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk he knew things he didnt dare put into that stupidmagnaliaor that puerilewonders of the invisible worldlook here do you know the whole north end once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each others houses and the buryingground and the sea let them prosecute and persecute above groundthings went on every day that they couldnt reach and voices laughed at night that they couldnt placewhy man out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not moved since ill wager that in eight i can shew you something queer in the cellar theres hardly a month that you dont read of workmen finding brickedup arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old place as it comes downyou could see one near henchman street from the elevated last year there were witches and what their spells summoned pirates and what they brought in from the sea smugglers privateersand i tell you people knew how to live and how to enlarge the bounds of life in the old times this wasnt the only world a bold and wise man could knowfaugh and to think of today in contrast with such palepink brains that even a club of supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the feelings of a beacon street teatablethe only saving grace of the present is that its too damned stupid to question the past very closely what do maps and records and guidebooks really tell of the north end bah at a guess ill guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of prince street that arent suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them and what do those dagoes know of their meaning no thurber these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and overflowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the commonplace and yet theres not a living soul to understand or profit by them or rather theres only one living soulfor i havent been digging around in the past for nothingsee here youre interested in this sort of thing what if i told you that ive got another studio up there where i can catch the nightspirit of antique horror and paint things that i couldnt even think of in newbury street naturally i dont tell those cursed old maids at the clubwith reid damn him whispering even as it is that im a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution yes thurber i decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life so i did some exploring in places where i had reason to know terror livesive got a place that i dont believe three living nordic men besides myself have ever seen it isnt so very far from the elevated as distance goes but its centuries away as the soul goes i took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellarone of the sort i told you about the shacks almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there and id hate to tell you how little i pay for it the windows are boarded up but i like that all the better since i dont want daylight for what i do i paint in the cellar where the inspiration is thickest but ive other rooms furnished on the ground floor a sicilian owns it and ive hired it under the name of petersnow if youre game ill take you there tonight i think youd enjoy the pictures for as i said ive let myself go a bit there its no vast touri sometimes do it on foot for i dont want to attract attention with a taxi in such a place we can take the shuttle at the south station for battery street and after that the walk isnt muchwell eliot there wasnt much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight we changed to the elevated at the south station and at about twelve oclock had climbed down the steps at battery street and struck along the old waterfront past constitution wharf i didnt keep track of the cross streets and cant tell you yet which it was we turned up but i know it wasnt greenough lanewhen we did turn it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life with crumblinglooking gables broken smallpaned windows and archaic chimneys that stood out halfdisintegrated against the moonlit sky i dont believe there were three houses in sight that hadnt been standing in cotton mathers timecertainly i glimpsed at least two with an overhang and once i thought i saw a peaked roofline of the almost forgotten pregambrel type though antiquarians tell us there are none left in bostonfrom that alley which had a dim light we turned to the left into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all and in a minute made what i think was an obtuseangled bend toward the right in the dark not long after this pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian tenpanelled door that looked damnably wormeaten unlocking it he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid darkoak panellingsimple of course but thrillingly suggestive of the times of andros and phipps and the witchcraft then he took me through a door on the left lighted an oil lamp and told me to make myself at homenow eliot im what the man in the street would call fairly hardboiled but ill confess that what i saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn they were his pictures you knowthe ones he couldnt paint or even shew in newbury streetand he was right when he said he had let himself go herehave another drinki need one anyhowtheres no use in my trying to tell you what they were like because the awful the blasphemous horror and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime none of the transsaturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood the backgrounds were mostly old churchyards deep woods cliffs by the sea brick tunnels ancient panelled rooms or simple vaults of masonry copps hill burying ground which could not be many blocks away from this very house was a favourite scenethe madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foregroundfor pickmans morbid art was preminently one of daemoniac portraiture these figures were seldom completely human but often approached humanity in varying degree most of the bodies while roughly bipedal had a forward slumping and a vaguely canine cast the texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness ugh i can see them now their occupationswell dont ask me to be too precise they were usually feedingi wont say on what they were sometimes shewn in groups in cemeteries or underground passages and often appeared to be in battle over their preyor rather their treasuretrove and what damnable expressiveness pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty occasionally the things were shewn leaping through open windows at night or squatting on the chests of sleepers worrying at their throats one canvas shewed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on gallows hill whose dead face held a close kinship to theirsbut dont get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint im not a threeyearold kid and id seen much like this before it was thefaceseliot those accursedfacesthat leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life by god man i verily believe theywerealive that nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment and his brush had been a nightmarespawning wand give me that decanter eliotthere was one thing called the lessonheaven pity me that i ever saw it listencan you fancy a squatting circle of nameless doglike things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves the price of a changeling i supposeyou know the old myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes they steal pickman was shewing what happens to those stolen babeshow they grow upand then i began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and nonhuman figures he was in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly nonhuman and the degradedly human establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution the dogthings were developed from mortalsand no sooner had i wondered what he made of their own young as left with mankind in the form of changelings than my eye caught a picture embodying that very thought it was that of an ancient puritan interiora heavily beamed room with lattice windows a settle and clumsy seventeenthcentury furniture with the family sitting about while the father read from the scriptures every face but one shewed nobility and reverence but that one reflected the mockery of the pit it was that of a young man in years and no doubt belonged to a supposed son of that pious father but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things it was their changelingand in a spirit of supreme irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his ownby this time pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me asking me if i would care to see his modern studies i hadnt been able to give him much of my opinionsi was too speechless with fright and loathingbut i think he fully understood and felt highly complimented and now i want to assure you again eliot that im no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shews a bit of departure from the usual im middleaged and decently sophisticated and i guess you saw enough of me in france to know im not easily knocked out remember too that id just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial new england into a kind of annex of hell well in spite of all this that next room forced a real scream out of me and i had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over the other chamber had shewn a pack of ghouls and witches overrunning the world of our forefathers but this one brought the horror right into our own daily lifegad how that man could paint there was a study called subway accident in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the boylston street subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform another shewed a dance on copps hill among the tombs with the background of today then there were any number of cellar views with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend the stairsone disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast crosssection of beacon hill with antlike armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the resta scene in an unknown vault where scores of the beasts crowded about one who held a wellknown boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud all were pointing to a certain passage and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes the title of the picture was holmes lowell and longfellow lie buried in mount auburnas i gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity i began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing in the first place i said to myself these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous cruelty they shewed in pickman the fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement in the second place they terrified because of their very greatness their art was the art that convincedwhen we saw the pictures we saw the daemons themselves and were afraid of them and the queer part was that pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie nothing was blurred distorted or conventionalised outlines were sharp and lifelike and details were almost painfully defined and the facesit was not any mere artists interpretation that we saw it was pandemonium itself crystal clear in stark objectivity that was it by heaven the man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at allhe did not even try to give us the churning prismatic ephemera of dreams but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable mechanistic and wellestablished horrorworld which he saw fully brilliantly squarely and unfalteringly god knows what that world can have been or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through it but whatever the baffling source of his images one thing was plain pickman was in every sensein conception and in executiona thorough painstaking and almost scientificrealistmy host was now leading the way down cellar to his actual studio and i braced myself for some hellish effects among the unfinished canvases as we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he turned his flashlight to a corner of the large open space at hand revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor we walked nearer and i saw that it must be five feet across with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground levelsolid work of the seventeenth century or i was much mistaken that pickman said was the kind of thing he had been talking aboutan aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill i noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if pickmans wild hints had not been mere rhetoric i shivered slightly then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio an acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for workthe unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs and shewed the painstaking methods of the artist scenes were blocked out with extreme care and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions the man was greati say it even now knowing as much as i do a large camera on a table excited my notice and pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his outfit around the town for this or that view he thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work and declared he employed them regularlythere was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and halffinished monstrosities that leered around from every side of the room and when pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light i could not for my life keep back a loud screamthe second i had emitted that night it echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar and i had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter merciful creator eliot but i dont know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy it doesnt seem to me that earth can hold a dream like thatit was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy its position was a kind of crouch and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its present prey and seek a juicier morsel but damn it all it wasnt even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountainhead of all panicnot that nor the dog face with its pointed ears bloodshot eyes flat nose and drooling lips it wasnt the scaly claws nor the mouldcaked body nor the halfhooved feetnone of these though any one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madnessit was the technique eliotthe cursed the impious the unnatural technique as i am a living being i never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a canvas the monster was thereit glared and gnawed and gnawed and glaredand i knew that only a suspension of natures laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a modelwithout some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the fiend has ever hadpinned with a thumbtack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled upprobably i thought a photograph from which pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance i reached out to uncurl and look at it when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot he had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar and now he seemed struck with a fright which though not comparable to my own had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual he drew a revolver and motioned me to silence then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind himi think i was paralysed for an instant imitating pickmans listening i fancied i heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere and a series of squeals or bleats in a direction i couldnt determine i thought of huge rats and shuddered then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesha furtive groping kind of clatter though i cant attempt to convey what i mean in words it was like heavy wood falling on stone or brickwood on brickwhat did that make me think ofit came again and louder there was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before after that followed a sharp grating noise a shouted gibberish from pickman and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver fired spectacularly as a liontamer might fire in the air for effect a muffled squeal or squawk and a thud then more wood and brick grating a pause and the opening of the doorat which ill confess i started violently pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient wellthe deuce knows what they eat thurber he grinned for those archaic tunnels touched graveyard and witchden and seacoast but whatever it is they must have run short for they were devilish anxious to get out your yelling stirred them up i fancy better be cautious in these old placesour rodent friends are the one drawback though i sometimes think theyre a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colourwell eliot that was the end of the nights adventure pickman had promised to shew me the place and heaven knows he had done it he led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction it seems for when we sighted a lamp post we were in a halffamiliar street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses charter street it turned out to be but i was too flustered to notice just where we hit it we were too late for the elevated and walked back downtown through hanover street i remember that walk we switched from tremont up beacon and pickman left me at the corner of joy where i turned off i never spoke to him againwhy did i drop him dont be impatient wait till i ring for coffee weve had enough of the other stuff but i for one need something noit wasnt the paintings i saw in that place though ill swear they were enough to get him ostracised in ninetenths of the homes and clubs of boston and i guess you wont wonder now why i have to steer clear of subways and cellars it wassomething i found in my coat the next morning you know the curledup paper tacked to that frightful canvas in the cellar the thing i thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster that last scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it and it seems i had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket but heres the coffeetake it black eliot if youre wiseyes that paper was the reason i dropped pickman richard upton pickman the greatest artist i have ever knownand the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness eliotold reid was right he wasnt strictly human either he was born in strange shadow or hed found a way to unlock the forbidden gate its all the same now for hes goneback into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt here lets have the chandelier goingdont ask me to explain or even conjecture about what i burned dont ask me either what lay behind that molelike scrambling pickman was so keen to pass off as rats there are secrets you know which might have come down from old salem times and cotton mather tells even stranger things you know how damned lifelike pickmans paintings werehow we all wondered where he got those faceswellthat paper wasnt a photograph of any background after all what it shewed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas it was the model he was usingand its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail but by god eliotit was a photograph from life,1
searchers after horror haunt strange far places for them are the catacombs of ptolemais and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries they climb to the moonlit towers of ruined rhine castles and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in asia the haunted wood and the desolate mountain are their shrines and they linger around the sinister monoliths on uninhabited islands but the true epicure in the terrible to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence esteems most of all the ancient lonely farmhouses of backwoods new england for there the dark elements of strength solitude grotesqueness and ignorance combine to form the perfection of the hideousmost horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from travelled ways usually squatted upon some damp grassy slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread they are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow but the smallpaned windows still stare shockingly as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable thingsin such houses have dwelt generations of strange people whose like the world has never seen seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom there the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows but cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation the strength of these puritans turned into singular channels and in their isolation morbid selfrepression and struggle for life with relentless nature there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold northern heritage by necessity practical and by philosophy stern these folk were not beautiful in their sins erring as all mortals must they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed only the silent sleepy staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days and they are not communicative being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses for they must often dreamit was to a timebattered edifice of this description that i was driven one afternoon in november 1896 by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure i had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the miskatonic valley in quest of certain genealogical data and from the remote devious and problematical nature of my course had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season now i found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which i had chosen as the shortest cut to arkham overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill distant though it was from the remnant of a road the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment i espied it honest wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly and in my genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples and i did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretivei had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned yet as i approached it i was not so sure for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion therefore instead of trying the door i knocked feeling as i did so a trepidation i could scarcely explain as i waited on the rough mossy rock which served as a doorstep i glanced at the neighbouring windows and the panes of the transom above me and noticed that although old rattling and almost opaque with dirt they were not broken the building then must still be inhabited despite its isolation and general neglect however my rapping evoked no response so after repeating the summons i tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odour i entered carrying my bicycle and closed the door behind me ahead rose a narrow staircase flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floorleaning my cycle against the wall i opened the door at the left and crossed into a small lowceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way it appeared to be a kind of sittingroom for it had a table and several chairs and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel books and papers were very few and in the prevailing gloom i could not readily discern the titles what interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail most of the houses in this region i had found rich in relics of the past but here the antiquity was curiously complete for in all the room i could not discover a single article of definitely postrevolutionary date had the furnishings been less humble the place would have been a collectors paradiseas i surveyed this quaint apartment i felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house just what it was that i feared or loathed i could by no means define but something in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age of unpleasant crudeness and of secrets which should be forgotten i felt disinclined to sit down and wandered about examining the various articles which i had noticed the first object of my curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian aspect that i marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library it was bound in leather with metal fittings and was in an excellent state of preservation being altogether an unusual sort of volume to encounter in an abode so lowly when i opened it to the title page my wonder grew even greater for it proved to be nothing less rare than pigafettas account of the congo region written in latin from the notes of the sailor lopez and printed at frankfort in 1598 i had often heard of this work with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me the engravings were indeed interesting drawn wholly from imagination and careless descriptions and represented negroes with white skins and caucasian features nor would i soon have closed the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet what annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at plate xii which represented in gruesome detail a butchers shop of the cannibal anziques i experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a thing but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me especially in connexion with some adjacent passages descriptive of anzique gastronomyi had turned to a neighbouring shelf and was examining its meagre literary contentsan eighteenthcentury bible apilgrims progressof like period illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the almanackmaker isaiah thomas the rotting bulk of cotton mathersmagnalia christi americanaand a few other books of evidently equal agewhen my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of walking in the room overhead at first astonished and startled considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door i immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs the tread was heavy yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness a quality which i disliked the more because the tread was heavy when i had entered the room i had shut the door behind me now after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall i heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the panelled portal swing open againin the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that i should have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding old whitebearded and ragged my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect his height could not have been less than six feet and despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in proportion his face almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the cheeks seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect while over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years his blue eyes though a trifle bloodshot seemed inexplicably keen and burning but for his horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguishedlooking as he was impressive this unkemptness however made him offensive despite his face and figure of what his clothing consisted i could hardly tell for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of high heavy boots and his lack of cleanliness surpassed descriptionthe appearance of this man and the instinctive fear he inspired prepared me for something like enmity so that i almost shuddered through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a thin weak voice full of fawning respect and ingratiating hospitality his speech was very curious an extreme form of yankee dialect i had thought long extinct and i studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversationketched in the rain be ye he greeted glad ye was nigh the haouse en hed the sense ta come right in i calclate i was asleep else id a heerd yei aint as young as i uster be an i need a paowerful sight o naps naowadays travlin fur i haint seed many folks long this rud sence they tuk off the arkham stagei replied that i was going to arkham and apologised for my rude entry into his domicile whereupon he continuedglad ta see ye

deestrick schoolmaster in eightyfour but he quit suddent an no one never heerd on im sence here the old man lapsed into a kind of chuckle and made no explanation when i questioned him he seemed to be in an aboundingly good humour yet to possess those eccentricities which one might guess from his grooming for some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality when it struck me to ask him how he came by so rare a book as pigafettasregnum congothe effect of this volume had not left me and i felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house to my relief the question did not seem an awkward one for the old man answered freely and volublyoh thet afriky book capn ebenezer holt traded me thet in sixtyeighthim as was kilt in the war something about the name of ebenezer holt caused me to look up sharply i had encountered it in my genealogical work but not in any record since the revolution i wondered if my host could help me in the task at which i was labouring and resolved to ask him about it later on he continuedebenezer was on a salem merchantman for years an picked up a sight o queer stuff in every port he got this in london i guesshe uster like ter buy things at the shops i was up ta his haouse onct on the hill tradin hosses when i see this book i relished the picters so he give it in on a swap tis a queer bookhere leave me git on my spectacles the old man fumbled among his rags producing a pair of dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and steel bows donning these he reached for the volume on the table and turned the pages lovinglyebenezer cud read a leetle o thistis latinbut i cant i hed two er three schoolmasters read me a bit and passon clark him they say got draownded in the pondkin yew make anything outen it i told him that i could and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning if i erred he was not scholar enough to correct me for he seemed childishly pleased at my english version his proximity was becoming rather obnoxious yet i saw no way to escape without offending him i was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant old man for the pictures in a book he could not read and wondered how much better he could read the few books in english which adorned the room this revelation of simplicity removed much of the illdefined apprehension i had felt and i smiled as my host rambled onqueer haow picters kin set a body thinkin take this un here near the front hev yew ever seed trees like thet with big leaves afloppin over an daown and them menthem cant be niggersthey dew beat all kinder like injuns i guess even ef they be in afriky some o these here critters looks like monkeys or half monkeys an half men but i never heerd o nothing like this un here he pointed to a fabulous creature of the artist which one might describe as a sort of dragon with the head of an alligatorbut naow ill shew ye the best unover here nigh the middle the old mans speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter glow but his fumbling hands though seemingly clumsier than before were entirely adequate to their mission the book fell open almost of its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place to the repellent twelfth plate shewing a butchers shop amongst the anzique cannibals my sense of restlessness returned though i did not exhibit it the especially bizarre thing was that the artist had made his africans look like white menthe limbs and quarters hanging about the walls of the shop were ghastly while the butcher with his axe was hideously incongruous but my host seemed to relish the view as much as i disliked itwhat dye think o thisaint never see the like hereabouts eh when i see this i telled eb holt thats suthin ta stir ye up an make yer blood tickle when i read in scripter about slayinlike them midianites was slewi kinder think things but i

lookin at imsee whar the butcher cut off his feet thars his head on thet bench with one arm side of it an tother arms on the graound side o the meat blockas the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his hairy spectacled face became indescribable but his voice sank rather than mounted my own sensations can scarcely be recorded all the terror i had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly and i knew that i loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity his madness or at least his partial perversion seemed beyond dispute he was almost whispering now with a huskiness more terrible than a scream and i trembled as i listenedas i says tis queer haow picters sets ye thinkin dye know young sir im right sot on this un here arter i got the book off eb i uster look at it a lot especial when id heerd passon clark rant o sundays in his big wig onct i tried suthin funnyhere young sir dont git skeertall i done was ter look at the picter afore i kilt the sheep for marketkillin sheep was kinder more fun arter lookin at it the tone of the old man now sank very low sometimes becoming so faint that his words were hardly audible i listened to the rain and to the rattling of the bleared smallpaned windows and marked a rumbling of approaching thunder quite unusual for the season once a terrific flash and peal shook the frail house to its foundations but the whisperer seemed not to notice itkillin sheep was kinder more funbut dye know twant quitesatisfyinqueer haow acravingits a holt on ye as ye love the almighty young man

meat makes blood an flesh an gives ye new life so i wondered ef twudnt make a man live longer an longer ef twasmore the same but the whisperer never continued the interruption was not produced by my fright nor by the rapidly increasing storm amidst whose fury i was presently to open my eyes on a smoky solitude of blackened ruins it was produced by a very simple though somewhat unusual happeningthe open book lay flat between us with the picture staring repulsively upward as the old man whispered the wordsmore the samea tiny spattering impact was heard and something shewed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume i thought of the rain and of a leaky roof but rain is not red on the butchers shop of the anzique cannibals a small red spattering glistened picturesquely lending vividness to the horror of the engraving the old man saw it and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it necessary saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an hour before i followed his glance and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as i viewed it i did not shriek or move but merely shut my eyes a moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts blasting that accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind,1
a damp gloomy evening in april it was just after the close of the great war when marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and wishes unheardof yearnings which floated out of the spacious twentiethcentury drawingroom up the misty deeps of the air and eastward to far olivegroves in arcady which she had seen only in her dreams she had entered the room in abstraction turned off the glaring chandeliers and now reclined on a soft divan by a solitary lamp which shed over the reading table a green glow as soothing and delicious as moonlight through the foliage about an antique shrine attired simply in a lowcut evening dress of black she appeared outwardly a typical product of modern civilisation but tonight she felt the immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic surroundings was it because of the strange home in which she lived that abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the inmates scarcely more than strangers was it that or was it some greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space whereby she had been born too late too early or too far away from the haunts of her spirit ever to harmonise with the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality to dispel the mood which was engulfing her more deeply each moment she took a magazine from the table and searched for some healing bit of poetry poetry had always relieved her troubled mind better than anything else though many things in the poetry she had seen detracted from the influence over parts of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapour of sterile ugliness and restraint like dust on a windowpane through which one views a magnificent sunsetlistlessly turning the magazines pages as if searching for an elusive treasure she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor an observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had discovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her unattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before it was only a bit ofvers librethat pitiful compromise of the poet who overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers but it had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels and who gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty devoid of regularity it yet had the wild harmony of winged spontaneous words a harmony missing from the formal conventionbound verse she had known as she read on her surroundings gradually faded and soon there lay about her only the mists of dream the purple starstrown mists beyond time where only gods and dreamers walkmoon over japanwhite butterfly moonwhere the heavylidded buddhas dreamto the sound of the cuckoos call the white wings of moonbutterfliesflicker down the streets of the cityblushing into

caduceusbearing and of a beauty like to nothing on earth before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which apollo had given him in trade for the ninecorded shell of melody and upon her brow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses then adoring hermes spokeo nymph more fair than the goldenhaired sisters of cyane or the skyinhabiting atlantides beloved of aphrodite and blessed of pallas thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the gods which lieth in beauty and song o prophetess more lovely than the sybil of cumae when apollo first knew her though hast truly spoken of the new age for even now on maenalus pan sighs and stretches in his sleep wishful to awake and behold about him the little rosecrowned fauns and the antique satyrs in thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal else saving only a few whom the world rejects remembereththat the gods were never deadbut only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of gods in lotosfilled hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset and now draweth nigh the time of their awaking when coldness and ugliness shall perish and zeus sit once more on olympus already the sea about paphos trembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on before and at night on helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings and halfremembered notes woods and fields are tremulous at twilight with the shimmering of white saltant forms and immemorial ocean yields up curious sights beneath thin moons the gods are patient and have slept long but neither man nor giant shall defy the gods forever in tartarus the titans writhe and beneath the fiery aetna groan the children of uranus and gaea the day now dawns when man must answer for centuries of denial but in sleeping the gods have grown kind and will not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of gods instead will their vengeance smite the darkness fallacy and ugliness which have turned the mind of man and under the sway of bearded saturnus shall mortals once more sacrificing unto him dwell in beauty and delight this night shalt thou know the favour of the gods and behold on parnassus those dreams which the gods have through ages sent to earth to shew that they are not dead for poets are the dreams of the gods and in each age someone hath sung unknowing the message and the promise from the lotosgardens beyond the sunsetthen in his arms hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies gentle breezes from the tower of aiolos wafted them high above warm scented seas till suddenly they came upon zeus holding court on the doubleheaded parnassus his golden throne flanked by apollo and the muses on the right hand and by ivywreathed dionysus and pleasureflushed bacchae on the left hand so much of splendour marcia had never seen before either awake or in dreams but its radiance did her no injury as would have the radiance of lofty olympus for in this lesser court the father of gods had tempered his glories for the sight of mortals before the laureldraped mouth of the corycian cave sat in a row six noble forms with the aspect of mortals but the countenances of gods these the dreamer recognised from images of them which she had beheld and she knew that they were none else than the divine maeonides the avernian dante the more than mortal shakespeare the chaosexploring milton the cosmic goethe and the musaean keats these were those messengers whom the gods had sent to tell men that pan had passed not away but only slept for it is in poetry that gods speak to men then spake the thunderero daughterfor being one of my endless line thou art indeed my daughterbehold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers that gods have sent down that in the words and writings of men there may be still some trace of divine beauty other bards have men justly crowned with enduring laurels but these hath apollo crowned and these have i set in places apart as mortals who have spoken the language of the gods long have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the west and spoken only through our dreams but the time approaches when our voices shall not be silent it is a time of awaking and of change once more hath phaeton ridden low searing the fields and drying the streams in gaul lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no more and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals ares and his train have gone forth with the madness of gods and have returned deimos and phobos glutted with unnatural delight tellus moans with grief and the faces of men are as the faces of the erinyes even as when astraea fled to the skies and the waves of our bidding encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone amidst this chaos prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival even now toileth our latestborn messenger in whose dreams are all the images which other messengers have dreamed before him he it is that we have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the world hath known before and to write words wherein shall echo all the wisdom and the loveliness of the past he it is who shall proclaim our return and sing of the days to come when fauns and dryads shall haunt their accustomed groves in beauty guided was our choice by those who now sit before the corycian grotto on thrones of ivory and in whose songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shalt know the greater messenger when he cometh attend their voices as one by one they sing to thee here each note shalt thou hear again in the poetry which is to come the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy soul though search for it through bleak years thou must attend with diligence for each chord that vibrates away into hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to earth as alpheus sinking his waters into the soul of hellas appears as the crystal arethusa in remote siciliathen arose homeros the ancient among bards who took his lyre and chaunted his hymn to aphrodite no word of greek did marcia know yet did the message not fall vainly upon her ears for in the cryptic rhythm was that which spake to all mortals and gods and needed no interpreterso too the songs of dante and goethe whose unknown words clave the ether with melodies easy to read and to adore but at last remembered accents resounded before the listener it was the swan of avon once a god among men and still a god among godswrite write that from the bloody course of warmy dearest master your dear son may hiebless him at home in peace whilst i from farhis name with

saystbeauty is truthtruth beautythat is allye know on earth and all ye need to knowas the singer ceased there came a sound in the wind blowing from far egypt where at night aurora mourns by the nile for her slain son memnon to the feet of the thunderer flew the rosyfingered goddess and kneeling cried master it is time i unlocked the gates of the east and phoebus handing his lyre to calliope his bride among the muses prepared to depart for the jewelled and columnraised palace of the sun where fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of day so zeus descended from his carven throne and placed his hand upon the head of marcia sayingdaughter the dawn is nigh and it is well that thou shouldst return before the awaking of mortals to thy home weep not at the bleakness of thy life for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the gods shall once more walk among men search thou unceasingly for our messenger for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth as zeus ceased the young hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading stars up and westward over unseen seasmany years have passed since marcia dreamt of the gods and of their parnassian conclave tonight she sits in the same spacious drawingroom but she is not alone gone is the old spirit of unrest for beside her is one whose name is luminous with celebrity the young poet of poets at whose feet sits all the world he is reading from a manuscript words which none has ever heard before but which when heard will bring to men the dreams and fancies they lost so many centuries ago when pan lay down to doze in arcady and the greater gods withdrew to sleep in lotosgardens beyond the lands of the hesperides in the subtle cadences and hidden melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden has found rest at last for there echo the divinest notes of thracian orpheus notes that moved the very rocks and trees by hebrus banks the singer ceases and with eagerness asks a verdict yet what can marcia say but that the strain is fit for the godsand as she speaks there comes again a vision of parnassus and the faroff sound of a mighty voice saying by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth,1
into the north window of my chamber glows the pole star with uncanny light all through the long hellish hours of blackness it shines there and in the autumn of the year when the winds from the north curse and whine and the redleaved trees of the swamp mutter things to one another in the small hours of the morning under the horned waning moon i sit by the casement and watch that star down from the heights reels the glittering cassiopeia as the hours wear on while charles wain lumbers up from behind the vapoursoaked swamp trees that sway in the nightwind just before dawn arcturus winks ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock and coma berenices shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east but still the pole star leers down from the same place in the black vault winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey sometimes when it is cloudy i can sleepwell do i remember the night of the great aurora when over the swamp played the shocking coruscations of the daemonlight after the beams came clouds and then i sleptand it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the first time still and somnolent did it lie on a strange plateau in a hollow betwixt strange peaks of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers its columns domes and pavements in the marble streets were marble pillars the upper parts of which were carven into the images of grave bearded men the air was warm and stirred not and overhead scarce ten degrees from the zenith glowed that watching pole star long did i gaze on the city but the day came not when the red aldebaran which blinked low in the sky but never set had crawled a quarter of the way around the horizon i saw light and motion in the houses and the streets forms strangely robed but at once noble and familiar walked abroad and under the horned waning moon men talked wisdom in a tongue which i understood though it was unlike any language i had ever known and when the red aldebaran had crawled more than half way around the horizon there were again darkness and silencewhen i awaked i was not as i had been upon my memory was graven the vision of the city and within my soul had arisen another and vaguer recollection of whose nature i was not then certain thereafter on the cloudy nights when i could sleep i saw the city often sometimes under that horned waning moon and sometimes under the hot yellow rays of a sun which did not set but which wheeled low around the horizon and on the clear nights the pole star leered as never beforegradually i came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks at first content to view the scene as an allobservant uncorporeal presence i now desired to define my relation to it and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public squares i said to myself this is no dream for by what means can i prove the greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock where the pole star peers into my north window each nightone night as i listened to the discourse in the large square containing many statues i felt a change and perceived that i had at last a bodily form nor was i a stranger in the streets of olatho which lies on the plateau of sarkis betwixt the peaks noton and kadiphonek it was my friend alos who spoke and his speech was one that pleased my soul for it was the speech of a true man and patriot that night had the news come of daikos fall and of the advance of the inutos squat hellish yellow fiends who five years ago had appeared out of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom and finally to besiege our towns having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains their way now lay open to the plateau unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men for the squat creatures were mighty in the arts of war and knew not the scruples of honour which held back our tall greyeyed men of lomar from ruthless conquestalos my friend was commander of all the forces on the plateau and in him lay the last hope of our country on this occasion he spoke of the perils to be faced and exhorted the men of olatho bravest of the lomarians to sustain the traditions of their ancestors who when forced to move southward from zobna before the advance of the great icesheet even as our descendants must some day flee from the land of lomar valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy longarmed cannibal gnophkehs that stood in their way to me alos denied a warriors part for i was feeble and given to strange faintings when subjected to stress and hardships but my eyes were the keenest in the city despite the long hours i gave each day to the study of the pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom of the zobnarian fathers so my friend desiring not to doom me to inaction rewarded me with that duty which was second to nothing in importance to the watchtower of thapnen he sent me there to serve as the eyes of our army should the inutos attempt to gain the citadel by the narrow pass behind the peak noton and thereby surprise the garrison i was to give the signal of fire which would warn the waiting soldiers and save the town from immediate disasteralone i mounted the tower for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below my brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue for i had not slept in many days yet was my purpose firm for i loved my native land of lomar and the marble city of olatho that lies betwixt the peaks of noton and kadiphonekbut as i stood in the towers topmost chamber i beheld the horned waning moon red and sinister quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of banof and through an opening in the roof glittered the pale pole star fluttering as if alive and leering like a fiend and tempter methought its spirit whispered evil counsel soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and overslumber watcher till the spheressix and twenty thousand yearshave revolvd and i returnto the spot where now i burnother stars anon shall riseto the axis of the skiesstars that soothe and stars that blesswith a sweet forgetfulnessonly when my round is oershall the past disturb thy doorvainly did i struggle with my drowsiness seeking to connect these strange words with some lore of the skies which i had learnt from the pnakotic manuscripts my head heavy and reeling drooped to my breast and when next i looked up it was in a dream with the pole star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dreamswamp and i am still dreamingin my shame and despair i sometimes scream frantically begging the dreamcreatures around me to waken me ere the inutos steal up the pass behind the peak noton and take the citadel by surprise but these creatures are daemons for they laugh at me and tell me i am not dreaming they mock me whilst i sleep and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us i have failed in my duty and betrayed the marble city of olatho i have proven false to alos my friend and commander but still these shadows of my dream deride me they say there is no land of lomar save in my nocturnal imaginings that in those realms where the pole star shines high and red aldebaran crawls low around the horizon there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years and never a man save squat yellow creatures blighted by the cold whom they call esquimauxand as i writhe in my guilty agony frantic to save the city whose peril every moment grows and vainly striving to shake off this unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock the pole star evil and monstrous leers down from the black vault winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey,1
into the granite city of teloth wandered the youth vinecrowned his yellow hair glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers of the mountain sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone the men of teloth are dark and stern and dwell in square houses and with frowns they asked the stranger whence he had come and what were his name and fortune so the youth answeredi am iranon and come from aira a far city that i recall only dimly but seek to find again i am a singer of songs that i learned in the far city and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered of childhood my wealth is in little memories and dreams and in hopes that i sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs the lotosbudswhen the men of teloth heard these things they whispered to one another for though in the granite city there is no laughter or song the stern men sometimes look to the karthian hills in the spring and think of the lutes of distant oonai whereof travellers have told and thinking thus they bade the stranger stay and sing in the square before the tower of mlin though they liked not the colour of his tattered robe nor the myrrh in his hair nor his chaplet of vineleaves nor the youth in his golden voice at evening iranon sang and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singers head but most of the men of teloth yawned and some laughed and some went away to sleep for iranon told nothing useful singing only his memories his dreams and his hopesi remember the twilight the moon and soft songs and the window where i was rocked to sleep and through the window was the street where the golden lights came and where the shadows danced on houses of marble i remember the square of moonlight on the floor that was not like any other light and the visions that danced in the moonbeams when my mother sang to me and too i remember the sun of morning bright above the manycoloured hills in summer and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees singo aira city of marble and beryl how many are thy beauties how loved i the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline nithra and the falls of the tiny kra that flowed through the verdant valley in those groves and in that vale the children wove wreaths for one another and at dusk i dreamed strange dreams under the yathtrees on the mountain as i saw below me the lights of the city and the curving nithra reflecting a ribbon of starsand in the city were palaces of veined and tinted marble with golden domes and painted walls and green gardens with cerulean pools and crystal fountains often i played in the gardens and waded in the pools and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees and sometimes at sunset i would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place and look down upon aira the magic city of marble and beryl splendid in a robe of golden flamelong have i missed thee aira for i was but young when we went into exile but my father was thy king and i shall come again to thee for it is so decreed of fate all through seven lands have i sought thee and some day shall i reign over thy groves and gardens thy streets and palaces and sing to men who shall know whereof i sing and laugh not nor turn away for i am iranon who was a prince in airathat night the men of teloth lodged the stranger in a stable and in the morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of athok the cobbler and be apprenticed to himbut i am iranon a singer of songs he said and have no heart for the cobblers tradeall in teloth must toil replied the archon for that is the law then said iranonwherefore do ye toil is it not that ye may live and be happy and if ye toil only that ye may toil more when shall happiness find you ye toil to live but is not life made of beauty and song and if ye suffer no singers among you where shall be the fruits of your toil toil without song is like a weary journey without an end were not death more pleasing but the archon was sullen and did not understand and rebuked the strangerthou art a strange youth and i like not thy face nor thy voice the words thou speakest are blasphemy for the gods of teloth have said that toil is good our gods have promised us a haven of light beyond death where there shall be rest without end and crystal coldness amidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty go thou then to athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset all here must serve and song is follyso iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone streets between the gloomy square houses of granite seeking something green in the air of spring but in teloth was nothing green for all was of stone on the faces of men were frowns but by the stone embankment along the sluggish river zuro sate a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the freshets and the boy said to himart thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell who seekest a far city in a fair land i am romnod and born of the blood of teloth but am not old in the ways of the granite city and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song beyond the karthian hills lieth oonai the city of lutes and dancing which men whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible thither would i go were i old enough to find the way and thither shouldst thou go an thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee let us leave the city teloth and fare together among the hills of spring thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and i will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers and peradventure it may be that oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair aira thou seekest for it is told that thou hast not known aira since old days and a name often changeth let us go to oonai o iranon of the golden head where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers nor ever laugh or frown at what we say and iranon answeredbe it so small one if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains and beyond and i would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish zuro but think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the karthian hills or in any spot thou canst find in a days or a years or a lustrums journey behold when i was small like thee i dwelt in the valley of narthos by the frigid xari where none would listen to my dreams and i told myself that when older i would go to sinara on the southern slope and sing to smiling dromedarymen in the marketplace but when i went to sinara i found the dromedarymen all drunken and ribald and saw that their songs were not as mine so i travelled in a barge down the xari to onyxwalled jaren and the soldiers at jaren laughed at me and drave me out so that i wandered to many other cities i have seen stethelos that is below the great cataract and have gazed on the marsh where sarnath once stood i have been to thraa ilarnek and kadatheron on the winding river ai and have dwelt long in olatho in the land of lomar but though i have had listeners sometimes they have ever been few and i know that welcome shall await me only in aira the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as king so for aira shall we seek though it were well to visit distant and luteblessed oonai across the karthian hills which may indeed be aira though i think not airas beauty is past imagining and none can tell of it without rapture whilst of oonai the cameldrivers whisper leeringlyat the sunset iranon and small romnod went forth from teloth and for long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests the way was rough and obscure and never did they seem nearer to oonai the city of lutes and dancing but in the dusk as the stars came out iranon would sing of aira and its beauties and romnod would listen so that they were both happy after a fashion they ate plentifully of fruit and red berries and marked not the passing of time but many years must have slipped away small romnod was now not so small and spoke deeply instead of shrilly though iranon was always the same and decked his golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods so it came to pass one day that romnod seemed older than iranon though he had been very small when iranon had found him watching for green budding branches in teloth beside the sluggish stonebanked zurothen one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of oonai peasants had told them they were near and iranon knew that this was not his native city of aira the lights of oonai were not like those of aira for they were harsh and glaring while the lights of aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where iranons mother once rocked him to sleep with song but oonai was a city of lutes and dancing so iranon and romnod went down the steep slope that they might find men to whom songs and dreams would bring pleasure and when they were come into the town they found rosewreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies who listened to the songs of iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done then for a moment did iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he though the town was not an hundredth as fair as airawhen dawn came iranon looked about with dismay for the domes of oonai were not golden in the sun but grey and dismal and the men of oonai were pale with revelling and dull with wine and unlike the radiant men of aira but because the people had thrown him blossoms and acclaimed his songs iranon stayed on and with him romnod who liked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle often at night iranon sang to the revellers but he was always as before crowned only with the vine of the mountains and remembering the marble streets of aira and the hyaline nithra in the frescoed halls of the monarch did he sing upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was a mirror and as he sang he brought pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old beautiful and halfremembered things instead of the winereddened feasters who pelted him with roses and the king bade him put away his tattered purple and clothed him in satin and clothofgold with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flowerembroidered silk thus dwelt iranon in oonai the city of lutes and dancingit is not known how long iranon tarried in oonai but one day the king brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the liranian desert and dusky fluteplayers from drinen in the east and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at iranon as at the dancers and the fluteplayers and day by day that romnod who had been a small boy in granite teloth grew coarser and redder with wine till he dreamed less and less and listened with less delight to the songs of iranon but though iranon was sad he ceased not to sing and at evening told again his dreams of aira the city of marble and beryl then one night the red and fattened romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied silks of his banquetcouch and died writhing whilst iranon pale and slender sang to himself in a far corner and when iranon had wept over the grave of romnod and strown it with green budding branches such as romnod used to love he put aside his silks and gauds and went forgotten out of oonai the city of lutes and dancing clad only in the ragged purple in which he had come and garlanded with fresh vines from the mountainsinto the sunset wandered iranon seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand and cherish his songs and dreams in all the cities of cydathria and in the lands beyond the bnazic desert gayfaced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple but iranon stayed ever young and wore wreaths upon his golden head whilst he sang of aira delight of the past and hope of the futureso came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd bent and dirty who kept lean flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh to this man iranon spoke as to so many otherscanst thou tell me where i may find aira the city of marble and beryl where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny kra sing to verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees and the shepherd hearing looked long and strangely at iranon as if recalling something very far away in time and noted each line of the strangers face and his golden hair and his crown of vineleaves but he was old and shook his head as he repliedo stranger i have indeed heard the name of aira and the other names thou hast spoken but they come to me from afar down the waste of long years i heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate a beggars boy given to strange dreams who would weave long tales about the moon and the flowers and the west wind we used to laugh at him for we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a kings son he was comely even as thou but full of folly and strangeness and he ran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and dreams how often hath he sung to me of lands that never were and things that never can be of aira did he speak much of aira and the river nithra and the falls of the tiny kra there would he ever say he once dwelt as a prince though here we knew him from his birth nor was there ever a marble city of aira nor those who could delight in strange songs save in the dreams of mine old playmate iranon who is goneand in the twilight as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast on the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening there walked into the lethal quicksands a very old man in tattered purple crowned with withered vineleaves and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city where dreams are understood that night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world,1
on july 16 1923 i moved into exham priory after the last workman had finished his labours the restoration had been a stupendous task for little had remained of the deserted pile but a shelllike ruin yet because it had been the seat of my ancestors i let no expense deter me the place had not been inhabited since the reign of james the first when a tragedy of intensely hideous though largely unexplained nature had struck down the master five of his children and several servants and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line with this sole heir denounced as a murderer the estate had reverted to the crown nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or regain his property shaken by some horror greater than that of conscience or the law and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the ancient edifice from his sight and memory walter de la poer eleventh baron exham fled to virginia and there founded the family which by the next century had become known as delaporeexham priory had remained untenanted though later allotted to the estates of the norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite architecture an architecture involving gothic towers resting on a saxon or romanesque substructure whose foundation in turn was of a still earlier order or blend of ordersroman and even druidic or native cymric if legends speak truly this foundation was a very singular thing being merged on one side with the solid limestone of the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley three miles west of the village of anchester architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of forgotten centuries but the country folk hated it they had hated it hundreds of years before when my ancestors lived there and they hated it now with the moss and mould of abandonment on it i had not been a day in anchester before i knew i came of an accursed house and this week workmen have blown up exham priory and are busy obliterating the traces of its foundationsthe bare statistics of my ancestry i had always known together with the fact that my first american forbear had come to the colonies under a strange cloud of details however i had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always maintained by the delapores unlike our planter neighbours we seldom boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and renaissance heroes nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the civil war by every squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening the glories we cherished were those achieved since the migration the glories of a proud and honourable if somewhat reserved and unsocial virginia lineduring the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence changed by the burning of carfax our home on the banks of the james my grandfather advanced in years had perished in that incendiary outrage and with him the envelope that bound us all to the past i can recall that fire today as i saw it then at the age of seven with the federal soldiers shouting the women screaming and the negroes howling and praying my father was in the army defending richmond and after many formalities my mother and i were passed through the lines to join him when the war ended we all moved north whence my mother had come and i grew to manhood middle age and ultimate wealth as a stolid yankee neither my father nor i ever knew what our hereditary envelope had contained and as i merged into the greyness of massachusetts business life i lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far back in my family tree had i suspected their nature how gladly i would have left exham priory to its moss bats and cobwebsmy father died in 1904 but without any message to leave me or to my only child alfred a motherless boy of ten it was this boy who reversed the order of family information for although i could give him only jesting conjectures about the past he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to england in 1917 as an aviation officer apparently the delapores had a colourful and perhaps sinister history for a friend of my sons capt edward norrys of the royal flying corps dwelt near the family seat at anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness and incredibility norrys himself of course did not take them seriously but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to me it was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which norrys shewed to alfred in its picturesque desertion and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure since his own uncle was the present owneri bought exham priory in 1918 but was almost immediately distracted from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid during the two years that he lived i thought of nothing but his care having even placed my business under the direction of partners in 1921 as i found myself bereaved and aimless a retired manufacturer no longer young i resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession visiting anchester in december i was entertained by capt norrys a plump amiable young man who had thought much of my son and secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration exham priory itself i saw without emotion a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks nests perched perilously upon a precipice and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate towersas i gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my ancestor left it over three centuries before i began to hire workmen for the reconstruction in every case i was forced to go outside the immediate locality for the anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place this sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers causing numerous desertions whilst its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient familymy son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because he was a de la poer and i now found myself subtly ostracised for a like reason until i convinced the peasants how little i knew of my heritage even then they sullenly disliked me so that i had to collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of norrys what the people could not forgive perhaps was that i had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent to them for rationally or not they viewed exham priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and werewolvespiecing together the tales which norrys collected for me and supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied the ruins i deduced that exham priory stood on the site of a prehistoric temple a druidical or antedruidical thing which must have been contemporary with stonehenge that indescribable rites had been celebrated there few doubted and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of these rites into the cybeleworship which the romans had introduced inscriptions still visible in the subcellar bore such unmistakable letters as div ops magna mat sign of the magna mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to roman citizens anchester had been the camp of the third augustan legion as many remains attest and it was said that the temple of cybele was splendid and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the bidding of a phrygian priest tales added that the fall of the old religion did not end the orgies at the temple but that the priests lived on in the new faith without real change likewise was it said that the rites did not vanish with the roman power and that certain among the saxons added to what remained of the temple and gave it the essential outline it subsequently preserved making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy about 1000 ad the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace it was never destroyed by the danes though after the norman conquest it must have declined tremendously since there was no impediment when henry the third granted the site to my ancestor gilbert de la poer first baron exham in 1261of my family before this date there is no evil report but something strange must have happened then in one chronicle there is a reference to a de la poer as cursed of god in 1307 whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and priory the fireside tales were of the most grisly description all the ghastlier because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness they represented my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom gilles de retz and the marquis de sade would seem the veriest tyros and hinted whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearance of villagers through several generationsthe worst characters apparently were the barons and their direct heirs at least most was whispered about these if of healthier inclinations it was said an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion there seemed to be an inner cult in the family presided over by the head of the house and sometimes closed except to a few members temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult for it was entered by several who married into the family lady margaret trevor from cornwall wife of godfrey the second son of the fifth baron became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the welsh border preserved in balladry too though not illustrating the same point is the hideous tale of lady mary de la poer who shortly after her marriage to the earl of shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the worldthese myths and ballads typical as they were of crude superstition repelled me greatly their persistence and their application to so long a line of my ancestors were especially annoying whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forbearsthe case of my cousin young randolph delapore of carfax who went among the negroes and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the mexican wari was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the barren windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains of the floundering squealing white thing on which sir john claves horse had trod one night in a lonely field and of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day these things were hackneyed spectral lore and i was at that time a pronounced sceptic the accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed though not especially significant in view of mediaeval custom prying curiosity meant death and more than one severed head had been publicly shewn on the bastionsnow effacedaround exham priorya few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque and made me wish i had learnt more of comparative mythology in my youth there was for instance the belief that a legion of batwinged devils kept witches sabbath each night at the priorya legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens and most vivid of all there was the dramatic epic of the ratsthe scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertionthe lean filthy ravenous army which had swept all before it and devoured fowl cats dogs hogs sheep and even two hapless human beings before its fury was spent around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its trainsuch was the lore that assailed me as i pushed to completion with an elderly obstinacy the work of restoring my ancestral home it must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment on the other hand i was constantly praised and encouraged by capt norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me when the task was done over two years after its commencement i viewed the great rooms wainscotted walls vaulted ceilings mullioned windows and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration every attribute of the middle ages was cunningly reproduced and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations the seat of my fathers was complete and i looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me i would reside here permanently and prove that a de la poer for i had adopted again the original spelling of the name need not be a fiend my comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that although exham priory was mediaevally fitted its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alikeas i have said i moved in on july 16 1923 my household consisted of seven servants and nine cats of which latter species i am particularly fond my eldest cat niggerman was seven years old and had come with me from my home in bolton massachusetts the others i had accumulated whilst living with capt norrys family during the restoration of the priory for five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data i had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of walter de la poer which i conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at carfax it appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household except four servant confederates in their sleep about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour but which except by implication he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterward fled beyond reachthis deliberate slaughter which included a father three brothers and two sisters was largely condoned by the villagers and so slackly treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured unharmed and undisguised to virginia the general whispered sentiment being that he had purged the land of an immemorial curse what discovery had prompted an act so terrible i could scarcely even conjecture walter de la poer must have known for years the sinister tales about his family so that this material could have given him no fresh impulse had he then witnessed some appalling ancient rite or stumbled upon some frightful and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity he was reputed to have been a shy gentle youth in england in virginia he seemed not so much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive he was spoken of in the diary of another gentlemanadventurer francis harley of bellview as a man of unexampled justice honour and delicacyon july 22 occurred the first incident which though lightly dismissed at the time takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events it was so simple as to be almost negligible and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances for it must be recalled that since i was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls and surrounded by a wellbalanced staff of servitors apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality what i afterward remembered is merely thisthat my old black cat whose moods i know so well was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character he roved from room to room restless and disturbed and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the old gothic structure i realise how trite this soundslike the inevitable dog in the ghost story which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figureyet i cannot consistently suppress itthe following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house he came to me in my study a lofty west room on the second story with groined arches black oak panelling and a triple gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley and even as he spoke i saw the jetty form of niggerman creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone i told the man that there must be some singular odour or emanation from the old stonework imperceptible to human senses but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork this i truly believed and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats i mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls where they had never been known to stray that afternoon i called on capt norrys and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashionthat night dispensing as usual with a valet i retired in the west tower chamber which i had chosen as my own reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallerythe former partly ancient the latter entirely restored this room was circular very high and without wainscotting being hung with arras which i had myself chosen in london seeing that niggerman was with me i shut the heavy gothic door and retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited candles finally switching off the light and sinking on the carved and canopied fourposter with the venerable cat in his accustomed place across my feet i did not draw the curtains but gazed out at the narrow north window which i faced there was a suspicion of aurora in the sky and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly silhouettedat some time i must have fallen quietly asleep for i recall a distinct sense of leaving strange dreams when the cat started violently from his placid position i saw him in the faint auroral glow head strained forward fore feet on my ankles and hind feet stretched behind he was looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it but toward which all my attention was now directed and as i watched i knew that niggerman was not vainly excited whether the arras actually moved i cannot say i think it did very slightly but what i can swear to is that behind it i heard a low distinct scurrying as of rats or mice in a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening tapestry bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight and exposing a damp ancient wall of stone patched here and there by the restorers and devoid of any trace of rodent prowlers niggerman raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the wall and the oaken floor he found nothing and after a time returned wearily to his place across my feet i had not moved but i did not sleep again that nightin the morning i questioned all the servants and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill this cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs i drowsed away the noontime and in the afternoon called again on capt norrys who became exceedingly interested in what i told him the odd incidentsso slight yet so curiousappealed to his sense of the picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscences of local ghostly lore we were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats and norrys lent me some traps and paris green which i had the servants place in strategic localities when i returnedi retired early being very sleepy but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort i seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto kneedeep with filth where a whitebearded daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing then as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alikefrom this terrific vision i was abruptly awaked by the motions of niggerman who had been sleeping as usual across my feet this time i did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle unconscious of their effect for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous soundthe verminous slithering of ravenous gigantic rats there was now no aurora to shew the state of the arrasthe fallen section of which had been replacedbut i was not too frightened to switch on the lightas the bulbs leapt into radiance i saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death this motion disappeared almost at once and the sound with it springing out of bed i poked at the arras with the long handle of a warmingpan that rested near and lifted one section to see what lay beneath there was nothing but the patched stone wall and even the cat had lost his tense realisation of abnormal presences when i examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room i found all of the openings sprung though no trace remained of what had been caught and had escapedfurther sleep was out of the question so lighting a candle i opened the door and went out in the gallery toward the stairs to my study niggerman following at my heels before we had reached the stone steps however the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight as i descended the stairs myself i became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken the oakpanelled walls were alive with rats scampering and milling whilst niggerman was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter reaching the bottom i switched on the light which did not this time cause the noise to subside the rats continued their riot stampeding with such force and distinctness that i could finally assign to their motions a definite direction these creatures in numbers apparently inexhaustible were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or inconceivably belowi now heard steps in the corridor and in another moment two servants pushed open the massive door they were searching the house for some unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat yowling before the closed door to the subcellar i asked them if they had heard the rats but they replied in the negative and when i turned to call their attention to the sounds in the panels i realised that the noise had ceased with the two men i went down to the door of the subcellar but found the cats already dispersed later i resolved to explore the crypt below but for the present i merely made a round of the traps all were sprung yet all were tenantless satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me i sat in my study till morning thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend i had unearthed concerning the building i inhabitedi slept some in the forenoon leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of furnishing could not banish later i telephoned to capt norrys who came over and helped me explore the subcellar absolutely nothing untoward was found although we could not repress a thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by roman hands every low arch and massive pillar was romannot the debased romanesque of the bungling saxons but the severe and harmonious classicism of the age of the caesars indeed the walls abounded with inscriptions familiar to the antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the placethings like pgetae prop temp dona and l praec vs pontifi atys the reference to atys made me shiver for i had read catullus and knew something of the hideous rites of the eastern god whose worship was so mixed with that of cybele norrys and i by the light of lanterns tried to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain irregularly rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars but could make nothing of them we remembered that one pattern a sort of rayed sun was held by students to imply a nonroman origin suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the roman priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site on one of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder the largest in the centre of the room had certain features on the upper surface which indicated its connexion with fireprobably burnt offeringssuch were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats had howled and where norrys and i now determined to pass the night couches were brought down by the servants who were told not to mind any nocturnal actions of the cats and niggerman was admitted as much for help as for companionship we decided to keep the great oak doora modern replica with slits for ventilationtightly closed and with this attended to we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever might occurthe vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory and undoubtedly far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff overlooking the waste valley that it had been the goal of the scuffling and unexplainable rats i could not doubt though why i could not tell as we lay there expectantly i found my vigil occasionally mixed with halfformed dreams from which the uneasy motions of the cat across my feet would rouse me these dreams were not wholesome but horribly like the one i had had the night before i saw again the twilit grotto and the swineherd with his unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth and as i looked at these things they seemed nearer and more distinctso distinct that i could almost observe their features then i did observe the flabby features of one of themand awaked with such a scream that niggerman started up whilst capt norrys who had not slept laughed considerably norrys might have laughed moreor perhaps lesshad he known what it was that made me scream but i did not remember myself till later ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful waynorrys waked me when the phenomena began out of the same frightful dream i was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to the cats indeed there was much to listen to for beyond the closed door at the head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline yelling and clawing whilst niggerman unmindful of his kindred outside was running excitedly around the bare stone walls in which i heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the night beforean acute terror now rose within me for here were anomalies which nothing normal could well explain these rats if not the creatures of a madness which i shared with the cats alone must be burrowing and sliding in roman walls i had thought to be of solid limestone blocks unless perhaps the action of water through more than seventeen centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear and ample but even so the spectral horror was no less for if these were living vermin why did not norrys hear their disgusting commotion why did he urge me to watch niggerman and listen to the cats outside and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could have aroused themby the time i had managed to tell him as rationally as i could what i thought i was hearing my ears gave me the last fading impression of the scurrying which had retreatedstill downwardfar underneath this deepest of subcellars till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were riddled with questing rats norrys was not as sceptical as i had anticipated but instead seemed profoundly moved he motioned to me to notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour as if giving up the rats for lost whilst niggerman had a burst of renewed restlessness and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the large stone altar in the centre of the room which was nearer norrys couch than minemy fear of the unknown was at this point very great something astounding had occurred and i saw that capt norrys a younger stouter and presumably more naturally materialistic man was affected fully as much as myselfperhaps because of his lifelong and intimate familiarity with local legend we could for the moment do nothing but watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base of the altar occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some favour for himnorrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place where niggerman was pawing silently kneeling and scraping away the lichens of centuries which joined the massive preroman block to the tessellated floor he did not find anything and was about to abandon his effort when i noticed a trivial circumstance which made me shudder even though it implied nothing more than i had already imagined i told him of it and we both looked at its almost imperceptible manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and acknowledgment it was only thisthat the flame of the lantern set down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a draught of air which it had not before received and which came indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where norrys was scraping away the lichenswe spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly lighted study nervously discussing what we should do next the discovery that some vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the romans underlay this accursed pilesome vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centurieswould have been sufficient to excite us without any background of the sinister as it was the fascination became twofold and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the priory forever in superstitious caution or to gratify our sense of adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths by morning we had compromised and decided to go to london to gather a group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery it should be mentioned that before leaving the subcellar we had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognised as the gate to a new pit of nameless fear what secret would open the gate wiser men than we would have to findduring many days in london capt norrys and i presented our facts conjectures and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities all men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future explorations might develop we found most of them little disposed to scoff but instead intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic it is hardly necessary to name them all but i may say that they included sir william brinton whose excavations in the troad excited most of the world in their day as we all took the train for anchester i felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations a sensation symbolised by the air of mourning among the many americans at the unexpected death of the president on the other side of the worldon the evening of august 7th we reached exham priory where the servants assured me that nothing unusual had occurred the cats even old niggerman had been perfectly placid and not a trap in the house had been sprung we were to begin exploring on the following day awaiting which i assigned wellappointed rooms to all my guests i myself retired in my own tower chamber with niggerman across my feet sleep came quickly but hideous dreams assailed me there was a vision of a roman feast like that of trimalchio with a horror in a covered platter then came that damnable recurrent thing about the swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto yet when i awoke it was full daylight with normal sounds in the house below the rats living or spectral had not troubled me and niggerman was quietly asleep on going down i found that the same tranquillity had prevailed elsewhere a condition which one of the assembled savantsa fellow named thornton devoted to the psychicrather absurdly laid to the fact that i had now been shewn the thing which certain forces had wished to shew meall was now ready and at 11 am our entire group of seven men bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation went down to the subcellar and bolted the door behind us niggerman was with us for the investigators found no occasion to despise his excitability and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent manifestations we noted the roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs only briefly for three of the savants had already seen them and all knew their characteristics prime attention was paid to the momentous central altar and within an hour sir william brinton had caused it to tilt backward balanced by some unknown species of counterweightthere now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we not been prepared through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre was a ghastly array of human or semihuman bones those which retained their collocation as skeletons shewed attitudes of panic fear and over all were the marks of rodent gnawing the skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy cretinism or primitive semiapedom above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly chiselled from the solid rock and conducting a current of air this current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it we did not pause long but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps it was then that sir william examining the hewn walls made the odd observation that the passage according to the direction of the strokes must have been chiselledfrom beneathi must be very deliberate now and choose my wordsafter ploughing down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light ahead not any mystic phosphorescence but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that overlooked the waste valley that such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an aronaut could study its face in detail a few steps more and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw so literally that thornton the psychic investigator actually fainted in the arms of the dazed man who stood behind him norrys his plump face utterly white and flabby simply cried out inarticulately whilst i think that what i did was to gasp or hiss and cover my eyes the man behind methe only one of the party older than icroaked the hackneyed my god in the most cracked voice i ever heard of seven cultivated men only sir william brinton retained his composure a thing more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight firstit was a twilit grotto of enormous height stretching away farther than any eye could see a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion there were buildings and other architectural remainsin one terrified glance i saw a weird pattern of tumuli a savage circle of monoliths a lowdomed roman ruin a sprawling saxon pile and an early english edifice of woodbut all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground for yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones or bones at least as human as those on the steps like a foamy sea they stretched some fallen apart but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intentwhen dr trask the anthropologist stooped to classify the skulls he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him they were mostly lower than the piltdown man in the scale of evolution but in every case definitely human many were of higher grade and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types all the bones were gnawed mostly by rats but somewhat by others of the halfhuman drove mixed with them were many tiny bones of ratsfallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epici wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous day of discovery not hoffmann or huysmans could conceive a scene more wildly incredible more frenetically repellent or more gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered each stumbling on revelation after revelation and trying to keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken place there three hundred years or a thousand or two thousand or ten thousand years ago it was the antechamber of hell and poor thornton fainted again when trask told him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more generationshorror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains the quadruped thingswith their occasional recruits from the biped classhad been kept in stone pens out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or ratfear there had been great herds of them evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of huge stone bins older than rome i knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardenswould to heaven i could forget the purpose of the herds i did not have to asksir william standing with his searchlight in the roman ruin translated aloud the most shocking ritual i have ever known and told of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of cybele found and mingled with their own norrys used as he was to the trenches could not walk straight when he came out of the english building it was a butcher shop and kitchenhe had expected thatbut it was too much to see familiar english implements in such a place and to read familiar englishgraffitithere some as recent as 1610 i could not go in that buildingthat building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my ancestor walter de la poerwhat i did venture to enter was the low saxon building whose oaken door had fallen and there i found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars three had tenants all skeletons of high grade and on the bony forefinger of one i found a seal ring with my own coatofarms sir william found a vault with far older cells below the roman chapel but these cells were empty below them was a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved in latin greek and the tongue of phrygia meanwhile dr trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli and brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorillas and which bore indescribable ideographic carvings through all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed once i saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyeshaving grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit areaan area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dreamwe turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate we shall never know what sightless stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind but there was plenty to engross us close at hand for we had not gone far before the searchlights shewed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had feasted and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things and then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forgetgod those carrion black pits of sawed picked bones and opened skulls those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid celtic roman and english bones of countless unhallowed centuries some of them were full and none can say how deep they had once been others were still bottomless to our searchlights and peopled by unnamable fancies what i thought of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this grisly tartarusonce my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink and i had a moment of ecstatic fear i must have been musing a long time for i could not see any of the party but the plump capt norrys then there came a sound from that inky boundless farther distance that i thought i knew and i saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged egyptian god straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown but i was not far behind for there was no doubt after another second it was the eldritch scurrying of those fiendborn rats always questing for new horrors and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earths centre where nyarlathotep the mad faceless god howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot fluteplayersmy searchlight expired but still i ran i heard voices and yowls and echoes but above all there gently rose that impious insidious scurrying gently rising rising as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under endless onyx bridges to a black putrid sea something bumped into mesomething soft and plump it must have been the rats the viscous gelatinous ravenous army that feast on the dead and the living why shouldnt rats eat a de la poer as a de la poer eats forbidden things the war ate my boy damn them all and the yanks ate carfax with flames and burnt grandsire delapore and the secret no

after three hours found me crouching in the blackness over the plump halfeaten body of capt norrys with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat now they have blown up exham priory taken my niggerman away from me and shut me into this barred room at hanwell with fearful whispers about my heredity and experiences thornton is in the next room but they prevent me from talking to him they are trying too to suppress most of the facts concerning the priory when i speak of poor norrys they accuse me of a hideous thing but they must know that i did not do it they must know it was the rats the slithering scurrying rats whose scampering will never let me sleep the daemon rats that race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater horrors than i have ever known the rats they can never hear the rats the rats in the walls,1
the privilege of reminiscence however rambling or tiresome is one generally allowd to the very aged indeed tis frequently by means of such recollections that the obscure occurrences of history and the lesser anecdotes of the great are transmitted to posteritytho many of my readers have at times observd and remarkd a sort of antique flow in my stile of writing it hath pleased me to pass amongst the members of this generation as a young man giving out the fiction that i was born in 1890 inamericai am now however resolvd to unburthen myself of a secret which i have hitherto kept thro dread of incredulity and to impart to the publick a true knowledge of my long years in order to gratifie their taste for authentick information of an age with whose famous personages i was on familiar terms be it then known that i was born on the family estate indevonshireof the 10th day of august 1690 or in the newgregorianstile of reckoning the 20th of august being therefore now in my 228th year coming early tolondoni saw as a child many of the celebrated men of kingwilliamsreign including the lamented mrdrydenwho sat much at the tables ofwillscoffeehouse with mraddisonand drswifti later became very well acquainted and was an even more familiar friend to mrpopewhom i knew and respected till the day of his death but since it is of my more recent associate the late drjohnsonthat i am at this time desird to write i will pass over my youth for the presenti had first knowledge of the doctor in may of the year 1738 tho i did not at that time meet him mrpopehad just compleated his epilogue to hissatiresthe piece beginning not twice a twelvemonth you appear in print and had arrangd for its publication on the very day it appeard there was also publishd a satire in imitation ofjuvenalintituld london by the then unknownjohnsonand this so struck the town that many gentlemen of taste declared it was the work of a greater poet than mrpopenotwithstanding what some detractors have said of mrpopespetty jealousy he gave the verses of his new rival no small praise and having learnt thro mrrichardsonwho the poet was told me that mrjohnsonwoud soon bedeterri had no personal acquaintance with the doctor till 1763 when i was presented to him at themitretavern by mrjames boswella youngscotchmanof excellent family and great learning but small wit whose metrical effusions i had sometimes revisddrjohnsonas i beheld him was a full pursy man very ill drest and of slovenly aspect i recall him to have worn a bushy bobwig untyed and without powder and much too small for his head his cloaths were of rusty brown much wrinkled and with more than one button missing his face too full to be handsom was likewise marred by the effects of some scrofulous disorder and his head was continually rolling about in a sort of convulsive way of this infirmity indeed i had known before having heard of it from mrpopewho took the trouble to make particular inquiriesbeing nearly seventythree full nineteen years older than drjohnsoni say doctor tho his degree came not till two years afterward i naturally expected him to have some regard for my age and was therefore not in that fear of him which others confessd on my asking him what he thought of my favourable notice of his dictionary inthe londonermy periodical paper he said sir i possess no recollection of having perusd your paper and have not a great interest in the opinions of the less thoughtful part of mankind being more than a little piqued at the incivility of one whose celebrity made me solicitous of his approbation i venturd to retaliate in kind and told him i was surprisd that a man of sense shoud judge the thoughtfulness of one whose productions he admitted never having read why sir replydjohnsoni do not require to become familiar with a mans writings in order to estimate the superficiality of his attainments when he plainly shews it by his eagerness to mention his own productions in the first question he puts to me having thus become friends we conversd on many matters when to agree with him i said i was distrustful of the authenticity ofossianspoems mrjohnsonsaid that sir does not do your understanding particular credit for what all the town is sensible of is no great discovery for agrubstreetcritick to make you might as well say you have a strong suspicion thatmiltonwroteparadise losti thereafter

contrasts very favourably with some of the dissensions and disruptions i observe in the literary and amateur press associations of today this tranquillity was the more remarkable because we had amongst us gentlemen of very opposed opinions drjohnsonand i as well as many others were high tories whilst mrburkewas awhigand against theamericanwar many of his speeches on that subject having been widely publishd the least congenial member was one of the founders sirjohn hawkinswho hath since written many misrepresentations of our society sirjohnan eccentrick fellow once declind to pay his part of the reckoning for supper because twas his custom at home to eat no supper later he insulted mrburkein so intolerable a manner that we all took pains to shew our disapproval after which incident he came no more to our meetings however he never openly fell out with the doctor and was the executor of his will tho mrboswelland others have reason to question the genuineness of his attachment other

mrgarrickfor he never alluded to him as he did tofootewho was a very coarse fellow despite his comick genius mrgibbonwas none too well likd for he had an odious sneering way which offended even those of us who most admird his historical productions mrgoldsmitha little man very vain of his dress and very deficient in brilliancy of conversation was my particular favourite since i was equally unable to shine in the discourse he was vastly jealous of drjohnsontho none the less liking and respecting him i remember that once a foreigner agermani think was in our company and that whilstgoldsmithwas

his lasting hostility by crying hush toctorshonsoniss going to speakin this luminous company i was tolerated more because of my years than for my wit or learning being no match at all for the rest my

iafter twentytwo years of nightmare and terror saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions i am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which i think i found in western australia on the night of july 1718 1935 there is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucinationfor which indeed abundant causes existed and yet its realism was so hideous that i sometimes find hope impossible if the thing did happen then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos and of his own place in the seething vortex of time whose merest mention is paralysing he must too be placed on guard against a specific lurking peril which though it will never engulf the whole race may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it it is for this latter reason that i urge with all the force of my being a final abandonment of all attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigateassuming that i was sane and awake my experience on that night was such as has befallen no man before it was moreover a frightful confirmation of all i had sought to dismiss as myth and dream mercifully there is no proof for in my fright i lost the awesome object which wouldif real and brought out of that noxious abysshave formed irrefutable evidence when i came upon the horror i was aloneand i have up to now told no one about it i could not stop the others from digging in its direction but chance and the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it now i must formulate some definitive statementnot only for the sake of my own mental balance but to warn such others as may read it seriouslythese pagesmuch in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and scientific pressare written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home i shall give them to my son prof wingate peaslee of miskatonic universitythe only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case of all living persons he is least likely to ridicule what i shall tell of that fateful night i did not enlighten him orally before sailing because i think he had better have the revelation in written form reading and rereading at leisure will leave with him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey he can do as he thinks best with this accountshewing it with suitable comment to any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good it is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case that i am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its backgroundmy name is nathaniel wingate peaslee and those who recall the newspaper tales of a generation backor the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years agowill know who and what i am the press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in 190813 and much was made of the traditions of horror madness and witchcraft which lurk behind the ancient massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence yet i would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life this is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me fromoutsidesources it may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling whisperhaunted arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadowsthough even this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which i later came to study but the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal what came came fromsomewhere elsewhere i even now hesitate to assert in plain wordsi am the son of jonathan and hannah wingate peaslee both of wholesome old haverhill stock i was born and reared in haverhillat the old homestead in boardman street near golden hilland did not go to arkham till i entered miskatonic university at the age of eighteen that was in 1889 after my graduation i studied economics at harvard and came back to miskatonic as instructor of political economy in 1895 for thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily i married alice keezar of haverhill in 1896 and my three children robert k wingate and hannah were born in 1898 1900 and 1903 respectively in 1898 i became an associate professor and in 1902 a full professor at no time had i the least interest in either occultism or abnormal psychologyit was on thursday may 14 1908 that the queer amnesia came the thing was quite sudden though later i realised that certain brief glimmering visions of several hours previouschaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedentedmust have formed premonitory symptoms my head was aching and i had a singular feelingaltogether new to methat someone else was trying to get possession of my thoughtsthe collapse occurred about 1020 am while i was conducting a class in political economy vihistory and present tendencies of economicsfor juniors and a few sophomores i began to see strange shapes before my eyes and to feel that i was in a grotesque room other than the classroom my thoughts and speech wandered from my subject and the students saw that something was gravely amiss then i slumped down unconscious in my chair in a stupor from which no one could arouse me nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years four months and thirteen daysit is of course from others that i have learned what followed i shewed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours though removed to my home at 27 crane st and given the best of medical attention at 3 am may 15 my eyes opened and i began to speak but before long the doctors and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language it was clear that i had no remembrance of my identity or of my past though for some reason i seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge my eyes gazed strangely at the persons around me and the flexions of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliareven my speech seemed awkward and foreign i used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly and my diction had a curiously stilted quality as if i had laboriously learned the english language from books the pronunciation was barbarously alien whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast of the latter one in particular was very potentlyeven terrifiedlyrecalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward for at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currencyfirst in england and then in the united statesand though of much complexity and indisputable newness it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange arkham patient of 1908physical strength returned at once although i required an odd amount of reeducation in the use of my hands legs and bodily apparatus in general because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse i was for some time kept under strict medical care when i saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed i admitted it openly and became eager for information of all sorts indeed it seemed to the doctors that i had lost interest in my proper personality as soon as i found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing they noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history science art language and folkloresome of them tremendously abstruse and some childishly simplewhich remained very oddly in many cases outside my consciousnessat the same time they noticed that i had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledgea command which i seemed to wish to hide rather than display i would inadvertently refer with casual assurance to specific events in dim ages outside the range of accepted historypassing off such references as a jest when i saw the surprise they created and i had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright these uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them indeed i seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech customs and perspectives of the age around me as if i were a studious traveller from a far foreign landas soon as permitted i haunted the college library at all hours and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels and special courses at american and european universities which evoked so much comment during the next few years i did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period i was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personalityeven though i seemed to puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptom or some queer trace of carefully veiled mockeryof real friendliness however i encountered little something in my aspect and speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in everyone i met as if i were a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful this idea of a black hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort ofdistancewas oddly widespread and persistent my own family formed no exception from the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing vowing that i was some utter alien usurping the body of her husband in 1910 she obtained a legal divorce nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normalcy in 1913 these feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter neither of whom i have ever seen sinceonly my second son wingate seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my change aroused he indeed felt that i was a stranger but though only eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return when it did return he sought me out and the courts gave me his custody in succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which i was driven and today at thirtyfive he is a professor of psychology at miskatonic but i do not wonder at the horror i causedfor certainly the mind voice and facial expression of the being that awaked on may 15 1908 were not those of nathaniel wingate peasleei will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913 since readers may glean all the outward essentialsas i largely had to dofrom files of old newspapers and scientific journals i was given charge of my funds and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely in travel and in study at various centres of learning my travels however were singular in the extreme involving long visits to remote and desolate places in 1909 i spent a month in the himalayas and in 1911 aroused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of arabia what happened on those journeys i have never been able to learn during the summer of 1912 i chartered a ship and sailed in the arctic north of spitzbergen afterward shewing signs of disappointment later in that year i spent weeks alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western virginiablack labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be consideredmy sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own i have found also that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal i could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as i could turn the leaves while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome at times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others though i seemed to have taken care to minimise displays of this facultyother ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups and scholars suspected of connexion with nameless bands of abhorrent elderworld hierophants these rumours though never proved at the time were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my readingfor the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly there is tangible proofin the form of marginal notesthat i went minutely through such things as the comte derlettescultes des goulesludvig prinnsde vermis mysteriistheunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt the surviving fragments of the puzzlingbook of eibonand the dreadednecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred then too it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutationin the summer of 1913 i began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me i spoke of returning memories of my earlier lifethough most auditors judged me insincere since all the recollections i gave were casual and such as might have been learned from my old private papers about the middle of august i returned to arkham and reopened my longclosed house in crane st here i installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in europe and america and guarded carefully from the sight of anyone intelligent enough to analyse it those who did see ita workman a servant and the new housekeepersay that it was a queer mixture of rods wheels and mirrors though only about two feet tall one foot wide and one foot thick the central mirror was circular and convex all this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be locatedon the evening of friday sept 26 i dismissed the housekeeper and the maid till noon of the next day lights burned in the house till late and a lean dark curiously foreignlooking man called in an automobile it was about 1 am that the lights were last seen at 215 am a policeman observed the place in darkness but with the strangers motor still at the curb by four oclock the motor was certainly gone it was at six that a hesitant foreign voice on the telephone asked dr wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint this calla longdistance onewas later traced to a public booth in the north station in boston but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthedwhen the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sittingroomin an easychair with a table drawn up before it on the polished tabletop were scratches shewing where some heavy object had rested the queer machine was gone nor was anything afterward heard of it undoubtedly the dark lean foreigner had taken it away in the library grate were abundant ashes evidently left from the burning of every remaining scrap of paper on which i had written since the advent of the amnesia dr wilson found my breathing very peculiar but after an hypodermic injection it became more regularat 1115 am sept 27 i stirred vigorously and my hitherto masklike face began to shew signs of expression dr wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary personality but seemed much like that of my normal self about 1130 i muttered some very curious syllablessyllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech i appeared too to struggle against something then just after noonthe housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returnedi began to mutter in english of the orthodox economists of that period jevons typifies the prevailing trend toward scientific correlation his attempt to link the commercial cycle of prosperity and depression with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms perhaps the apex of nathaniel wingate peaslee had come backa spirit in whose timescale it was still that thursday morning in 1908 with the economics class gazing up at the battered desk on the platformiimy reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process the loss of over five years creates more complications than can be imagined and in my case there were countless matters to be adjusted what i heard of my actions since 1908 astonished and disturbed me but i tried to view the matter as philosophically as i could at last regaining custody of my second son wingate i settled down with him in the crane street house and endeavoured to resume teachingmy old professorship having been kindly offered me by the collegei began work with the february 1914 term and kept at it just a year by that time i realised how badly my experience had shaken me though perfectly sanei hopedand with no flaw in my original personality i had not the nervous energy of the old days vague dreams and queer ideas continually haunted me and when the outbreak of the world war turned my mind to history i found myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion my conception oftimemy ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and simultaneousnessseemed subtly disordered so that i formed chimerical notions about living in one age and casting ones mind all over eternity for knowledge of past and future agesthe war gave me strange impressions ofrememberingsome of its faroffconsequencesas if i knew how it was coming out and could lookbackupon it in the light of future information all such quasimemories were attended with much pain and with a feeling that some artificial psychological barrier was set against them when i diffidently hinted to others about my impressions i met with varied responses some persons looked uncomfortably at me but men in the mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of relativitythen discussed only in learned circleswhich were later to become so famous dr albert einstein they said was rapidly reducingtimeto the status of a mere dimensionbut the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me so that i had to drop my regular work in 1915 certain of the impressions were taking an annoying shapegiving me the persistent notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort ofexchangethat the secondary personality had indeed been an intruding force from unknown regions and that my own personality had suffered displacement thus i was driven to vague and frightful speculations concerning the whereabouts of my true self during the years that another had held my body the curious knowledge and strange conduct of my bodys late tenant troubled me more and more as i learned further details from persons papers and magazines queernesses that had baffled others seemed to harmonise terribly with some background of black knowledge which festered in the chasms of my subconscious i began to search feverishly for every scrap of information bearing on the studies and travels ofthat other oneduring the dark yearsnot all of my troubles were as semiabstract as this there were the dreamsand these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness knowing how most would regard them i seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists but eventually i commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or nontypical such visions might be among amnesia victims my results aided by psychologists historians anthropologists and mental specialists of wide experience and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of daemoniacpossession legends to the medically realistic present at first bothered me more than they consoled mei soon found that my dreams had indeed no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases there remained however a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience some of them were bits of ancient folklore others were casehistories in the annals of medicine one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories it thus appeared that while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of mans annals some centuries might contain one two or three cases others noneor at least none whose record survivedthe essence was always the samea person of keen thoughtfulness seized with a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific historic artistic and anthropological knowledge an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power then a sudden return of the rightful consciousness intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out and the close resemblance of those nightmares to my owneven in some of the smallest particularsleft no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature one or two of the cases had an added ring of faint blasphemous familiarity as if i had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate in three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second changeanother thing that cloudily worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with welldefined amnesia these persons were largely of mediocre mind or lesssome so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions for a second they would be fired with alien forcethen a backward lapse and a thin swiftfading memory of unhuman horrorsthere had been at least three such cases during the past half centuryone only fifteen years before had something beengroping blindly through timefrom some unsuspected abyss in nature were these faint cases monstrous sinisterexperimentsof a kind and authorship utterly beyond sane belief such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker hoursfancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered for i could not doubt but that certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity apparently unknown to the victims and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases formed a striking and awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mineof the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous i still almost fear to speak they seemed to savour of madness and at times i believed i was indeed going mad was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of memory conceivably the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudomemories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries this indeed though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered they did not call the condition true insanity but classed it rather among neurotic disorders my course in trying to track it down and analyse it instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles i especially valued the advice of such physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personalitymy first disturbances were not visual at all but concerned the more abstract matters which i have mentioned there was too a feeling of profound and inexplicable horror concerningmyselfi developed a queer fear of seeing my own form as if my eyes would find it something utterly alien and inconceivably abhorrent when i did glance down and behold the familiar human shape in quiet grey or blue clothing i always felt a curious relief though in order to gain this relief i had to conquer an infinite dread i shunned mirrors as much as possible and was always shaved at the barbersit was a long time before i correlated any of these disjointed feelings with the fleeting visual impressions which began to develop the first such correlation had to do with the odd sensation of an external artificial restraint on my memory i felt that the snatches of sight i experienced had a profound and terrible meaning and a frightful connexion with myself but that some purposeful influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion then came that queerness about the element oftimeand with it desperate efforts to place the fragmentary dreamglimpses in the chronological and spatial patternthe glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible i would seem to be in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groinings were wellnigh lost in the shadows overhead in whatever time or place the scene might be the principle of the arch was known as fully and used as extensively as by the romans there were colossal round windows and high arched doors and pedestals or tables each as tall as the height of an ordinary room vast shelves of dark wood lined the walls holding what seemed to be volumes of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their backs the exposed stonework held curious carvings always in curvilinear mathematical designs and there were chiselled inscriptions in the same characters that the huge books bore the dark granite masonry was of a monstrous megalithic type with lines of convextopped blocks fitting the concavebottomed courses which rested upon them there were no chairs but the tops of the vast pedestals were littered with books papers and what seemed to be writing materialsoddly figured jars of a purplish metal and rods with stained tips tall as the pedestals were i seemed at times able to view them from above on some of them were great globes of luminous crystal serving as lamps and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous tubes and metal rods the windows were glazed and latticed with stoutlooking bars though i dared not approach and peer out them i could see from where i was the waving tops of singular fernlike growths the floor was of massive octagonal flagstones while rugs and hangings were entirely lackinglater i had visions of sweeping through cyclopean corridors of stone and up and down gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry there were no stairs anywhere nor was any passageway less than thirty feet wide some of the structures through which i floated must have towered into the sky for thousands of feet there were multiple levels of black vaults below and neveropened trapdoors sealed down with metal bands and holding dim suggestions of some special peril i seemed to be a prisoner and horror hung broodingly over everything i saw i felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my soul with their message were i not guarded by a merciful ignorancestill later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows and from the titanic flat roof with its curious gardens wide barren area and high scalloped parapet of stone to which the topmost of the inclined planes led there were almost endless leagues of giant buildings each in its garden and ranged along paved roads fully two hundred feet wide they differed greatly in aspect but few were less than five hundred feet square or a thousand feet high many seemed so limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet while some shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey steamy heavens they seemed to be mainly of stone or concrete and most of them embodied the oddly curvilinear type of masonry noticeable in the building that held me roofs were flat and gardencovered and tended to have scalloped parapets sometimes there were terraces and higher levels and wide cleared spaces amidst the gardens the great roads held hints of motion but in the earlier visions i could not resolve this impression into detailsin certain places i beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far above any of the other structures these appeared to be of a totally unique nature and shewed signs of prodigious age and dilapidation they were built of a bizarre type of squarecut basalt masonry and tapered slightly toward their rounded tops nowhere in any of them could the least traces of windows or other apertures save huge doors be found i noticed also some lower buildingsall crumbling with the weathering of aeonswhich resembled these dark cylindrical towers in basic architecture around all these aberrant piles of squarecut masonry there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear like that bred by the sealed trapdoorsthe omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness with bizarre and unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with curiously carven monoliths abnormally vast fernlike growths predominated some green and some of a ghastly fungoid pallor among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites whose bamboolike trunks towered to fabulous heights then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads and grotesque darkgreen shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect flowers were small colourless and unrecognisable blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery in a few of the terrace and rooftop gardens were larger and more vivid blossoms of almost offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding fungi of inconceivable size outlines and colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but wellestablished horticultural tradition in the larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt to preserve the irregularities of nature but on the roofs there was more selectiveness and more evidences of the topiary artthe skies were almost always moist and cloudy and sometimes i would seem to witness tremendous rains once in a while though there would be glimpses of the sunwhich looked abnormally largeand of the moon whose markings held a touch of difference from the normal that i could never quite fathom whenvery rarelythe night sky was clear to any extent i beheld constellations which were nearly beyond recognition known outlines were sometimes approximated but seldom duplicated and from the position of the few groups i could recognise i felt i must be in the earths southern hemisphere near the tropic of capricorn the far horizon was always steamy and indistinct but i could see that great jungles of unknown treeferns calamites lepidodendra and sigillaria lay outside the city their fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours now and then there would be suggestions of motion in the sky but these my early visions never resolvedby the autumn of 1914 i began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings over the city and through the regions around it i saw interminable roads through forests of fearsome growths with mottled fluted and banded trunks and past other cities as strange as the one which persistently haunted me i saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent stone in glades and clearings where perpetual twilight reigned and traversed long causeways over swamps so dark that i could tell but little of their moist towering vegetation once i saw an area of countless miles strown with ageblasted basaltic ruins whose architecture had been like that of the few windowless roundtopped towers in the haunting city and once i saw the seaa boundless steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone piers of an enormous town of domes and arches great shapeless suggestions of shadow moved over it and here and there its surface was vexed with anomalous spoutingsiiias i have said it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their terrifying quality certainly many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger thingsthings compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life pictures and reading and arranged in fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of sleep for some time i accepted the visions as natural even though i had never before been an extravagant dreamer many of the vague anomalies i argued must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down while others seemed to reflect a common textbook knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years agothe world of the permian or triassic age in the course of some months however the element of terror did figure with accumulating force this was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the aspect ofmemoriesand when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract disturbancesthe feeling of mnemonic restraint the curious impressions regardingtimethe sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of 190813 and considerably later the inexplicable loathing of my own personas certain definite details began to enter the dreams their horror increased a thousandfolduntil by october 1915 i felt i must do something it was then that i began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions feeling that i might thereby objectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip however as before mentioned the result was at first almost exactly opposite it disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological knowledgeand therefore of any idea of primitive landscapeson the subjects part what is more many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardensand other things the actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savoured of madness and blasphemy worst of all my own pseudomemory was aroused to wilder dreams and hints of coming revelations and yet most doctors deemed my course on the whole an advisable onei studied psychology systematically and under the prevailing stimulus my son wingate did the samehis studies leading eventually to his present professorship in 1917 and 1918 i took special courses at miskatonic meanwhile my examination of medical historical and anthropological records became indefatigable involving travels to distant libraries and finally including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary personality had been so disturbingly interested some of the latter were the actual copies i had consulted in my altered state and i was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations and ostensiblecorrectionsof the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed oddly unhumanthese markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books all of which the writer seemed to know with equal though obviously academic facility one note appended to von junztsunaussprechlichen kultenhowever was alarmingly otherwise it consisted of certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the same ink as that of the german corrections but following no recognised human pattern and these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably akin to the characters constantly met with in my dreamscharacters whose meaning i would sometimes momentarily fancy i knew or was just on the brink of recalling to complete my black confusion my librarians assured me that in view of previous examinations and records of consultation of the volumes in question all of these notations must have been made by myself in my secondary state this despite the fact that i was and still am ignorant of three of the languages involvedpiecing together the scattered records ancient and modern anthropological and medical i found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose scope and wildness left me utterly dazed only one thing consoled methe fact that the myths were of such early existence what lost knowledge could have brought pictures of the palaeozoic or mesozoic landscape into these primitive fables i could not even guess but the pictures had been there thus a basis existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion cases of amnesia no doubt created the general mythpatternbut afterward the fanciful accretions of the myths must have reacted on amnesia sufferers and coloured their pseudomemories i myself had read and heard all the early tales during my memory lapsemy quest had amply proved that was it not natural then for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state a few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the prehuman world especially those hindoo tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of modern theosophistsprimal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only oneperhaps the leastof the highly evolved and dominant races of this planets long and largely unknown career things of inconceivable shape they implied had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea three hundred million years ago some had come down from the stars a few were as old as the cosmos itself others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our lifecycle as those germs are behind ourselves spans of thousands of millions of years and linkages with other galaxies and universes were freely spoken of indeed there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sensebut most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race of a queer and intricate shape resembling no lifeform known to science which had lived till only fifty million years before the advent of man this they indicated was the greatest race of all because it alone had conquered the secret of time it had learned all things that ever were knownor ever would be knownon the earth through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future even through gulfs of millions of years and study the lore of every age from the accomplishments of this race arose all legends ofprophetsincluding those in human mythologyin its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earths annalshistories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be with full records of their arts their achievements their languages and their psychologies with this aeonembracing knowledge the great race chose from every era and lifeform such thoughts arts and processes as might suit its own nature and situation knowledge of the past secured through a kind of mindcasting outside the recognised senses was harder to glean than knowledge of the futurein the latter case the course was easier and more material with suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time feeling its dim extrasensory way till it approached the desired period then after preliminary trials it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that periods lifeforms entering the organisms brain and setting up therein its own vibrations while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer remaining in the latters body till a reverse process was set up the projected mind in the body of the organism of the future would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniquesmeanwhile the displaced mind thrown back to the displacers age and body would be carefully guarded it would be kept from harming the body it occupied and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners often it could be questioned in its own language when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language if the mind came from a body whose language the great race could not physically reproduce clever machines would be made on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument the great races members were immense rugose cones ten feet high and with head and other organs attached to footthick distensible limbs spreading from the apexes they spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast tenfoot baseswhen the captive minds amazement and resentment had worn off and when assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the great races it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer with suitable precautions and in exchange for suitable services it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boatlike atomicengined vehicles which traversed the great roads and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planets past and future this reconciled many captive minds to their lot since none were other than keen and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earthclosed chapters of inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural agesforms always despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled the supreme experience of lifenow and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the futureto exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages and all were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their respective periods such documents to be filed in the great central archivesit may be added that there was one sad special type of captive whose privileges were far greater than those of the majority these were the dyingpermanentexiles whose bodies in the future had been seized by keenminded members of the great race who faced with death sought to escape mental extinction such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected since the longevity of the great race lessened its love of lifeespecially among those superior minds capable of projection from cases of the permanent projection of elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later historyincluding mankindsas for the ordinary cases of explorationwhen the displacing mind had learned what it wished in the future it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and reverse the process of projection once more it would be in its own body in its own age while the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible in such cases of course the exploring mind hadlike those of the deathescapersto live out an alienbodied life in the future or else the captive mindlike the dying permanent exileshad to end its days in the form and past age of the great racethis fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the great racea not infrequent occurrence since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own future the number of dying permanent exiles of the great race was very slightlargely because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future great race minds by the moribund through projection arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the offending minds in their new future bodiesand sometimes forced reexchanges were effected complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified in every age since the discovery of mindprojection a minute but wellrecognised element of the population consisted of great race minds from past ages sojourning for a longer or shorter whilewhen a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the great races agethis because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities the few existing instances of clear transmission had caused and would cause at known future times great disasters and it was largely in consequence of two cases of the kind said the old myths that mankind had learned what it had concerning the great race of all things survivingphysically and directlyfrom that aeondistant world there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea and parts of the text of the frightful pnakotic manuscriptsthus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure all memories that could be eradicated were eradicated so that in most cases only a dreamshadowed blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange some minds recalled more than others and the chance joining of memories had at rare times brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages there probably never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish certain of these hints in thenecronomiconthe presence of such a cult among human beings was suggesteda cult that sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging down the aeons from the days of the great raceand meanwhile the great race itself waxed wellnigh omniscient and turned to the task of setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets and of exploring their pasts and futures it sought likewise to fathom the past years and origin of that black aeondead orb in far space whence its own mental heritage had comefor the mind of the great race was older than its bodily form the beings of a dying elder world wise with the ultimate secrets had looked ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life and had sent their minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house themthe coneshaped things that peopled our earth a billion years ago thus the great race came to be while the myriad minds sent backward were left to die in the horror of strange shapes later the race would again face death yet would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the bodies of others who had a longer physical span ahead of themsuch was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination when around 1920 i had my researches in coherent shape i felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased after all and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions were not most of my phenomena readily explainable any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesiaand then i read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and illregarded cults that plainly supplied the material for the dreams and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory as for the marginal notes in dreamhieroglyphs and languages unknown to me but laid at my door by librariansi might easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state while the hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends andafterwardwoven into my dreams i tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cultleaders but never succeeded in establishing the right connexionsat times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it had at first but on the other hand i reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales i had learned only when in my secondary state when these victims had lost their memory they had associated themselves with the creatures of their household mythsthe fabulous invaders supposed to displace mens mindsand had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they could take back to a fancied nonhuman past then when their memory returned they reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers hence the dreams and pseudomemories following the conventional mythpatterndespite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations they came finally to supersede all others in my mindlargely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory and a substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me the more i reflected the more convincing did my reasoning seem till in the end i had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me suppose i did see strange things at night these were only what i had heard and read of suppose i did have odd loathings and perspectives and pseudomemories these too were only echoes of myths absorbed in my secondary state nothing that i might dream nothing that i might feel could be of any actual significancefortified by this philosophy i greatly improved in nervous equilibrium even though the visions rather than the abstract impressions steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed in 1922 i felt able to undertake regular work again and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university my old chair of political economy had long been adequately filledbesides which methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday my son was at this time just entering on the postgraduate studies leading to his present professorship and we worked together a great dealivi continued however to keep a careful record of the outr dreams which crowded upon me so thickly and vividly such a record i argued was of genuine value as a psychological document the glimpses still seemed damnably likememoriesthough i fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success in writing i treated the phantasmata as things seen but at all other times i brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night i had never mentioned such matters in common conversation though reports of them filtering out as such things will had aroused sundry rumours regarding my mental health it is amusing to reflect that these rumours were confined wholly to laymen without a single champion among physicians or psychologistsof my visions after 1914 i will here mention only a few since fuller accounts and records are at the disposal of the serious student it is evident that with time the curious inhibitions somewhat waned for the scope of my visions vastly increased they have never though become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation within the dreams i seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering i floated through many strange buildings of stone going from one to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit sometimes i encountered those gigantic sealed trapdoors in the lowest level around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness clung i saw tremendous tessellated pools and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me and whosesoundmanifested itself only after many years of dreaming i may here remark that sight and sound are the only senses i have ever exercised in the visionary worldthe real horror began in may 1915 when i first saw theliving thingsthis was before my studies had taught me what in view of the myths and case histories to expect as mental barriers wore down i beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and in the streets below these steadily grew more solid and distinct till at last i could trace their monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease they seemed to be enormous iridescent cones about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base and made up of some ridgy scaly semielastic matter from their apexes projected four flexible cylindrical members each a foot thick and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves these members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing and sometimes extended to any distance up to about ten feet terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers at the end of a third were four red trumpetlike appendages the fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central circumference surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flowerlike appendages whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles the great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery grey substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contractiontheir actions though harmless horrified me even more than their appearancefor it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one has known only human beings to do these objects moved intelligently around the great rooms getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables or vice versa and sometimes writing diligently with a penlike rod gripped in the greenish headtentacles the huge nippers were used in carrying books and in conversationspeech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping the objects had no clothing but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk they commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top although it was frequently raised or lowered the other three great members tended to rest downward on the sides of the cone contracted to about five feet each when not in use from their rate of reading writing and operating their machines those on the tables seemed somehow connected with thought i concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than mansafterward i saw them everywhere swarming in all the great chambers and corridors tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts and racing along the vast roads in gigantic boatshaped cars i ceased to be afraid of them for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment individual differences amongst them began to be manifest and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint these latter though shewing no physical variation had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority but very largely from one another they wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of charactersnever the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority a few i fancied used our own familiar alphabet most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entitiesall this timemy own partin the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal floating freely about yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel not until august 1915 did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me i sayharassbecause the first phase was a purely abstract though infinitely terrible association of my previously noted bodyloathing with the scenes of my visions for a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself and i recall how grateful i was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms i was mightily troubled by the fact that i always saw the great tableswhose height could not be under ten feetfrom a level not below that of their surfacesand then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater till one night i could not resist it at first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever a moment later i perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply i saw the scaly rugose iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base that was when i waked half of arkham with my screaming as i plunged madly up from the abyss of sleeponly after weeks of hideous repetition did i grow halfreconciled to these visions of myself in monstrous form in the dreams i now moved bodily among the other unknown entities reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head snatches of what i read and wrote would linger in my memory there were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes there were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts and frightful chronicles of grotesquebodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being and i learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has ever suspected most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs which i studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines and which was evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human languages other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way a very few were in languages i knew extremely clever pictures both inserted in the records and forming separate collections aided me immensely and all the time i seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in english on waking i could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my dreamself had mastered though whole phrases of the history stayed with mei learnedeven before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old myths from which the dreams doubtless sprangthat the entities around me were of the worlds greatest race which had conquered time and had sent exploring minds into every age i knew too that i had been snatched from my age whileanotherused my body in that age and that a few of the other strange forms housed similarly captured minds i seemed to talk in some odd language of clawclickings with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar systemthere was a mind from the planet we know as venus which would live incalculable epochs to come and one from an outer moon of jupiter six million years in the past of earthly minds there were some from the winged starheaded halfvegetable race of palaeogean antarctica one from the reptile people of fabled valusia three from the furry prehuman hyperborean worshippers of tsathoggua one from the wholly abominable tchotchos two from the arachnid denizens of earths last age five from the hardy coleopterous species immediately following mankind to which the great race was some day to transfer its keenest minds en masse in the face of horrible peril and several from different branches of humanityi talked with the mind of yiangli a philosopher from the cruel empire of tsanchan which is to come in ad 5000 with that of a general of the greatheaded brown people who held south africa in bc 50000 with that of a twelfthcentury florentine monk named bartolomeo corsi with that of a king of lomar who had ruled that terrible polar land 100000 years before the squat yellow inutos came from the west to engulf it with that of nugsoth a magician of the dark conquerors of ad 16000 with that of a roman named titus sempronius blaesus who had been a quaestor in sullas time with that of khephnes an egyptian of the 14th dynasty who told me the hideous secret of nyarlathotep with that of a priest of atlantis middle kingdom with that of a suffolk gentleman of cromwells day james woodville with that of a court astronomer of preinca peru with that of the australian physicist nevil kingstonbrown who will die in ad 2518 with that of an archimage of vanished yhe in the pacific with that of theodotides a graecobactrian official of bc 200 with that of an aged frenchman of louis xiiis time named pierrelouis montmagny with that of cromya a cimmerian chieftain of bc 15000 and with so many others that my brain cannot hold the shocking secrets and dizzying marvels i learned from themi awaked each morning in a fever sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects and i marvelled at the dreamfancy which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science i shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth what was hinted in the speech of posthuman entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that i will not set it down here after man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation the bodies of whose members the cream of the great race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the elder world later as the earths span closed the transferred minds would again migrate through time and spaceto another stoppingplace in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of mercury but there would be races after them clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horrorfilled core before the utter endmeanwhile in my dreams i wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which i was preparinghalf voluntarily and half through promises of increased library and travel opportunitiesfor the great races central archives the archives were in a colossal subterranean structure near the citys centre which i came to know well through frequent labours and consultations meant to last as long as the race and to withstand the fiercest of earths convulsions this titan repository surpassed all other buildings in the massive mountainlike firmness of its constructionthe records written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric were bound into books that opened from the top and were kept in individual cases of a strange extremely light rustless metal of greyish hue decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the great races curvilinear hieroglyphs these cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaultslike closed locked shelveswrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate turnings my own history was assigned a specific place in the vaults of the lowest or vertebrate levelthe section devoted to the culture of mankind and of the furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominancebut none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life all were the merest misty disconnected fragments and it is certain that these fragments were not unfolded in their rightful sequence i have for example a very imperfect idea of my own living arrangements in the dreamworld though i seem to have possessed a great stone room of my own my restrictions as a prisoner gradually disappeared so that some of the visions included vivid travels over the mighty jungle roads sojourns in strange cities and explorations of some of the vast dark windowless ruins from which the great race shrank in curious fear there were also long seavoyages in enormous manydecked boats of incredible swiftness and trips over wild regions in closed projectilelike airships lifted and moved by electrical repulsion beyond the wide warm ocean were other cities of the great race and on one far continent i saw the crude villages of the blacksnouted winged creatures who would evolve as a dominant stock after the great race had sent its foremost minds into the future to escape the creeping horror flatness and exuberant green life were always the keynote of the scene hills were low and sparse and usually displayed signs of volcanic forcesof the animals i saw i could write volumes all were wild for the great races mechanised culture had long since done away with domestic beasts while food was wholly vegetable or synthetic clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in steaming morasses fluttered in the heavy air or spouted in the seas and lakes and among these i fancied i could vaguely recognise lesser archaic prototypes of many formsdinosaurs pterodactyls ichthyosaurs labyrinthodonts rhamphorhynci plesiosaurs and the likemade familiar through palaeontology of birds or mammals there were none that i could discernthe ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes lizards and crocodiles while insects buzzed incessantly amidst the lush vegetation and far out at sea unspied and unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of foam into the vaporous sky once i was taken under the ocean in a gigantic submarine vessel with searchlights and glimpsed some living horrors of awesome magnitude i saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities and the wealth of crinoid brachiopod coral and ichthyic life which everywhere aboundedof the physiology psychology folkways and detailed history of the great race my visions preserved but little information and many of the scattered points i here set down were gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather than from my own dreaming for in time of course my reading and research caught up with and passed the dreams in many phases so that certain dreamfragments were explained in advance and formed verifications of what i had learned this consolingly established my belief that similar reading and research accomplished by my secondary self had formed the source of the whole terrible fabric of pseudomemoriesthe period of my dreams apparently was one somewhat less than 150000000 years ago when the palaeozoic age was giving place to the mesozoic the bodies occupied by the great race represented no survivingor even scientifically knownline of terrestrial evolution but were of a peculiar closely homogeneous and highly specialised organic type inclining as much to the vegetable as to the animal state cellaction was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue and wholly eliminating the need of sleep nourishment assimilated through the red trumpetlike appendages on one of the great flexible limbs was always semifluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals the beings had but two of the senses which we recognisesight and hearing the latter accomplished through the flowerlike appendages on the grey stalks above their headsbut of other and incomprehensible senses not however well utilisable by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies they possessed many their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal their blood was a sort of deepgreenish ichor of great thickness they had no sex but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and could be developed only under water great shallow tanks were used for the growth of their youngwhich were however reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of individuals four or five thousand years being the common life spanmarkedly defective individuals were quietly disposed of as soon as their defects were noticed disease and the approach of death were in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical pain recognised by purely visual symptoms the dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies once in a while as before mentioned a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time but such cases were not numerous when one did occur the exiled mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar tenementthe great race seemed to form a single loosely knit nation or league with major institutions in common though there were four definite divisions the political and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism with major resources rationally distributed and power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests family organisation was not overstressed though ties among persons of common descent were recognised and the young were generally reared by their parentsresemblances to human attitudes and institutions were of course most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic unspecialised urges common to all organic life a few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the great race probed the future and copied what it liked industry highly mechanised demanded but little time from each citizen and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts the sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development and art was a vital part of life though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal dayscrime was surprisingly scanty and was dealt with through highly efficient policing punishments ranged from privilegedeprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotionwrenching and were never administered without a careful study of the criminals motivations warfare largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian and octopodic invaders or against the winged starheaded old ones who centred in the antarctic was infrequent though infinitely devastating an enormous army using cameralike weapons which produced tremendous electrical effects was kept on hand for purposes seldom mentioned but obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark windowless elder ruins and of the great sealed trapdoors in the lowest subterrene levelsthis fear of the basalt ruins and trapdoors was largely a matter of unspoken suggestionor at most of furtive quasiwhispers everything specific which bore on it was significantly absent from such books as were on the common shelves it was the one subject lying altogether under a taboo among the great race and seemed to be connected alike with horrible bygone struggles and with that future peril which would some day force the race to send its keener minds ahead en masse in time imperfect and fragmentary as were the other things presented by dreams and legends this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded the vague old myths avoided itor perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised and in the dreams of myself and others the hints were peculiarly few members of the great race never intentionally referred to the matter and what could be gleaned came only from some of the more sharply observant captive mindsaccording to these scraps of information the basis of the fear was a horrible elder race of halfpolypous utterly alien entities which had come through space from immeasurably distant universes and had dominated the earth and three other solar planets about six hundred million years ago they were only partly materialas we understand matterand their type of consciousness and media of perception differed wholly from those of terrestrial organisms for example their senses did not include that of sight their mental world being a strange nonvisual pattern of impressions they were however sufficiently material to use implements of normal matter when in cosmic areas containing it and they required housingalbeit of a peculiar kind though theirsensescould penetrate all material barriers theirsubstancecould not and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy them they had the power of arial motion despite the absence of wings or any other visible means of levitation their minds were of such texture that no exchange with them could be effected by the great racewhen these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found thus it was when the minds of the great race sped across the void from that obscure transgalactic world known in the disturbing and debatable eltdown shards as yith the newcomers with the instruments they created had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference boldness or scientific and historical zealbut as the aeons passed there came vague evil signs that the elder things were growing strong and numerous in the inner world there were sporadic irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the great race and in some of the deserted elder cities which the great race had not peopledplaces where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded after that greater precautions were taken and many of the paths were closed for everthough a few were left with sealed trapdoors for strategic use in fighting the elder things if ever they broke forth in unexpected places fresh rifts caused by that selfsame geologic change which had choked some of the paths and had slowly lessened the number of outerworld structures and ruins surviving from the conquered entitiesthe irruptions of the elder things must have been shocking beyond all description since they had permanently coloured the psychology of the great race such was the fixed mood of horror that the veryaspectof the creatures was left unmentionedat no time was i able to gain a clear hint of what they looked like there were veiled suggestions of a monstrousplasticityand of temporarylapses of visibilitywhile other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and military use ofgreat windssingularwhistlingnoises and colossal footprints made up of five circular toemarks seemed also to be associated with themit was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the great racethe doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the safer futurehad to do with a final successful irruption of the elder beings mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror and the great race had resolved that none who could escape should face it that the foray would be a matter of vengeance rather than an attempt to reoccupy the outer world they knew from the planets later historyfor their projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous entities perhaps these entities had come to prefer earths inner abysses to the variable stormravaged surface since light meant nothing to them perhaps too they were slowly weakening with the aeons indeed it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of the posthuman beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant meanwhile the great race maintained its cautious vigilance with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records and always the shadow of nameless fear hung about the sealed trapdoors and the dark windowless elder towersvthat is the world of which my dreams brought me dim scattered echoes every night i cannot hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes for it was upon a wholly intangible qualitythe sharp sense ofpseudomemorythat such feelings mainly depended as i have said my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings in the form of rational psychological explanations and this saving influence was augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time yet in spite of everything the vague creeping terror would return momentarily now and then it did not however engulf me as it had before and after 1922 i lived a very normal life of work and recreationin the course of years i began to feel that my experiencetogether with the kindred cases and the related folkloreought to be definitely summarised and published for the benefit of serious students hence i prepared a series of articles briefly covering the whole ground and illustrated with crude sketches of some of the shapes scenes decorative motifs and hieroglyphs remembered from the dreams these appeared at various times during 1928 and 1929 in thejournal of the american psychological societybut did not attract much attention meanwhile i continued to record my dreams with the minutest care even though the growing stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportionson july 10 1934 there was forwarded to me by the psychological society the letter which opened the culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal it was postmarked pilbarra western australia and bore the signature of one whom i found upon inquiry to be a mining engineer of considerable prominence enclosed were some very curious snapshots i will reproduce the text in its entirety and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an effect it and the photographs had upon mei was for a time almost stunned and incredulous for although i had often thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams i was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination most devastating of all were the photographsfor here in cold incontrovertible realism there stood out against a background of sand certain worndown waterridged stormweathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly concave bottoms told their own story and when i studied them with a magnifying glass i could see all too plainly amidst the batterings and pittings the traces of those vast curvilinear designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me but here is the letter which speaks for itself49 dampier strpilbarra w australia18 may 1934prof n w peasleeco am psychological society30 e 41st strn y city usamy dear sira recent conversation with dr e m boyle of perth and some papers with your articles which he has just sent me make it advisable for me to tell you about certain things i have seen in the great sandy desert east of our gold field here it would seem in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge stonework and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe that i have come upon something very importantthe blackfellows have always been full of talk about great stones with marks on them and seem to have a terrible fear of such things they connect them in some way with their common racial legends about buddai the gigantic old man who lies asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm and who will some day awake and eat up the world there are some very old and halfforgotten tales of enormous underground huts of great stones where passages lead down and down and where horrible things have happened the blackfellows claim that once some warriors fleeing in battle went down into one and never came back but that frightful winds began to blow from the place soon after they went down however there usually isnt much in what these natives saybut what i have to tell is more than this two years ago when i was prospecting about 500 miles east in the desert i came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone perhaps 3 2 2 feet in size and weathered and pitted to the very limit at first i couldnt find any of the marks the blackfellows told about but when i looked close enough i could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering they were peculiar curves just like what the blacks had tried to describe i imagine there must have been 30 or 40 blocks some nearly buried in the sand and all within a circle perhaps a quarter of a miles diameterwhen i saw some i looked around closely for more and made a careful reckoning of the place with my instruments i also took pictures of 10 or 12 of the most typical blocks and will enclose the prints for you to see i turned my information and pictures over to the government at perth but they have done nothing with them then i met dr boyle who had read your articles in thejournal of the american psychological societyand in time happened to mention the stones he was enormously interested and became quite excited when i shewed him my snapshots saying that the stones and markings were just like those of the masonry you had dreamed about and seen described in legends he meant to write you but was delayed meanwhile he sent me most of the magazines with your articles and i saw at once from your drawings and descriptions that my stones are certainly the kind you mean you can appreciate this from the enclosed prints later on you will hear directly from dr boylenow i can understand how important all this will be to you without question we are faced with the remains of an unknown civilisation older than any dreamed of before and forming a basis for your legends as a mining engineer i have some knowledge of geology and can tell you that these blocks are so ancient they frighten me they are mostly sandstone and granite though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort ofcementorconcretethey bear evidence of water action as if this part of the world had been submerged and come up again after long agesall since these blocks were made and used it is a matter of hundreds of thousands of yearsor heaven knows how much more i dont like to think about itin view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and everything connected with them i cannot doubt but that you will want to lead an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations both dr boyle and i are prepared to coperate in such work if youor organisations known to youcan furnish the funds i can get together a dozen miners for the heavy diggingthe blacks would be of no use for ive found that they have an almost maniacal fear of this particular spot boyle and i are saying nothing to others for you very obviously ought to have precedence in any discoveries or creditthe place can be reached from pilbarra in about 4 days by motor tractorwhich wed need for our apparatus it is somewhat west and south of warburtons path of 1873 and 100 miles southeast of joanna spring we could float things up the de grey river instead of starting from pilbarrabut all that can be talked over later roughly the stones lie at a point about 22 3 14 south latitude 125 0 39 east longitude the climate is tropical and the desert conditions are trying any expedition had better be made in winterjune or july or august i shall welcome further correspondence upon this subject and am keenly eager to assist in any plan you may devise after studying your articles i am deeply impressed with the profound significance of the whole matter dr boyle will write later when rapid communication is needed a cable to perth can be relayed by wirelesshoping profoundly for an early messagebelieve memost faithfully yoursrobert b f mackenzieof the immediate aftermath of this letter much can be learned from the press my good fortune in securing the backing of miskatonic university was great and both mr mackenzie and dr boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the australian end we were not too specific with the public about our objects since the whole matter would have lent itself unpleasantly to sensational and jocose treatment by the cheaper newspapers as a result printed reports were sparing but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported australian ruins and to chronicle our various preparatory stepsprofessors william dyer of the colleges geology department leader of the miskatonic antarctic expedition of 193031 ferdinand c ashley of the department of ancient history and tyler m freeborn of the department of anthropologytogether with my son wingateaccompanied me my correspondent mackenzie came to arkham early in 1935 and assisted in our final preparations he proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man of about fifty admirably wellread and deeply familiar with all the conditions of australian travel he had tractors waiting at pilbarra and we chartered a tramp steamer of sufficiently light draught to get up the river to that point we were prepared to excavate in the most careful and scientific fashion sifting every particle of sand and disturbing nothing which might seem to be in or near its original situationsailing from boston aboard the wheezylexingtonon march 28 1935 we had a leisurely trip across the atlantic and mediterranean through the suez canal down the red sea and across the indian ocean to our goal i need not tell how the sight of the low sandy west australian coast depressed me and how i detested the crude mining town and dreary gold fields where the tractors were given their last loads dr boyle who met us proved to be elderly pleasant and intelligentand his knowledge of psychology led him into many long discussions with my son and mediscomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our party of eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock on friday may 31st we forded a branch of the de grey and entered the realm of utter desolation a certain positive terror grew on me as we advanced to this actual site of the elder world behind the legendsa terror of course abetted by the fact that my disturbing dreams and pseudomemories still beset me with unabated forceit was on monday june 3 that we saw the first of the halfburied blocks i cannot describe the emotions with which i actually touchedin objective realitya fragment of cyclopean masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of my dreambuildings there was a distinct trace of carvingand my hands trembled as i recognised part of a curvilinear decorative scheme made hellish to me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling researcha month of digging brought a total of some 1250 blocks in varying stages of wear and disintegration most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms a minority were smaller flatter plainsurfaced and square or octagonally cutlike those of the floors and pavements in my dreamswhile a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining or as parts of arches or round window casings the deeperand the farther north and eastwe dug the more blocks we found though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them professor dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments and freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain papuan and polynesian legends of infinite antiquity the condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagerywe had an aroplane with us and my son wingate would often go up to different heights and scan the sandandrock waste for signs of dim largescale outlineseither differences of level or trails of scattered blocks his results were virtually negative for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by another equally insubstantiala result of the shifting windblown sand one or two of these ephemeral suggestions though affected me queerly and disagreeably they seemed after a fashion to dovetail horribly with something which i had dreamed or read but which i could no longer remember there was a terriblepseudofamiliarityabout themwhich somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the abominable sterile terrain toward the north and northeastaround the first week in july i developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that general northeasterly region there was horror and there was curiositybut more than that there was a persistent and perplexing illusion ofmemoryi tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head but met with no success sleeplessness also gained upon me but i almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my dreamperiods i acquired the habit of taking long lone walks in the desert late at nightusually to the north or northeast whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly to pull mesometimes on these walks i would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient masonry though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started i felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface the ground was less level than at our camp and the prevailing high winds now and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary hillocksexposing some traces of the elder stones while it covered other traces i was queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory yet at the same time dreaded what might be revealed obviously i was getting into a rather bad stateall the worse because i could not account for itan indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an odd discovery which i made on one of my nocturnal rambles it was on the evening of july 11th when a gibbous moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a curious pallor wandering somewhat beyond my usual limits i came upon a great stone which seemed to differ markedly from any we had yet encountered it was almost wholly covered but i stooped and cleared away the sand with my hands later studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with my electric torch unlike the other very large rocks this one was perfectly squarecut with no convex or concave surface it seemed too to be of a dark basaltic substance wholly dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the now familiar fragmentssuddenly i rose turned and ran for the camp at top speed it was a wholly unconscious and irrational flight and only when i was close to my tent did i fully realise why i had run then it came to me the queer dark stone was something which i had dreamed and read about and which was linked with the uttermost horrors of the aeonold legendry it was one of the blocks of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled great race held in such fearthe tall windowless ruins left by those brooding halfmaterial alien things that festered in earths nether abysses and against whose windlike invisible forces the trapdoors were sealed and the sleepless sentinels postedi remained awake all that night but by dawn realised how silly i had been to let the shadow of a myth upset me instead of being frightened i should have had a discoverers enthusiasm the next forenoon i told the others about my find and dyer freeborn boyle my son and i set out to view the anomalous block failure however confronted us i had formed no clear idea of the stones location and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sandvii come now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrativeall the more difficult because i cannot be quite certain of its reality at times i feel uncomfortably sure that i was not dreaming or deluded and it is this feelingin view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience would raisewhich impels me to make this record my sona trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole caseshall be the primary judge of what i have to tellfirst let me outline the externals of the matter as those at the camp know them on the night of july 1718 after a windy day i retired early but could not sleep rising shortly before eleven and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain i set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks seeing and greeting only one personan australian miner named tupperas i left our precincts the moon slightly past full shone from a clear sky and drenched the ancient sands with a white leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely evil there was no longer any wind nor did any return for nearly five hours as amply attested by tupper and others who did not sleep through the night the australian last saw me walking rapidly across the pallid secretguarding hillocks toward the northeastabout 330 am a violent wind blew up waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents the sky was unclouded and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight as the party saw to the tents my absence was noted but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm and yet as many as three menall australiansseemed to feel something sinister in the air mackenzie explained to prof freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklorethe natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky such winds it is whispered blow out of the great stone huts under the ground where terrible things have happenedand are never felt except near places where the big marked stones are scattered close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapesit was just past five with the bloated fungoid moon sinking in the west when i staggered into camphatless tattered features scratched and ensanguined and without my electric torch most of the men had returned to bed but prof dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent seeing my winded and almost frenzied state he called dr boyle and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable my son roused by the stir soon joined them and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleepbut there was no sleep for me my psychological state was very extraordinarydifferent from anything i had previously suffered after a time i insisted upon talkingnervously and elaborately explaining my condition i told them i had become fatigued and had lain down in the sand for a nap there had i said been dreams even more frightful than usualand when i was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped i had fled in panic frequently falling over halfburied stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled aspect i must have slept longhence the hours of my absenceof anything strange either seen or experienced i hinted absolutely nothingexercising the greatest selfcontrol in that respect but i spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work of the expedition and earnestly urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast my reasoning was patently weakfor i mentioned a dearth of blocks a wish not to offend the superstitious miners a possible shortage of funds from the college and other things either untrue or irrelevant naturally no one paid the least attention to my new wishesnot even my son whose concern for my health was very obviousthe next day i was up and around the camp but took no part in the excavations seeing that i could not stop the work i decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to pertha thousand miles to the southwestas soon as he had surveyed the region i wished let alone if i reflected the thing i had seen was still visible i might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule it was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up humouring me my son made the survey that very afternoon flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered yet nothing of what i had found remained in sight it was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over againthe shifting sand had wiped out every trace for an instant i half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark frightbut now i know that the loss was merciful i can still believe my whole experience an illusionespecially if as i devoutly hope that hellish abyss is never foundwingate took me to perth july 20 though declining to abandon the expedition and return home he stayed with me until the 25th when the steamer for liverpool sailed now in the cabin of theempressi am pondering long and frantically on the entire matter and have decided that my son at least must be informed it shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely in order to meet any eventuality i have prepared this summary of my backgroundas already known in a scattered way to othersand will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous nightnerves on edge and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable dreadmingled pseudomnemonic urge toward the northeast i plodded on beneath the evil burning moon here and there i saw halfshrouded by the sand those primal cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons the incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before and i could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams of the frightful legends which lay behind them and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stonesand yet i plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvousmore and more assailed by bewildering fancies compulsions and pseudomemories i thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barredthe night was windless and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea i had no goal but somehow ploughed along as if with fatebound assurance my dreams welled up into the waking world so that each sandembedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of prehuman masonry carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that i knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the great race at moments i fancied i saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks and i feared to look down lest i find myself one with them in aspect yet all the while i saw the sandcovered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors the evil burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond the windows i was awake and dreaming at the same timei do not know how long or how faror indeed in just what directioni had walked when i first spied the heap of blocks bared by the days wind it was the largest group in one place that i had so far seen and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past i drew close and paused and cast the added light of my electric torch over the tumbled pile a hillock had blown away leaving a low irregularly round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet highfrom the very outset i realised that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about these stones not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel but something in the sandworn traces of design arrested me as i scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found it was something subtler than that the impression did not come when i looked at one block alone but only when i ran my eye over several almost simultaneously then at last the truth dawned upon me the curvilinear patterns on many of these blocks wereclosely relatedparts of one vast decorative conception for the first time in this aeonshaken waste i had come upon a mass of masonry in its old positiontumbled and fragmentary it is true but none the less existing in a very definite sensemounting at a low place i clambered laboriously over the heap here and there clearing away the sand with my fingers and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size shape and style and relationships of design after a while i could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal masonry the perfect identity of the whole with some of my dreamglimpses appalled and unnerved me this was once a cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall paved with octagonal blocks and solidly vaulted overhead there would have been rooms opening off on the right and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still lower depthsi started violently as these conceptions occurred to me for there was more in them than the blocks themselves had supplied how did i know that this level should have been far underground how did i know that the plane leading upward should have been behind me how did i know that the long subterrene passage to the square of pillars ought to lie on the left one level above me how did i know that the room of machines and the rightwardleading tunnel to the central archives ought to lie two levels below how did i know that there would be one of those horrible metalbanded trapdoors at the very bottom four levels down bewildered by this intrusion from the dreamworld i found myself shaking and bathed in a cold perspirationthen as a last intolerable touch i felt that faint insidious stream of cool air trickling upward from a depressed place near the centre of the huge heap instantly as once before my visions faded and i saw again only the evil moonlight the brooding desert and the spreading tumulus of palaeogean masonry something real and tangible yet fraught with infinite suggestions of nighted mystery now confronted me for that stream of air could argue but one thinga hidden gulf of great size beneath the disordered blocks on the surfacemy first thought was of the sinister blackfellow legends of vast underground huts among the megaliths where horrors happen and great winds are born then thoughts of my own dreams came back and i felt dim pseudomemories tugging at my mind what manner of place lay below me what primal inconceivable source of ageold mythcycles and haunting nightmares might i be on the brink of uncovering it was only for a moment that i hesitated for more than curiosity and scientific zeal was driving me on and working against my growing feari seemed to move almost automatically as if in the clutch of some compelling fate pocketing my torch and struggling with a strength that i had not thought i possessed i wrenched aside first one titan fragment of stone and then another till there welled up a strong draught whose dampness contrasted oddly with the deserts dry air a black rift began to yawn and at lengthwhen i had pushed away every fragment small enough to budgethe leprous moonlight blazed on an aperture of ample width to admit mei drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening below me was a chaos of tumbled masonry sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle of about fortyfive degrees and evidently the result of some bygone collapse from above between its surface and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at whose upper edge were signs of gigantic stressheaved vaulting at this point it appeared the deserts sands lay directly upon a floor of some titan structure of earths youthhow preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion i could not then and cannot now even attempt to guessin retrospect the barest idea of a sudden lone descent into such a doubtful abyssand at a time when ones whereabouts were unknown to any living soulseems like the utter apex of insanity perhaps it wasyet that night i embarked without hesitancy upon such a descent again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along seemed to direct my course with torch flashing intermittently to save the battery i commenced a mad scramble down the sinister cyclopean incline below the openingsometimes facing forward as i found good hand and foot holds and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as i clung and fumbled more precariously in two directions beside me distant walls of carven crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch ahead however was only unbroken blacknessi kept no track of time during my downward scramble so seething with baffling hints and images was my mind that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances physical sensation was dead and even fear remained as a wraithlike inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me eventually i reached a level floor strown with fallen blocks shapeless fragments of stone and sand and detritus of every kind on either sideperhaps thirty feet apartrose massive walls culminating in huge groinings that they were carved i could just discern but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception what held me the most was the vaulting overhead the beam from my torch could not reach the roof but the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out distinctly and so perfect was their identity with what i had seen in countless dreams of the elder world that i trembled actively for the first timebehind and high above a faint luminous blur told of the distant moonlit world outside some vague shred of caution warned me that i should not let it out of my sight lest i have no guide for my return i now advanced toward the wall on my left where the traces of carving were plainest the littered floor was nearly as hard to traverse as the downward heap had been but i managed to pick my difficult way at one place i heaved aside some blocks and kicked away the detritus to see what the pavement was like and shuddered at the utter fateful familiarity of the great octagonal stones whose buckled surface still held roughly togetherreaching a convenient distance from the wall i cast the torchlight slowly and carefully over its worn remnants of carving some bygone influx of water seemed to have acted on the sandstone surface while there were curious incrustations which i could not explain in places the masonry was very loose and distorted and i wondered how many aeons more this primal hidden edifice could keep its remaining traces of form amidst earths heavingsbut it was the carvings themselves that excited me most despite their timecrumbled state they were relatively easy to trace at close range and the complete intimate familiarity of every detail almost stunned my imagination that the major attributes of this hoary masonry should be familiar was not beyond normal credibility powerfully impressing the weavers of certain myths they had become embodied in a stream of cryptic lore which somehow coming to my notice during the amnesic period had evoked vivid images in my subconscious mind but how could i explain the exact and minute fashion in which each line and spiral of these strange designs tallied with what i had dreamt for more than a score of years what obscure forgotten iconography could have reproduced each subtle shading and nuance which so persistently exactly and unvaryingly besieged my sleeping vision night after nightfor this was no chance or remote resemblance definitely and absolutely the millennially ancient aeonhidden corridor in which i stood was the original of something i knew in sleep as intimately as i knew my own house in crane street arkham true my dreams shewed the place in its undecayed prime but the identity was no less real on that account i was wholly and horribly oriented the particular structure i was in was known to me known too was its place in that terrible elder city of dreams that i could visit unerringly any point in that structure or in that city which had escaped the changes and devastations of uncounted ages i realised with hideous and instinctive certainty what in gods name could all this mean how had i come to know what i knew and what awful reality could lie behind those antique tales of the beings who had dwelt in this labyrinth of primordial stonewords can convey only fractionally the welter of dread and bewilderment which ate at my spirit i knew this place i knew what lay before me and what had lain overhead before the myriad towering stories had fallen to dust and debris and the desert no need now i thought with a shudder to keep that faint blur of moonlight in view i was torn betwixt a longing to flee and a feverish mixture of burning curiosity and driving fatality what had happened to this monstrous megalopolis of eld in the millions of years since the time of my dreams of the subterrene mazes which had underlain the city and linked all its titan towers how much had still survived the writhings of earths crusthad i come upon a whole buried world of unholy archaism could i still find the house of the writingmaster and the tower where sggha a captive mind from the starheaded vegetable carnivores of antarctica had chiselled certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls would the passage at the second level down to the hall of the alien minds be still unchoked and traversable in that hall the captive mind of an incredible entitya halfplastic denizen of the hollow interior of an unknown transplutonian planet eighteen million years in the futurehad kept a certain thing which it had modelled from clayi shut my eyes and put my hand to my head in a vain pitiful effort to drive these insane dreamfragments from my consciousness then for the first time i felt acutely the coolness motion and dampness of the surrounding air shuddering i realised that a vast chain of aeondead black gulfs must indeed be yawning somewhere beyond and below me i thought of the frightful chambers and corridors and inclines as i recalled them from my dreams would the way to the central archives still be open again that driving fatality tugged insistently at my brain as i recalled the awesome records that once lay cased in those rectangular vaults of rustless metalthere said the dreams and legends had reposed the whole history past and future of the cosmic spacetime continuumwritten by captive minds from every orb and every age in the solar system madness of coursebut had i not now stumbled into a nighted world as mad as i i thought of the locked metal shelves and of the curious knobtwistings needed to open each one my own came vividly into my consciousness how often had i gone through that intricate routine of varied turns and pressures in the terrestrial vertebrate section on the lowest level every detail was fresh and familiar if there were such a vault as i had dreamed of i could open it in a moment it was then that madness took me utterly an instant later and i was leaping and stumbling over the rocky debris toward the wellremembered incline to the depths belowviifrom that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be relied onindeed i still possess a final desperate hope that they all form parts of some daemoniac dreamor illusion born of delirium a fever raged in my brain and everything came to me through a kind of hazesometimes only intermittently the rays of my torch shot feebly into the engulfing blackness bringing phantasmal flashes of hideously familiar walls and carvings all blighted with the decay of ages in one place a tremendous mass of vaulting had fallen so that i had to clamber over a mighty mound of stones reaching almost to the ragged grotesquely stalactited roof it was all the ultimate apex of nightmare made worse by the blasphemous tug of pseudomemory one thing only was unfamiliar and that was my own size in relation to the monstrous masonry i felt oppressed by a sense of unwonted smallness as if the sight of these towering walls from a mere human body was something wholly new and abnormal again and again i looked nervously down at myself vaguely disturbed by the human form i possessedonward through the blackness of the abyss i leaped plunged and staggeredoften falling and bruising myself and once nearly shattering my torch every stone and corner of that daemoniac gulf was known to me and at many points i stopped to cast beams of light through choked and crumbling yet familiar archways some rooms had totally collapsed others were bare or debrisfilled in a few i saw masses of metalsome fairly intact some broken and some crushed or batteredwhich i recognised as the colossal pedestals or tables of my dreams what they could in truth have been i dared not guessi found the downward incline and began its descentthough after a time halted by a gaping ragged chasm whose narrowest point could not be much less than four feet across here the stonework had fallen through revealing incalculable inky depths beneath i knew there were two more cellar levels in this titan edifice and trembled with fresh panic as i recalled the metalclamped trapdoor on the lowest one there could be no guards nowfor what had lurked beneath had long since done its hideous work and sunk into its long decline by the time of the posthuman beetle race it would be quite dead and yet as i thought of the native legends i trembled anewit cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm since the littered floor prevented a running startbut madness drove me on i chose a place close to the lefthand wallwhere the rift was least wide and the landingspot reasonably clear of dangerous debrisand after one frantic moment reached the other side in safety at last gaining the lower level i stumbled on past the archway of the room of machines within which were fantastic ruins of metal halfburied beneath fallen vaulting everything was where i knew it would be and i climbed confidently over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor this i realised would take me under the city to the central archivesendless ages seemed to unroll as i stumbled leaped and crawled along that debriscluttered corridor now and then i could make out carvings on the agestained wallssome familiar others seemingly added since the period of my dreams since this was a subterrene houseconnecting highway there were no archways save when the route led through the lower levels of various buildings at some of these intersections i turned aside long enough to look down wellremembered corridors and into wellremembered rooms twice only did i find any radical changes from what i had dreamed ofand in one of these cases i could trace the sealedup outlines of the archway i rememberedi shook violently and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness as i steered a hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless ruined towers whose alien basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin this primal vault was round and fully two hundred feet across with nothing carved upon the darkhued stonework the floor was here free from anything save dust and sand and i could see the apertures leading upward and downward there were no stairs or inclinesindeed my dreams had pictured those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous great race those who had built them had not needed stairs or inclines in the dreams the downward aperture had been tightly sealed and nervously guarded now it lay openblack and yawning and giving forth a current of cool damp air of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below i would not permit myself to thinklater clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor i reached a place where the roof had wholly caved in the debris rose like a mountain and i climbed up over it passing through a vast empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor vaulting this i reflected must be the cellar of the house of the metalpurveyors fronting on the third square not far from the archives what had happened to it i could not conjecturei found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stones but after a short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling how i managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage and how i dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness i do not know it was sheer madness that impelled and guided meif indeed my whole underground adventure was notas i hopea hellish delusion or phase of dreaming but i did makeor dream that i madea passage that i could squirm through as i wriggled over the mound of debrismy torch switched continuously on thrust deeply within my mouthi felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above mei was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier and picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with handheld intermittently flashing torch i came at last to a low circular crypt with archesstill in a marvellous state of preservationopening off on every side the walls or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight were densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbolssome added since the period of my dreamsthis i realised was my fated destination and i turned at once through a familiar archway on my left that i could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels i had oddly little doubt this vast earthprotected pile housing the annals of all the solar system had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself blocks of stupendous size poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of incredible toughness had combined to form a mass as firm as the planets rocky core here after ages more prodigious than i could sanely grasp its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours the vast dustdrifted floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominantthe relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head all the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed and i literally raced along the lowroofed monstrously wellremembered aisles beyond the archway i was past being astonished by the familiarity of what i saw on every hand the great hieroglyphed metal shelfdoors loomed monstrously some yet in place others sprung open and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry here and there a dustcovered heap below a gaping empty shelf seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earthtremors on occasional pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and subclasses of volumesonce i paused before an open vault where i saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust reaching up i dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty and rested it on the floor for inspection it was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual the odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me and i snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within the latter as expected was some twenty by fifteen inches in area and two inches thick the thin metal covers opening at the top its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through and i studied the queerly pigmented brushdrawn letters of the textsymbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarshipwith a haunting halfaroused memory it came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind i had known slightly in my dreamsa mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment at the same time i recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the nonterrestrial planetsas i ceased poring over this incredible document i saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail hence quickly inserted the extra battery i always had with me then armed with the stronger radiance i resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridorsrecognising now and then some familiar shelf and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeonlong death and silence the very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder never before if my mad dreams held anything of truth had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements of the particular goal of my insane racing my conscious mind held no hint there was however some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollections so that i vaguely felt i was not running at randomi came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths floors flashed by me as i raced but i did not pause to explore them in my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison i wanted to unlock something and felt that i knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it it would be like a modern safe with a combination lock dream or not i had once known and still knew how any dreamor scrap of unconsciously absorbed legendcould have taught me a detail so minute so intricate and so complex i did not attempt to explain to myself i was beyond all coherent thought for was not this whole experiencethis shocking familiarity with a set of unknown ruins and this monstrously exact identity of everything before me with what only dreams and scraps of myth could have suggesteda horror beyond all reason probably it was my basic conviction thenas it is now during my saner momentsthat i was not awake at all and that the entire buried city was a fragment of febrile hallucinationeventually i reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline for some shadowy reason i tried to soften my steps even though i lost speed thereby there was a space i was afraid to cross on this last deeply buried floor and as i drew near it i recalled what thing in that space i feared it was merely one of the metalbarred and closely guarded trapdoors there would be no guards now and on that account i trembled and tiptoed as i had done in passing through that black basalt vault where a similar trapdoor had yawned i felt a current of cool damp air as i had felt there and wished that my course led in another direction why i had to take the particular course i was taking i did not knowwhen i came to the space i saw that the trapdoor yawned widely open ahead the shelves began again and i glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap very thinly covered with dust where a number of cases had recently fallen at the same moment a fresh wave of panic clutched me though for some time i could not discover why heaps of fallen cases were not uncommon for all through the aeons this lightless labyrinth had been racked by the heavings of earth and had echoed at intervals to the deafening clatter of toppling objects it was only when i was nearly across the space that i realised why i shook so violentlynot the heap but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me in the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to bethere were places where it looked thinner as if it had been disturbed not many months before i could not be sure for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting when i brought the torchlight close to one of the queer places i did not like what i sawfor the illusion of regularity became very great it was as if there were regular lines of composite impressionsimpressions that went in threes each slightly over a foot square and consisting of five nearly circular threeinch prints one in advance of the other fourthese possible lines of footsquare impressions appeared to lead in two directions as if something had gone somewhere and returned they were of course very faint and may have been illusions or accidents but there was an element of dim fumbling terror about the way i thought they ran for at one end of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered down not long before while at the other end was the ominous trapdoor with the cool damp wind yawning unguarded down to abysses past imaginationviiithat my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by its conquest of my fear no rational motive could have drawn me on after that hideous suspicion of prints and the creeping dreammemories it excited yet my right hand even as it shook with fright still twitched rhythmically in its eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find before i knew it i was past the heap of lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken dust toward a point which i seemed to know morbidly horribly well my mind was asking itself questions whose origin and relevancy i was only beginning to guess would the shelf be reachable by a human body could my human hand master all the aeonremembered motions of the lock would the lock be undamaged and workable and what would i dowhat dare i dowith what as i now commenced to realise i both hoped and feared to find would it prove the awesome brainshattering truth of something past normal conception or shew only that i was dreamingthe next i knew i had ceased my tiptoe racing and was standing still staring at a row of maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves they were in a state of almost perfect preservation and only three of the doors in this vicinity had sprung open my feelings toward these shelves cannot be describedso utter and insistent was the sense of old acquaintance i was looking high up at a row near the top and wholly out of my reach and wondering how i could climb to best advantage an open door four rows from the bottom would help and the locks of the closed doors formed possible holds for hands and feet i would grip the torch between my teeth as i had in other places where both hands were needed above all i must make no noise how to get down what i wished to remove would be difficult but i could probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack again i wondered whether the lock would be undamaged that i could repeat each familiar motion i had not the least doubt but i hoped the thing would not scrape or creakand that my hand could work it properlyeven as i thought these things i had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to climb the projecting locks were poor supports but as i had expected the opened shelf helped greatly i used both the difficultly swinging door and the edge of the aperture itself in my ascent and managed to avoid any loud creaking balanced on the upper edge of the door and leaning far to my right i could just reach the lock i sought my fingers halfnumb from climbing were very clumsy at first but i soon saw that they were anatomically adequate and the memoryrhythm was strong in them out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate secret motions had somehow reached my brain correctly in every detailfor after less than five minutes of trying there came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because i had not consciously anticipated it in another instant the metal door was slowly swinging open with only the faintest grating sounddazedly i looked over the row of greyish caseends thus exposed and felt a tremendous surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion just within reach of my right hand was a case whose curving hieroglyphs made me shake with a pang infinitely more complex than one of mere fright still shaking i managed to dislodge it amidst a shower of gritty flakes and ease it over toward myself without any violent noise like the other case i had handled it was slightly more than twenty by fifteen inches in size with curved mathematical designs in low relief in thickness it just exceeded three inches crudely wedging it between myself and the surface i was climbing i fumbled with the fastener and finally got the hook free lifting the cover i shifted the heavy object to my back and let the hook catch hold of my collar hands now free i awkwardly clambered down to the dusty floor and prepared to inspect my prizekneeling in the gritty dust i swung the case around and rested it in front of me my hands shook and i dreaded to draw out the book within almost as much as i longedand felt compelledto do so it had very gradually become clear to me what i ought to find and this realisation nearly paralysed my faculties if the thing were thereand if i were not dreamingthe implications would be quite beyond the power of the human spirit to bear what tormented me most was my momentary inability to feel that my surroundings were a dream the sense of reality was hideousand again becomes so as i recall the sceneat length i tremblingly pulled the book from its container and stared fascinatedly at the wellknown hieroglyphs on the cover it seemed to be in prime condition and the curvilinear letters of the title held me in almost as hypnotised a state as if i could read them indeed i cannot swear that i did not actually read them in some transient and terrible access of abnormal memory i do not know how long it was before i dared to lift that thin metal cover i temporised and made excuses to myself i took the torch from my mouth and shut it off to save the battery then in the dark i screwed up my couragefinally lifting the cover without turning on the light last of all i did indeed flash the torch upon the exposed pagesteeling myself in advance to suppress any sound no matter what i should findi looked for an instant then almost collapsed clenching my teeth however i kept silence i sank wholly to the floor and put a hand to my forehead amidst the engulfing blackness what i dreaded and expected was there either i was dreaming or time and space had become a mockery i must be dreamingbut i would test the horror by carrying this thing back and shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality my head swam frightfully even though there were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl around me ideas and images of the starkest terrorexcited by vistas which my glimpse had opened upbegan to throng in upon me and cloud my sensesi thought of those possible prints in the dust and trembled at the sound of my own breathing as i did so once again i flashed on the light and looked at the page as a serpents victim may look at his destroyers eyes and fangs then with clumsy fingers in the dark i closed the book put it in its container and snapped the lid and the curious hooked fastener this was what i must carry back to the outer world if it truly existedif the whole abyss truly existedif i and the world itself truly existedjust when i tottered to my feet and commenced my return i cannot be certain it comes to me oddlyas a measure of my sense of separation from the normal worldthat i did not even once look at my watch during those hideous hours underground torch in hand and with the ominous case under one arm i eventually found myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past the draughtgiving abyss and those lurking suggestions of prints i lessened my precautions as i climbed up the endless inclines but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which i had not felt on the downward journeyi dreaded having to repass through that black basalt crypt that was older than the city itself where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths i thought of that which the great race had feared and of what might still be lurkingbe it ever so weak and dyingdown there i thought of those possible fivecircle prints and of what my dreams had told me of such printsand of strange winds and whistling noises associated with them and i thought of the tales of the modern blacks wherein the horror of great winds and nameless subterrene ruins was dwelt uponi knew from a carven wall symbol the right floor to enter and came at lastafter passing that other book i had examinedto the great circular space with the branching archways on my right and at once recognisable was the arch through which i had arrived this i now entered conscious that the rest of my course would be harder because of the tumbled state of the masonry outside the archive building my new metalcased burden weighed upon me and i found it harder and harder to be quiet as i stumbled among debris and fragments of every sortthen i came to the ceilinghigh mound of debris through which i had wrenched a scanty passage my dread at wriggling through again was infinite for my first passage had made some noise and i nowafter seeing those possible printsdreaded sound above all things the case too doubled the problem of traversing the narrow crevice but i clambered up the barrier as best i could and pushed the case through the aperture ahead of me then torch in mouth i scrambled through myselfmy back torn as before by stalactites as i tried to grasp the case again it fell some distance ahead of me down the slope of the debris making a disturbing clatter and arousing echoes which sent me into a cold perspiration i lunged for it at once and regained it without further noisebut a moment afterward the slipping of blocks under my feet raised a sudden and unprecedented dinthe din was my undoing for falsely or not i thought i heard it answered in a terrible way from spaces far behind me i thought i heard a shrill whistling sound like nothing else on earth and beyond any adequate verbal description it may have been only my imagination if so what followed has a grim ironysince save for the panic of this thing the second thing might never have happenedas it was my frenzy was absolute and unrelieved taking my torch in my hand and clutching feebly at the case i leaped and bounded wildly ahead with no idea in my brain beyond a mad desire to race out of these nightmare ruins to the waking world of desert and moonlight which lay so far above i hardly knew it when i reached the mountain of debris which towered into the vast blackness beyond the cavedin roof and bruised and cut myself repeatedly in scrambling up its steep slope of jagged blocks and fragments then came the great disaster just as i blindly crossed the summit unprepared for the sudden dip ahead my feet slipped utterly and i found myself involved in a mangling avalanche of sliding masonry whose cannonloud uproar split the black cavern air in a deafening series of earthshaking reverberationsi have no recollection of emerging from this chaos but a momentary fragment of consciousness shews me as plunging and tripping and scrambling along the corridor amidst the clangourcase and torch still with me then just as i approached that primal basalt crypt i had so dreaded utter madness came for as the echoes of the avalanche died down there became audible a repetition of that frightful alien whistling i thought i had heard before this time there was no doubt about itand what was worse it came from a point not behind butahead of meprobably i shrieked aloud then i have a dim picture of myself as flying through the hellish basalt vault of the elder things and hearing that damnable alien sound piping up from the open unguarded door of limitless nether blacknesses there was a wind toonot merely a cool damp draught but a violent purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling camethere are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort with that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment and seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath though in my rear that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me heedless of the noise i made i clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface i recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as i saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous trapdoors must be yawning two levels below but instead of crying out i muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream from which i must soon awake perhaps i was in campperhaps i was at home in arkham as these hopes bolstered up my sanity i began to mount the incline to the higher leveli knew of course that i had the fourfoot cleft to recross yet was too racked by other fears to realise the full horror until i came almost upon it on my descent the leap across had been easybut could i clear the gap as readily when going uphill and hampered by fright exhaustion the weight of the metal case and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind i thought of these things at the last moment and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasmmy wavering torch was growing feeble but i could tell by some obscure memory when i neared the cleft the chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead and then i became aware of the added blasts and whistlingin front of metides of abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginablenow indeed the essence of pure nightmare was upon me sanity departedand ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight i merely struggled and plunged upward over the inclines debris as if no gulf had existed then i saw the chasms edge leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength i possessed and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac vortex of loathsome sound and utter materially tangible blacknessthis is the end of my experience so far as i can recall any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoric delirium dream madness and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real there was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous sentient darkness and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life dormant rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless basalt towers upon which no light ever shonesecrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested and all the while cold fingers of damp vapour clutched and picked at me and that eldritch damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness aroundafterward there were visions of the cyclopean city of my dreamsnot in ruins but just as i had dreamed of it i was in my conical nonhuman body again and mingled with crowds of the great race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines then superimposed upon these pictures were frightful momentary flashes of a nonvisual consciousness involving desperate struggles a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind an insane batlike flight through halfsolid air a feverish burrowing through the cyclonewhipped dark and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonryonce there was a curious intrusive flash of halfsighta faint diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead then there came a dream of windpursued climbing and crawlingof wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane it was the evil monotonous beating of that maddening moonlight which at last told me of the return of what i had once known as the objective waking worldi was clawing prone through the sands of the australian desert and around me shrieked such a tumult of wind as i had never before known on our planets surface my clothing was in rags and my whole body was a mass of bruises and scratches full consciousness returned very slowly and at no time could i tell just where true memory left off and delirious dream began there had seemed to be a mound of titan blocks an abyss beneath it a monstrous revelation from the past and a nightmare horror at the endbut how much of this was real my flashlight was gone and likewise any metal case i may have discovered had there been such a caseor any abyssor any mound raising my head i looked behind me and saw only the sterile undulant sands of the wastethe daemon wind died down and the bloated fungoid moon sank reddeningly in the west i lurched to my feet and began to stagger southwestward toward the camp what in truth had happened to me had i merely collapsed in the desert and dragged a dreamracked body over miles of sand and buried blocks if not how could i bear to live any longer for in this new doubt all my faith in the mythborn unreality of my visions dissolved once more into the hellish older doubting if that abyss was real then the great race was realand its blasphemous reachings and seizures in the cosmoswide vortex of time were no myths or nightmares but a terrible soulshattering actualityhad i in full hideous fact been drawn back to a prehuman world of a hundred and fifty million years ago in those dark baffling days of the amnesia had my present body been the vehicle of a frightful alien consciousness from palaeogean gulfs of time had i as the captive mind of those shambling horrors indeed known that accursed city of stone in its primordial heyday and wriggled down those familiar corridors in the loathsome shape of my captor were those tormenting dreams of more than twenty years the offspring of stark monstrousmemorieshad i once veritably talked with minds from reachless corners of time and space learned the universes secrets past and to come and written the annals of my own world for the metal cases of those titan archives and were those othersthose shocking elder things of the mad winds and daemon pipingsin truth a lingering lurking menace waiting and slowly weakening in black abysses while varied shapes of life drag out their multimillennial courses on the planets ageracked surfacei do not know if that abyss and what it held were real there is no hope then all too truly there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out of time but mercifully there is no proof that these things are other than fresh phases of my mythborn dreams i did not bring back the metal case that would have been a proof and so far those subterrene corridors have not been found if the laws of the universe are kind they will never be found but i must tell my son what i saw or thought i saw and let him use his judgment as a psychologist in gauging the reality of my experience and communicating this account to othersi have said that the awful truth behind my tortured years of dreaming hinges absolutely upon the actuality of what i thought i saw in those cyclopean buried ruins it has been hard for me literally to set down the crucial revelation though no reader can have failed to guess it of course it lay in that book within the metal casethe case which i pried out of its forgotten lair amidst the undisturbed dust of a million centuries no eye had seen no hand had touched that book since the advent of man to this planet and yet when i flashed my torch upon it in that frightful megalithic abyss i saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle aeonbrowned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earths youth they were instead the letters of our familiar alphabet spelling out the words of the english language in my own handwriting,1
iduring the winter of 192728 officials of the federal government made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth the public first learned of it in february when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred followed by the deliberate burning and dynamitingunder suitable precautionsof an enormous number of crumbling wormeaten and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquorkeener newsfollowers however wondered at the prodigious number of arrests the abnormally large force of men used in making them and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners no trials or even definite charges were reported nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular gaols of the nation there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons but nothing positive ever developed innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated and is even now only beginning to shew signs of a sluggishly revived existencecomplaints from many liberal organisations were met with long confidential discussions and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons as a result these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent newspaper men were harder to manage but seemed largely to coperate with the government in the end only one papera tabloid always discounted because of its wild policymentioned the deepdiving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef that item gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors seemed indeed rather farfetched since the low black reef lies a full mile and a half out from innsmouth harbourpeople around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves but said very little to the outer world they had talked about dying and halfdeserted innsmouth for nearly a century and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted years before many things had taught them secretiveness and there was now no need to exert pressure on them besides they really knew very little for wide salt marshes desolate and unpeopled keep neighbours off from innsmouth on the landward sidebut at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing results i am certain are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at innsmouth besides what was found might possibly have more than one explanation i do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me and i have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman and i have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measuresit was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july 16 1927 and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain but now that it is an old story with public interest and curiosity gone i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that illrumoured and evilly shadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality the mere telling helps me to restore confidence in my own faculties to reassure myself that i was not simply the first to succumb to a contagious nightmare hallucination it helps me too in making up my mind regarding a certain terrible step which lies ahead of mei never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first andso farlast time i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new englandsightseeing antiquarian and genealogicaland had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham whence my mothers family was derived i had no car but was travelling by train trolley and motorcoach always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticketoffice when i demurred at the high fare that i learned about innsmouth the stout shrewdfaced agent whose speech shewed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offeredyoucouldtake that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it aint thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth fellowjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or arkham either i guess wonder it keeps running at all i spose its cheap enough but i never see moren two or three people in itnobody but those innsmouth folks leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never ben on itthat was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth any reference to a town not shewn on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have interested me and the agents odd manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity a town able to inspire such dislike in its neighbours i thought must be at least rather unusual and worthy of a tourists attention if it came before arkham i would stop off thereand so i asked the agent to tell me something about it he was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he saidinnsmouth well its a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the manuxet used to be almost a cityquite a port before the war of 1812but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so no railroad nowb m never went through and the branch line from rowley was given up years agomore empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering everybody trades mostly here or in arkham or ipswich once they had quite a few mills but nothings left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part timethat refinery though used to be a big thing and old man marsh who owns it must be richern croesus queer old duck though and sticks mighty close in his home hes supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight grandson of captain obed marsh who founded the business his mother seems tove ben some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea islanderso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth people and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth blood they have in em but marshs children and grandchildren look just like anyone else so fars i can see ive had em pointed out to me herethough come to think of it the elder children dont seem to be around lately never saw the old manand why is everybody so down on innsmouth well young fellow you mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never let up theyve ben telling things about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story dont go down with meyou ought to hear though what some of the oldtimers tell about the black reef off the coastdevil reef they call it its well above water a good part of the time and never much below it but at that you could hardly call it an island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid itthat is sailors that didnt hail from innsmouth one of the things they had against old captain marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was right maybe he did for i dare say the rock formation was interesting and its just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it but there was talk of his dealing with daemons there fact is i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reefthat was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the folks in innsmouth was carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping it surely was bad enoughthere was riots over it and all sorts of ghastly doings that i dont believe ever got outside of townand it left the place in awful shape never came backthere cant be moren 300 or 400 people living there nowbut the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i spose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by your talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa asia the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with em youve probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape codwell there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties there certainly is a strange kind of streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl youll notice a little in sargent if you take his bus some of em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy stary eyes that never seem to shut and their skin aint quite right rough and scabby and the sides of their necks are all shrivelled or creased up get bald too very young the older fellows look the worstfact is i dont believe ive ever seen a very old chap of that kind guess they must die of looking in the glass animals hate emthey used to have lots of horse trouble before autos came innobody around here or in arkham or ipswich will have anything to do with em and they act kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when anyone tries to fish on their grounds queer how fish are always thick off innsmouth harbour when there aint any anywhere else aroundbut just try to fish there yourself and see how the folks chase you off those people used to come here on the railroadwalking and taking the train at rowley after the branch was droppedbut now they use that busyes theres a hotel in innsmouthcalled the gilman housebut i dont believe it can amount to much i wouldnt advise you to try it better stay over here and take the ten oclock bus tomorrow morning then you can get an evening bus there for arkham at eight oclock there was a factory inspector who stopped at the gilman a couple of years ago and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the place seems they get a queer crowd there for this fellow heard voices in other roomsthough most of em was emptythat gave him the shivers it was foreign talk he thought but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke it sounded so unnaturalsloppinglike he saidthat he didnt dare undress and go to sleep just waited up and lit out the first thing in the morning the talk went on most all nightthis fellowcasey his name washad a lot to say about how the innsmouth folks watched him and seemed kind of on guard he found the marsh refinery a queer placeits in an old mill on the lower falls of the manuxet what he said tallied up with what id heard books in bad shape and no clear account of any kind of dealings you know its always ben a kind of mystery where the marshes get the gold they refine theyve never seemed to do much buying in that line but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of ingotsused to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly or that was seen once or twice on some of the marsh womenfolks people allowed maybe old captain obed traded for it in some heathen port especially since he was always ordering stacks of glass beads and trinkets such as seafaring men used to get for native trade others thought and still think hed found an old pirate cache out on devil reef but heres a funny thing the old captains ben dead these sixty years and there aint ben a goodsized ship out of the place since the civil war but just the same the marshes still keep on buying a few of those native trade thingsmostly glass and rubber gewgaws they tell me maybe the innsmouth folks like em to look at themselvesgawd knows theyve gotten to be about as bad as south sea cannibals and guinea savagesthat plague of 46 must have taken off the best blood in the place anyway theyre a doubtful lot now and the marshes and the other rich folks are as bad as any as i told you there probably aint moren 400 people in the whole town in spite of all the streets they say there are i guess theyre what they call white trash down southlawless and sly and full of secret doings they get a lot of fish and lobsters and do exporting by truck queer how the fish swarm right there and nowhere elsenobody can ever keep track of these people and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time you can bet that prying strangers aint welcome around innsmouth ive heard personally of moren one business or government man thats disappeared there and theres loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellowthats why i wouldnt go at night if i was you ive never ben there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip couldnt hurt youeven though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it if youre just sightseeing and looking for oldtime stuff innsmouth ought to be quite a place for youand so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth when i had tried to question the natives in the shops the lunch room the garages and the fire station i had found them even harder to get started than the ticketagent had predicted and realised that i could not spare the time to overcome their first instinctive reticences they had a kind of obscure suspiciousness as if there were something amiss with anyone too much interested in innsmouth at the ymca where i was stopping the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal decadent place and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude clearly in the eyes of the educated innsmouth was merely an exaggerated case of civic degenerationthe essex county histories on the library shelves had very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early nineteenth century and later a minor factory centre using the manuxet as power the epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated as if they formed a discredit to the countyreferences to decline were few though the significance of the later record was unmistakable after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing that fishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity fell and largescale corporations offered competition but there was never a dearth of fish around innsmouth harbour foreigners seldom settled there and there was some discreetly veiled evidence that a number of poles and portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a peculiarly drastic fashionmost interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewellery vaguely associated with innsmouth it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham and in the display room of the newburyport historical society the fragmentary descriptions of these things were bald and prosaic but they hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness something about them seemed so odd and provocative that i could not put them out of my mind and despite the relative lateness of the hour i resolved to see the local samplesaid to be a large queerly proportioned thing evidently meant for a tiaraif it could possibly be arrangedthe librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society a miss anna tilton who lived nearby and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building since the hour was not outrageously late the collection was a notable one indeed but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lightsit took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange unearthly splendour of the alien opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion even now i can hardly describe what i saw though it was clearly enough a sort of tiara as the description had said it was tall in front and with a very large and curiously irregular periphery as if designed for a head of almost freakishly elliptical outline the material seemed to be predominantly gold though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal its condition was almost perfect and one could have spent hours in studying the striking and puzzlingly untraditional designssome simply geometrical and some plainly marinechased or moulded in high relief on its surface with a craftsmanship of incredible skill and gracethe longer i looked the more the thing fascinated me and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for at first i decided that it was the queer otherworldly quality of the art which made me uneasy all other art objects i had ever seen either belonged to some known racial or national stream or else were consciously modernistic defiances of every recognised stream this tiara was neither it clearly belonged to some settled technique of infinite maturity and perfection yet that technique was utterly remote from anyeastern or western ancient or modernwhich i had ever heard of or seen exemplified it was as if the workmanship were that of another planethowever i soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally potent source residing in the pictorial and mathematical suggestions of the strange designs the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignityhalf ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestionwhich one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense of pseudomemory as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fishfrogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evilin odd contrast to the tiaras aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in 1873 by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl the society had acquired it directly from the pawnbroker at once giving it a display worthy of its quality it was labelled as of probable eastindian or indochinese provenance though the attribution was frankly tentativemiss tilton comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its presence in new england was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence and which they repeated to this day despite the societys unvarying determination not to sellas the good lady shewed me out of the building she made it clear that the pirate theory of the marsh fortune was a popular one among the intelligent people of the region her own attitude toward shadowed innsmouthwhich she had never seenwas one of disgust at a community slipping far down the cultural scale and she assured me that the rumours of devilworship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churchesit was called she said the esoteric order of dagon and was undoubtedly a debased quasipagan thing imported from the east a century before at a time when the innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town replacing freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old masonic hall on new church greenall this to the pious miss tilton formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation but to me it was merely a fresh incentive to my architectural and historical anticipations was now added an acute anthropological zeal and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore awayiishortly before ten the next morning i stood with one small valise in front of hammonds drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus as the hour for its arrival drew near i noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street or to the ideal lunch across the square evidently the ticketagent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward innsmouth and its denizens in a few moments a small motorcoach of extreme decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down state street made a turn and drew up at the curb beside me i felt immediately that it was the right one a guess which the halfillegible sign on the windshieldarkhaminnsmouthnewbportsoon verifiedthere were only three passengersdark unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful castand when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent almost furtive fashion the driver also alighted and i watched him as he went into the drug store to make some purchase this i reflected must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ticketagent and even before i noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained it suddenly struck me as very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus owned and driven by this man or to visit any oftener than possible the habitat of such a man and his kinsfolkwhen the driver came out of the store i looked at him more carefully and tried to determine the source of my evil impression he was a thin stoopshouldered man not much under six feet tall dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed grey golf cap his age was perhaps thirtyfive but the odd deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull expressionless face he had a narrow head bulging watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink a flat nose a receding forehead and chin and singularly undeveloped ears his long thick lip and coarsepored greyish cheeks seemed almost beardless except for some sparse yellow hairs that straggled and curled in irregular patches and in places the surface seemed queerly irregular as if peeling from some cutaneous disease his hands were large and heavily veined and had a very unusual greyishblue tinge the fingers were strikingly short in proportion to the rest of the structure and seemed to have a tendency to curl closely into the huge palm as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit thema certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks and carried with him much of their characteristic smell just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess his oddities certainly did not look asiatic polynesian levantine or negroid yet i could see why the people found him alien i myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienagei was sorry when i saw that there would be no other passengers on the bus somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver but as leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth he looked curiously at me for a second as he returned forty cents change without speaking i took a seat far behind him but on the same side of the bus since i wished to watch the shore during the journeyat length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust glancing at the people on the sidewalks i thought i detected in them a curious wish to avoid looking at the busor at least a wish to avoid seeming to look at it then we turned to the left into high street where the going was smoother flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and still older colonial farmhouses passing the lower green and parker river and finally emerging into a long monotonous stretch of open shore countrythe day was warm and sunny but the landscape of sand sedgegrass and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich there were no visible houses and i could tell by the state of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts the small weatherworn telephone poles carried only two wires now and then we crossed crude wooden bridges over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general isolation of the regiononce in a while i noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundationwalls above the drifting sand and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories i had read that this was once a fertile and thickly settled countryside the change it was said came simultaneously with the innsmouth epidemic of 1846 and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil actually it was caused by the unwise cutting of woodlands near the shore which robbed the soil of its best protection and opened the way for waves of windblown sandat last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left our narrow course began to climb steeply and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky it was as if the bus were about to keep on in its ascent leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky the smell of the sea took on ominous implications and the silent drivers bent rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a grey scabrous surfacethen we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head and veer off toward cape ann on the far misty horizon i could just make out the dizzy profile of the head topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me i had i realised come face to face with rumourshadowed innsmouthit was a town of wide extent and dense construction yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life from the tangle of chimneypots scarcely a wisp of smoke came and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon one of them was crumbling down at the top and in that and another there were only black gaping holes where clockdials should have been the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in there were some large square georgian houses too with hipped roofs cupolas and railed widows walks these were mostly well back from the water and one or two seemed to be in moderately sound condition stretching inland from among them i saw the rusted grassgrown line of the abandoned railway with leaning telegraphpoles now devoid of wires and the halfobscured lines of the old carriage roads to rowley and ipswichthe decay was worst close to the waterfront though in its very midst i could spy the white belfry of a fairly wellpreserved brick structure which looked like a small factory the harbour long clogged with sand was enclosed by an ancient stone breakwater on which i could begin to discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen and at whose end were what looked like the foundations of a bygone lighthouse a sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier and upon it i saw a few decrepit cabins moored dories and scattered lobsterpots the only deep water seemed to be where the river poured out past the belfried structure and turned southward to join the ocean at the breakwaters endhere and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness those farthest south seeming the most decayed and far out at sea despite a high tide i glimpsed a long black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy this i knew must be devil reef as i looked a subtle curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion and oddly enough i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impressionwe met no one on the road but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of ruin then i noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards once or twice i saw listlesslooking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishysmelling beach below and groups of dirty simianvisaged children playing around weedgrown doorsteps somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings for almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and motions which i instinctively disliked without being able to define or comprehend them for a second i thought this typical physique suggested some picture i had seen perhaps in a book under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy but this pseudorecollection passed very quicklyas the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness the leaning unpainted houses grew thicker lined both sides of the road and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed all the houses were apparently deserted and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odour imaginablesoon cross streets and junctions began to appear those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur so far i had seen no people in the town but there now came signs of a sparse habitationcurtained windows here and there and an occasional battered motorcar at the curb pavement and sidewalks were increasingly well defined and though most of the houses were quite oldwood and brick structures of the early nineteenth centurythey were obviously kept fit for habitation as an amateur antiquarian i almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich unaltered survival from the pastbut i was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the righthand junction ahead the structures once white paint was now grey and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon this then was the former masonic hall now given over to a degraded cult as i strained to decipher this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked bell across the street and i quickly turned to look out the window on my side of the coachthe sound came from a squattowered stone church of manifestly later date than most of the houses built in a clumsy gothic fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with shuttered windows though the hands of its clock were missing on the side i glimpsed i knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized me before i knew what it really was the door of the church basement was open revealing a rectangle of blackness inside and as i looked a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not shew a single nightmarish quality in itit was a living objectthe first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the townand had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it clearly as i realised a moment later it was the pastor clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shewn me the previous evening this acting on my imagination had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed shambling form beneath it there was not i soon decided any reason why i should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudomemory was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of headdress made familiar to the community in some strange wayperhaps as treasuretrovea very thin sprinkling of repellentlooking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalkslone individuals and silent knots of two or three the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct and presently i saw a fairly deep rivergorge ahead spanned by a wide ironrailed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out as we clanked over the bridge i looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down the water far below was very abundant and i could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left from this point the noise was quite deafening then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the righthand side in front of a tall cupolacrowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a halfeffaced sign proclaiming it to be the gilman housei was glad to get out of that bus and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby there was only one person in sightan elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth lookand i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel instead i strolled out on the square from which the bus had already gone and studied the scene minutely and appraisinglyone side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river the other was a semicircle of slantroofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period from which several streets radiated away to the southeast south and southwest lamps were depressingly few and smallall lowpowered incandescentsand i was glad that my plans called for departure before dark even though i knew the moon would be bright the buildings were all in fair condition and included perhaps a dozen shops in current operation of which one was a grocery of the first national chain others a dismal restaurant a drug store and a wholesale fishdealers office and still another at the eastern extremity of the square near the river an office of the towns only industrythe marsh refining company there were perhaps ten people visible and four or five automobiles and motor trucks stood scattered about i did not need to be told that this was the civic centre of innsmouth eastward i could catch blue glimpses of the harbour against which rose the decaying remains of three once beautiful georgian steeples and toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river i saw the white belfry surmounting what i took to be the marsh refineryfor some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information he seemed exceptionally eager to talk and i soon gathered that he did not like the place its fishy smell or its furtive people a word with any outsider was a relief to him he hailed from arkham boarded with a family who came from ipswich and went back home whenever he got a moment off his family did not like him to work in innsmouth but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his jobthere was he said no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth but i could probably find my way about the street i had come down was federal west of that were the fine old residence streetsbroad washington lafayette and adamsand east of it were the shoreward slums it was in these slumsalong main streetthat i would find the old georgian churches but they were all long abandoned it would be well not to make oneself too conspicuous in such neighbourhoodsespecially north of the riversince the people were sullen and hostile some strangers had even disappearedcertain spots were almost forbidden territory as he had learned at considerable cost one must not for example linger much around the marsh refinery or around any of the still used churches or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green those churches were very oddall violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments their creeds were heterodox and mysterious involving hints of certain marvellous transformations leading to bodily immortalityof a sorton this earth the youths own pastordr wallace of asbury m e church in arkhamhad gravely urged him not to join any church in innsmouthas for the innsmouth peoplethe youth hardly knew what to make of them they were as furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows and one could hardly imagine how they passed the time apart from their desultory fishing perhapsjudging from the quantities of bootleg liquor they consumedthey lay for most of the daylight hours in an alcoholic stupor they seemed sullenly banded together in some sort of fellowship and understandingdespising the world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres of entity their appearanceespecially those staring unwinking eyes which one never saw shutwas certainly shocking enough and their voices were disgusting it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night and especially during their main festivals or revivals which fell twice a year on april 30th and october 31stthey were very fond of the water and swam a great deal in both river and harbour swimming races out to devil reef were very common and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport when one came to think of it it was generally only rather young people who were seen about in public and of these the oldest were apt to be the most taintedlooking when exceptions did occur they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy like the old clerk at the hotel one wondered what became of the bulk of the older folk and whether the innsmouth look were not a strange and insidious diseasephenomenon which increased its hold as years advancedonly a very rare affliction of course could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturitychanges involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skullbut then even this aspect was no more baffling and unheardof than the visible features of the malady as a whole it would be hard the youth implied to form any real conclusions regarding such a matter since one never came to know the natives personally no matter how long one might live in innsmouththe youth was certain that many specimens even worse than the worst visible ones were kept locked indoors in some places people sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds the tottering waterfront hovels north of the river were reputedly connected by hidden tunnels being thus a veritable warren of unseen abnormalities what kind of foreign bloodif anythese beings had it was impossible to tell they sometimes kept certain especially repulsive characters out of sight when government agents and others from the outside world came to townit would be of no use my informant said to ask the natives anything about the place the only one who would talk was a very aged but normallooking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire station this hoary character zadok allen was ninetysix years old and somewhat touched in the head besides being the town drunkard he was a strange furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers he was however unable to resist any offer of his favourite poison and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscenceafter all though little useful data could be gained from him since his stories were all insane incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own disordered fancy nobody ever believed him but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with strangers and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derivedseveral nonnative residents had reported monstrous glimpses from time to time but between old zadoks tales and the malformed denizens it was no wonder such illusions were current none of the nonnatives ever stayed out late at night there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so besides the streets were loathsomely darkas for businessthe abundance of fish was certainly almost uncanny but the natives were taking less and less advantage of it moreover prices were falling and competition was growing of course the towns real business was the refinery whose commercial office was on the square only a few doors east of where we stood old man marsh was never seen but sometimes went to the works in a closed curtained carthere were all sorts of rumours about how marsh had come to look he had once been a great dandy and people said he still wore the frockcoated finery of the edwardian age curiously adapted to certain deformities his sons had formerly conducted the office in the square but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving the brunt of affairs to the younger generation the sons and their sisters had come to look very queer especially the elder ones and it was said that their health was failingone of the marsh daughters was a repellent reptilianlooking woman who wore an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged my informant had noticed it many times and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard either of pirates or of daemons the clergymenor priests or whatever they were called nowadaysalso wore this kind of ornament as a headdress but one seldom caught glimpses of them other specimens the youth had not seen though many were rumoured to exist around innsmouththe marshes together with the other three gently bred families of the townthe waites the gilmans and the eliotswere all very retiring they lived in immense houses along washington street and several were reputed to harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view and whose deaths had been reported and recordedwarning me that many of the street signs were down the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the towns salient features after a moments study i felt sure that it would be of great help and pocketed it with profuse thanks disliking the dinginess of the single restaurant i had seen i bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on my programme i decided would be to thread the principal streets talk with any nonnatives i might encounter and catch the eight oclock coach for arkham the town i could see formed a significant and exaggerated example of communal decay but being no sociologist i would limit my serious observations to the field of architecturethus i began my systematic though halfbewildered tour of innsmouths narrow shadowblighted ways crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls i passed close to the marsh refinery which seemed oddly free from the noise of industry this building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic centre displaced after the revolution by the present town squarerecrossing the gorge on the main street bridge i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline above which rose the ghoulish decapitated steeple of an ancient church some houses along main street were tenanted but most were tightly boarded up down unpaved side streets i saw the black gaping windows of deserted hovels many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront certainly the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation the sight of such endless avenues of fishyeyed vacancy and death and the thought of such linked infinities of black brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can dispersefish street was as deserted as main though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape water street was almost its duplicate save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet the town was getting more and more on my nerves and i looked behind me furtively as i picked my way back over the tottering water street bridge the fish street bridge according to the sketch was in ruinsnorth of the river there were traces of squalid lifeactive fishpacking houses in water street smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there occasional sounds from indeterminate sources and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanesbut i seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion for one thing the people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town so that i was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which i could not quite place undoubtedly the alien strain in the innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inlandunless indeed the innsmouth look were a disease rather than a blood strain in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced casesone detail that annoyed me was thedistributionof the few faint sounds i heard they ought naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses yet in reality were often strongest inside the most rigidly boardedup facades there were creakings scurryings and hoarse doubtful noises and i thought uncomfortably about the hidden tunnels suggested by the grocery boy suddenly i found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens would be like i had heard no speech so far in this quarter and was unaccountably anxious not to do sopausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old churches at main and church streets i hastened out of that vile waterfront slum my next logical goal was new church green but somehow or other i could not bear to repass the church in whose basement i had glimpsed the inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademed priest or pastor besides the grocery youth had told me that the churches as well as the order of dagon hall were not advisable neighbourhoods for strangersaccordingly i kept north along main to martin then turning inland crossing federal street safely north of the green and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern broad washington lafayette and adams streets though these stately old avenues were illsurfaced and unkempt their elmshaded dignity had not entirely departed mansion after mansion claimed my gaze most of them decrepit and boarded up amidst neglected grounds but one or two in each street shewing signs of occupancy in washington street there was a row of four or five in excellent repair and with finely tended lawns and gardens the most sumptuous of thesewith wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to lafayette streeti took to be the home of old man marsh the afflicted refinery ownerin all these streets no living thing was visible and i wondered at the complete absense of cats and dogs from innsmouth another thing which puzzled and disturbed me even in some of the bestpreserved mansions was the tightly shuttered condition of many thirdstory and attic windows furtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and death and i could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by sly staring eyes that never shuti shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left too well did i recall the squat church from which those notes came following washington street toward the river i now faced a new zone of former industry and commerce noting the ruins of a factory ahead and seeing others with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond up the gorge on my rightthe uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared furtive shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the stilldistant startingtime of that sinister busit was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left and noticed the redfaced bushybearded wateryeyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormallooking firemen this of course must be zadok allen the halfcrazed liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredibleiiiit must have been some imp of the perverseor some sardonic pull from dark hidden sourceswhich made me change my plans as i did i had long before resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone and i was even then hurrying toward the square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay but the sight of old zadok allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainlyi had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild disjointed and incredible legends and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking to him yet the thought of this aged witness to the towns decay with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist after all the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon truthand old zadok must have seen everything which went on around innsmouth for the last ninety years curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of raw whiskeyi knew that i could not accost him then and there for the firemen would surely notice and object instead i reflected i would prepare by getting some bootleg liquor at a place where the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful then i would loaf near the fire station in apparent casualness and fall in with old zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles the youth said that he was very restless seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at a timea quart bottle of whiskey was easily though not cheaply obtained in the rear of a dingy varietystore just off the square in eliot street the dirtylooking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring innsmouth look but was quite civil in his way being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangerstruckmen goldbuyers and the likeas were occasionally in townrentering the square i saw that luck was with me forshuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman housei glimpsed nothing less than the tall lean tattered form of old zadok allen himself in accordance with my plan i attracted his attention by brandishing my newly purchased bottle and soon realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think ofi was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had prepared and was aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch of southern waterfront which i had previously visited the only people in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant breakwater and by going a few squares south i could get beyond the range of these finding a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf and being free to question old zadok unobserved for an indefinite time before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey mister behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottlei began putting out feelers as we walked along to water street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected at length i saw a grassgrown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls with the weedy length of an earthandmasonry wharf projecting beyond piles of mosscovered stones near the water promised tolerable seats and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north here i thought was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy so i guided my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy stones the air of death and desertion was ghoulish and the smell of fish almost insufferable but i was resolved to let nothing deter meabout four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight oclock coach for arkham and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark for i did not wish zadoks vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor after an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing but much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about innsmouth and its shadowhaunted past he would babble of current topics revealing a wide acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a sententious village fashiontoward the end of the second hour i feared my quart of whiskey would not be enough to produce results and was wondering whether i had better leave old zadok and go back for more just then however chance made the opening which my questions had been unable to make and the wheezing ancients rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly my back was toward the fishysmelling sea but he was facing it and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low distant line of devil reef then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves the sight seemed to displease him for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a confidential whisper and a knowing leer he bent toward me took hold of my coat lapel and hissed out some hints that could not be mistakenthars whar it all begunthat cursed place of all wickedness

an was desprate abaout everything they give a sarten number o young folks to the seathings twict every yearmayeve an halloweenreglar as cud be also give some o the carved knickknacks they made what the things agreed to give in return was plenty o fishthey druv em in from all over the seaan a few goldlike things naow an thenwal as i says the natives met the things on the little volcanic isletgoin thar in canoes with the sacrifices et cetry and bringin back any of the goldlike jools as was comin to em at fust the things didnt never go onto the main island but arter a time they come to want to seems they hankered arter mixin with the folks an havin jint ceremonies on the big daysmayeve an halloween ye see they was able to live both in an aout o waterwhat they call amphibians i guess the kanakys told em as haow folks from the other islands might wanta wipe em aout ef they got wind o their bein thar but they says they dunt keer much because they cud wipe aout the hull brood o humans ef they was willin to botherthat is any as didnt hev sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost old ones whoever they was but not wantin to bother theyd lay low when anybody visited the islandwhen it come to matin with them toadlookin fishes the kanakys kind o balked but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter seems that human folks has got a kind o relation to sech waterbeaststhat everything alive come aout o the water onct an only needs a little change to go back agin them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods thered be children as ud look human at fust but later turn moren more like the things till finally theyd take to the water an jine the main lot o things daown thar an this is the important part young fellerthem as turned into fish things an went into the waterwouldnt never diethem things never died excep they was kilt violentwal sir it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o fish blood from them deepwater things when they got old an begun to shew it they was kep hid until they felt like takin to the water an quittin the place some was more teched than others an some never did change quite enough to take to the water but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said them as was born more like the things changed arly but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy though theyd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that folks as had took to the water genrally come back a good deal to visit sos a man ud often be atalkin to his own fivetimesgreatgrandfather whod left the dry land a couple o hundred years or so aforeeverybody got aout o the idee o dyinexcep in canoe wars with the other islanders or as sacrifices to the seagods daown below or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ailments or somethin afore they cud take to the waterbut simply looked forrad to a kind o change that want a bit horrible arter a while they thought what theyd got was well wuth all theyd had to give upan i guess obed kind o come to think the same hisself when hed chewed over old walakeas story a bit walakea though was one of the few as hadnt got none of the fish bloodbein of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islandswalakea he shewed obed a lot o rites an incantations as had to do with the seathings an let him see some o the folks in the village as had changed a lot from human shape somehaow or other though he never would let him see one of the reglar things from right aout o the water in the end he give him a funny kind o thingumajig made aout o lead or something that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of em the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o prayers an sech walakea allaowed as the things was scattered all over the world sos anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an bring em up ef they was wantedmatt he didnt like this business at all an wanted obed shud keep away from the island but the capn was sharp fer gain an faound he cud git them goldlike things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of em things went on that way fer years an obed got enough o that goldlike stuff to make him start the refinery in waites old rundaown fullin mill he didnt dass sell the pieces like they was fer folks ud be all the time askin questions all the same his crews ud git a piece an dispose of it naow and then even though they was swore to keep quiet an he let his womenfolks wear some o the pieces as was more humanlike than mostwal come abaout thuttyeightwhen i was seven year oldobed he faound the island people all wiped aout between vyages seems the other islanders had got wind o what was goin on an had took matters into their own hands spose they musta had arter all them old magic signs as the seathings says was the only things they was afeard of no tellin what any o them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the seabottom throws up some island with ruins oldern the deluge pious cusses these wasthey didnt leave nothin standin on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown in some places they was little stones strewed abaoutlike charmswith somethin on em like what ye call a swastika naowadays probly them was the old ones signs folks all wiped aout no trace o no goldlike things an none o the nearby kanakys ud breathe a word abaout the matter wouldnt even admit theyd ever ben any people on that islandthat naturally hit obed pretty hard seein as his normal trade was doin very poor it hit the whole of innsmouth too because in seafarin days what profited the master of a ship genlly profited the crew proportionate most o the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o sheeplike an resigned but they was in bad shape because the fishin was peterin aout an the mills want doin none too wellthens the time obed he begun acursin at the folks fer bein dull sheep an prayin to a christian heaven as didnt help em none he told em hed knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin ye reely need an says ef a good bunch o men ud stand by him he cud mebbe git a holt o sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o fish an quite a bit o gold o course them as sarved on thesumatry queenan seed the island knowed what he meant an want none too anxious to git clost to seathings like theyd heerd tell on but them as didnt know what twas all abaout got kind o swayed by what obed had to say an begun to ast him what he cud do to set em on the way to the faith as ud bring em resultshere the old man faltered mumbled and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef when i spoke to him he did not answer so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle the insane yarn i was hearing interested me profoundly for i fancied there was contained within it a sort of crude allegory based upon the strangenesses of innsmouth and elaborated by an imagination at once creative and full of scraps of exotic legend not for a moment did i believe that the tale had any really substantial foundation but none the less the account held a hint of genuine terror if only because it brought in references to strange jewels clearly akin to the malign tiara i had seen at newburyport perhaps the ornaments had after all come from some strange island and possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone obed himself rather than of this antique toperi handed zadok the bottle and he drained it to the last drop it was curious how he could stand so much whiskey for not even a trace of thickness had come into his high wheezy voice he licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into his pocket then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers yeshe was really forming words and i could grasp a fair proportion of thempoor mattmatt he allus was agin ittried to line up the folks on his side an had long

exhaustion and i let him keep silence for a while though glancing apprehensively at my watch the tide had turned and was coming in now and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him i was glad of that tide for at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad again i strained to catch his whispersthat awful night i seed em i was up in the cupalo hordes of em swarms of em all over the reef an swimmin up the harbour into the manuxet god what happened in the streets of innsmouth that night they rattled our door but pa wouldnt open then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find

seventyeight an all the next genration is gone naowthe fust wifes children dead an the rest god knows the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent and little by little it seemed to change the old mans mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef and despite the wild absurdity of his tale i could not help beginning to share his vague apprehensiveness zadok now grew shriller and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speechhey yew why dunt ye say somethin haowd ye like to be livin in a taown like this with everything arottin an adyin an boardedup monsters crawlin an bleatin an barkin an hoppin araoun black cellars an attics every way ye turn hey haowd ye like to hear

hey dye hear me i tell yei know what them things bei seen em one night when ehahhhhah eyaahhhh the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old mans shriek almost made me faint his eyes looking past me toward the malodorous sea were positively starting from his head while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsedthere was nothing that i could see only the incoming tide with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the longflung line of breakers but now zadok was shaking me and i turned back to watch the melting of that fearfrozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums presently his voice came backalbeit as a trembling whispergit aout o heregit aout o herethey seen usgit aout fer your life dunt wait fer nothinthey know naow run fer itquickaout o this taownanother heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf and changed the mad ancients whisper to another inhuman and bloodcurdling screameyaahhhh yhaaaaaaa before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street reeling northward around the ruined warehouse walli glanced back at the sea but there was nothing there and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allenivi can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episodean episode at once mad and pitiful grotesque and terrifying the grocery boy had prepared me for it yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed puerile though the story was old zadoks insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadowlater i might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory just now i wished to put it out of my head the hour had grown perilously latemy watch said 715 and the arkham bus left town square at eightso i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my busthough the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace i could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then i would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and fearshadowed innsmouth and wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinisterlooking fellow sargent yet i did not hurry too precipitately for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner and i could easily i calculated cover the necessary distance in a halfhourstudying the grocery youths map and seeking a route i had not traversed before i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square near the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers and when i finally reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the gilman house it seemed as if many bulging watery unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellowpassengers on the coachthe bus rather early rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight and an evillooking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver sargent threw out a mailbag and a roll of newspapers and entered the hotel while the passengersthe same men whom i had seen arriving in newburyport that morningshambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language i could have sworn was not english i boarded the empty coach and took the same seat i had taken before but was hardly settled before sargent reappeared and began mumbling in a throaty voice of peculiar repulsivenessi was it appeared in very bad luck there had been something wrong with the engine despite the excellent time made from newburyport and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham no it could not possibly be repaired that night nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere sargent was sorry but i would have to stop over at the gilman probably the clerk would make the price easy for me but there was nothing else to do almost dazed by this sudden obstacle and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and halfunlighted town i left the bus and rentered the hotel lobby where the sullen queerlooking night clerk told me i could have room 428 on next the top floorlarge but without running waterfor a dollardespite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport i signed the register paid my dollar let the clerk take my valise and followed that sour solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life my room a dismal rear one with two windows and bare cheap furnishings overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low deserted brick blocks and commanded a view of decrepit westwardstretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond at the end of the corridor was a bathrooma discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl tin tub faint electric light and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixturesit being still daylight i descended to the square and looked around for a dinner of some sort noticing as i did so the strange glances i received from the unwholesome loafers since the grocery was closed i was forced to patronise the restaurant i had shunned before a stooped narrowheaded man with staring unwinking eyes and a flatnosed wench with unbelievably thick clumsy hands being in attendance the service was of the counter type and it relieved me to find that much was evidently served from cans and packages a bowl of vegetable soup with crackers was enough for me and i soon headed back for my cheerless room at the gilman getting an evening paper and a flyspecked magazine from the evilvisaged clerk at the rickety stand beside his deskas twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap ironframed bed and tried as best i could to continue the reading i had begun i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient blightshadowed town while i was still within its borders the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams and i felt i must keep the image of his wild watery eyes as far as possible from my imaginationalso i must not dwell on what that factory inspector had told the newburyport ticketagent about the gilman house and the voices of its nocturnal tenantsnot on that nor on the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway the face for whose horror my conscious mind could not account it would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty as it was the lethal mustiness blended hideously with the towns general fishy odour and persistently focussed ones fancy on death and decayanother thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room one had been there as marks clearly shewed but there were signs of recent removal no doubt it had become out of order like so many other things in this decrepit edifice in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothespress which seemed to be of the same size judging from the marks as the one formerly on the door to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy threeinone device including a screwdriver which i kept on my keyring the bolt fitted perfectly and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring not that i had any real apprehension of its need but that any symbol of security was welcome in an environment of this kind there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms and these i proceeded to fasteni did not undress but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat collar and shoes off taking a pocket flashlight from my valise i placed it in my trousers so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark drowsiness however did not come and when i stopped to analyse my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for somethinglistening for something which i dreaded but could not name that inspectors story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than i had suspected again i tried to read but found that i made no progressafter a time i seemed to hear the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with footsteps and wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up there were no voices however and it struck me that there was something subtly furtive about the creaking i did not like it and debated whether i had better try to sleep at all this town had some queer people and there had undoubtedly been several disappearances was this one of those inns where travellers were slain for their money surely i had no look of excessive prosperity or were the townsfolk really so resentful about curious visitors had my obvious sightseeing with its frequent mapconsultations aroused unfavourable notice it occurred to me that i must be in a highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me off speculating in this fashionbut i regretted none the less that i was unarmedat length feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it i bolted the newly outfitted hall door turned off the light and threw myself down on the hard uneven bedcoat collar shoes and all in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me i was sorry i had put out the light yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again then after a long dreary interval and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor there came that soft damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfilment of all my apprehensions without the least shadow of a doubt the lock on my hall door was being triedcautiously furtively tentativelywith a keymy sensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril were perhaps less rather than more tumultuous because of my previous vague fears i had been albeit without definite reason instinctively on my guardand that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis whatever it might turn out to be nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake malign purpose was all i could think of and i kept deathly quiet awaiting the wouldbe intruders next moveafter a time the cautious rattling ceased and i heard the room to the north entered with a passkey then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried the bolt held of course and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room after a moment there came another soft rattling and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door and again a receding creaking this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs so i knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time as the future would shewthe readiness with which i fell into a plan of action proves that i must have been subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours from the first i felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to be met or dealt with but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobbyrising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift valiseless flight nothing however happened and i saw that the power had been cut off clearly some cryptic evil movement was afoot on a large scalejust what i could not say as i stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch i heard a muffled creaking on the floor below and thought i could barely distinguish voices in conversation a moment later i felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices since the apparent hoarse barkings and loosesyllabled croakings bore so little resemblance to recognised human speech then i thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential buildinghaving filled my pockets with the flashlights aid i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent despite the states safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer threestory drop to the cobbled courtyard on the right and left however some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourthstory level to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two doors from my ownin one case on the north and in the other case on the southand my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances i had of making the transferi could not i decided risk an emergence into the corridor where my footsteps would surely be heard and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be insuperable my progress if it was to be made at all would have to be through the less solidly built connecting doors of the rooms the locks and bolts of which i would have to force violently using my shoulder as a batteringram whenever they were set against me this i thought would be possible owing to the rickety nature of the house and its fixtures but i realised i could not do it noiselessly i would have to count on sheer speed and the chance of getting to a window before any hostile forces became cordinated enough to open the right door toward me with a passkey my own outer door i reinforced by pushing the bureau against itlittle by little in order to make a minimum of soundi perceived that my chances were very slender and was fully prepared for any calamity even getting to another roof would not solve the problem for there would then remain the task of reaching the ground and escaping from the town one thing in my favour was the deserted and ruinous state of the abutting buildings and the number of skylights gaping blackly open in each rowgathering from the grocery boys map that the best route out of town was southward i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room it was designed to open in my direction hence i sawafter drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in placeit was not a favourable one for forcing accordingly abandoning it as a route i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room the door on the north was hung to open away from me and thisthough a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other sidei knew must be my route if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite buildings to washington or batesor else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington in any case i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region my preference would be to avoid paine since the fire station there might be open all nightas i thought of these things i looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full on the right the black gash of the rivergorge clove the panorama abandoned factories and railway station clinging barnaclelike to its sides beyond it the rusted railway and the rowley road led off through a flat marshy terrain dotted with islets of higher and dryer scrubgrown land on the left the creekthreaded countryside was nearer the narrow road to ipswich gleaming white in the moonlight i could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward arkham which i had determined to takei was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door and on how i could least audibly manage it when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs a wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached and at length a firm knock came at my outer doorfor a moment i simply held my breath and waited eternities seemed to elapse and the nauseous fishy odour of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly then the knocking was repeatedcontinuously and with growing insistence i knew that the time for action had come and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door bracing myself for the task of battering it open the knocking waxed louder and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts at last beginning my attempt i lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder heedless of shock or pain the door resisted even more than i had expected but i did not give in and all the while the clamour at the outer door increasedfinally the connecting door gave but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me rushing through the newly opened connexion i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third roomthe one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof belowbeing tried with a passkeyfor an instant i felt absolute despair since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete a wave of almost abnormal horror swept over me and invested with a terrible but unexplainable singularity the flashlightglimpsed dust prints made by the intruder who had lately tried my door from this room then with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through andgranting that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this second roombolt the hall door beyond before the lock could be turned from outsidesheer fortunate chance gave me my reprievefor the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar in a second i was through and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward my pressure took the opener off guard for the thing shut as i pushed so that i could slip the wellconditioned bolt as i had done with the other door as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack but at the same moment a passkey sounded in the next door to the north and i knew that a nearer peril was at handthe northward connecting door was wide open but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door as well as its mate on the opposite sidepushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other and moving a washstand in front of the hall door i must i saw trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers despite some hideous pantings gruntings and subdued barkings at odd intervals was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible vocal soundas i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me and perceived that the southward battering had ceased plainly most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me outside the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must landsurveying the conditions i chose the more southerly of the two windows as my avenue of escape planning to land on the inner slope of the roof and make for the nearest skylight once inside one of the decrepit brick structures i would have to reckon with pursuit but i hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard eventually getting to washington street and slipping out of town toward the souththe clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter obviously the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a batteringram the bedstead however still held firm so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump i yanked at the hangings and brought them down pole and all then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight so climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder i left behind me forever the morbid and horrorinfested fabric of the gilman housei landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip glancing up at the window i had left i observed it was still dark though far across the crumbling chimneys to the north i could see lights ominously blazing in the order of dagon hall the baptist church and the congregational church which i recalled so shiveringly there had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below and i hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm flashing my pocket lamp into the skylight i saw that there were no steps down the distance was slight however so i clambered over the brink and dropped striking a dusty floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrelsthe place was ghoulishlooking but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlightafter a hasty glance at my watch which shewed the hour to be 2 am the steps creaked but seemed tolerably sound and i raced down past a barnlike second story to the ground floor the desolation was complete and only echoes answered my footfalls at length i reached the lower hall at one end of which i saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined paine street doorway heading the other way i found the back door also open and darted out and down five stone steps to the grassgrown cobblestones of the courtyardthe moonbeams did not reach down here but i could just see my way about without using the flashlight some of the windows on the gilman house side were faintly glowing and i thought i heard confused sounds within walking softly over to the washington street side i perceived several open doorways and chose the nearest as my route out the hallway inside was black and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut resolved to try another building i groped my way back toward the courtyard but stopped short when close to the doorwayfor out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouringlanterns bobbing in the darkness and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english the figures moved uncertainly and i realised to my relief that they did not know where i had gone but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame their features were indistinguishable but their crouching shambling gait was abominably repellent and worst of all i perceived that one figure was strangely robed and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar as the figures spread throughout the courtyard i felt my fears increase suppose i could find no egress from this building on the street side the fishy odour was detestable and i wondered i could stand it without fainting again groping toward the street i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows fumbling in the rays of my flashlight i found i could open the shutters and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manneri was now in washington street and for the moment saw no living thing nor any light save that of the moon from several directions in the distance however i could hear the sound of hoarse voices of footsteps and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like footsteps plainly i had no time to lose the points of the compass were clear to me and i was glad that all the streetlights were turned off as is often the custom on strongly moonlit nights in unprosperous rural regions some of the sounds came from the south yet i retained my design of escaping in that direction there would i knew be plenty of deserted doorways to shelter me in case i met any person or group who looked like pursuersi walked rapidly softly and close to the ruined houses while hatless and dishevelled after my arduous climb i did not look especially noticeable and stood a good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south though i had never seen this space it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youths map since the moonlight would have free play there there was no use trying to evade it for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could and trusting that no oneor at least no pursuer of minewould be therejust how fully the pursuit was organisedand indeed just what its purpose might bei could form no idea there seemed to be unusual activity in the town but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread i would of course soon have to shift from washington to some other southward street for that party from the hotel would doubtless be after me i must have left dust prints in that last old building revealing how i had gained the streetthe open space was as i had expected strongly moonlit and i saw the remains of a parklike ironrailed green in its centre fortunately no one was about though a curious sort of buzz or roar seemed to be increasing in the direction of town square south street was very wide leading directly down a slight declivity to the waterfront and commanding a long view out at sea and i hoped that no one would be glancing up it from afar as i crossed in the bright moonlightmy progress was unimpeded and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied glancing about me i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the streets end far out beyond the breakwater was the dim dark line of devil reef and as i glimpsed it i could not help thinking of all the hideous legends i had heard in the last thirtyfour hourslegends which portrayed this ragged rock as a veritable gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and inconceivable abnormalitythen without warning i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef they were definite and unmistakable and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond all rational proportion my muscles tightened for panic flight held in only by a certain unconscious caution and halfhypnotic fascination and to make matters worse there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house which loomed up to the northeast behind me a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signalcontrolling my muscles and realising afresh how plainly visible i was i resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of south street gave me a seaward view what the whole proceeding meant i could not imagine unless it involved some strange rite connected with devil reef or unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock i now bent to the left around the ruinous green still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless unexplainable beaconsit was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon methe impression which destroyed my last vestige of selfcontrol and set me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception i could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulatedmy frantic running ceased before i had covered a block for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit there were footsteps and guttural sounds and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street in a second all my plans were utterly changedfor if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth i paused and drew into a gaping doorway reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel streeta second reflection was less comforting since the pursuit was down another street it was plain that the party was not following me directly it had not seen me but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape this however implied that all roads leading out of innsmouth were similarly patrolled for the denizens could not have known what route i intended to take if this were so i would have to make my retreat across country away from any road but how could i do that in view of the marshy and creekriddled nature of all the surrounding region for a moment my brain reeledboth from sheer hopelessness and from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odourthen i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley whose solid line of ballasted weedgrown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the rivergorge there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that since its brierchoked desertion made it halfimpassable and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to choose i had seen it clearly from my hotel window and knew about how it lay most of its earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the rowley road and from high places in the town itself but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth at any rate it would form my only chance of deliverance and there was nothing to do but try itdrawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter i once more consulted the grocery boys map with the aid of the flashlight the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street then west to lafayettethere edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversedand subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through lafayette bates adams and bank streetsthe latter skirting the rivergorgeto the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as southstarting once more i crossed the street to the righthand side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible noises still continued in federal street and as i glanced behind me i thought i saw a gleam of light near the building through which i had escaped anxious to leave washington street i broke into a quiet dogtrot trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye next the corner of babson street i saw to my alarm that one of the houses was still inhabited as attested by curtains at the window but there were no lights within and i passed it without disasterin babson street which crossed federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers i clung as closely as possible to the sagging uneven buildings twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon but my route would not force me to cross it during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motorcar darting across the open space bound outward along eliot street which there intersects both babson and lafayetteas i watchedchoked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatementi saw a band of uncouth crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road since that highway forms an extension of eliot street two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through mefor it seemed to me the creature was almosthoppingwhen the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress darting around the corner into lafayette street and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square but accomplished the passage without disaster my greatest dread was in recrossing broad and moonlit south streetwith its seaward viewand i had to nerve myself for the ordeal someone might easily be looking and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth nativewhen the view of the water again opened outthis time on my righti was halfdetermined not to look at it at all i could not however resist but cast a sidelong glance as i carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting shadows ahead there was no ship visible as i had half expected there would be instead the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky tarpaulincovered object its rowers though distantly and indistinctly seen were of an especially repellent aspect several swimmers were still discernible while on the far black reef i could see a faint steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before and of a curious colour which i could not precisely identify above the slant roofs ahead and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the gilman house but it was completely dark the fishy odour dispelled for a moment by some merciful breeze now closed in again with maddening intensityi had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block awayand was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike subhumanness of their crouching gait one man moved in a positively simian way with long arms frequently touching the ground while another figurerobed and tiaraedseemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilmans courtyardthe one therefore most closely on my trail as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright yet managed to preserve the casual shambling gait i had assumed to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not if they did my stratagem must have deceived them for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their coursemeanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identifyonce more in shadow i resumed my former dogtrot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side i passed two houses shewing signs of habitation one of which had faint lights in upper rooms yet met with no obstacle as i turned into adams street i felt measurably safer but received a shock when a man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front of me he proved however too hopelessly drunk to be a menace so that i reached the dismal ruins of the bank street warehouses in safetyno one was stirring in that dead street beside the rivergorge and the roar of the waterfalls quite drowned my footsteps it was a long dogtrot to the ruined station and the great brick warehouse walls around me seemed somehow more terrifying than the fronts of private houses at last i saw the ancient arcaded stationor what was left of itand made directly for the tracks that started from its farther endthe rails were rusty but mainly intact and not more than half the ties had rotted away walking or running on such a surface was very difficult but i did my best and on the whole made very fair time for some distance the line kept on along the gorges brink but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height the condition of this bridge would determine my next step if humanly possible i would use it if not i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridgethe vast barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within entering i began to use my flashlight and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me about half way across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeededi was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel the old tracks crossed river street at grade and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouths abhorrent fishy odour here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore my clothes but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley roadthe marshy region began very shortly with the single track on a low grassy embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner then came a sort of island of higher ground where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles i was very glad of this partial shelter since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view at the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer distance but meanwhile i must be exceedingly careful i was by this time thankfully certain that the railway itself was not patrolledjust before entering the cut i glanced behind me but saw no pursuer the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell then as my gaze circled inland from the town something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a secondwhat i sawor fancied i sawwas a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail but i did not at all like the look of that moving column it undulated too much and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon there was a suggestion of sound too though the wind was blowing the other waya suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties i had lately overheardall sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling centuried warrens near the waterfront i thought too of those nameless swimmers i had seen counting the parties so far glimpsed as well as those presumably covering other roads the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouthwhence could come the dense personnel of such a column as i now beheld did those ancient unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted uncatalogued and unsuspected life or had some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown outsiders on that hellish reef who were they why were they there and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmentedi had entered the brushgrown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant had the wind suddenly changed eastward so that it blew in from the sea and over the town it must have i concluded since i now began to hear shocking guttural murmurs from that hitherto silent direction there was another sound tooa kind of wholesale colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort it made me think illogically of that unpleasantly undulating column on the faroff ipswich roadand then both stench and sounds grew stronger so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cuts protection it was here i recalled that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging something was coming along that road and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance thank heaven these creatures employed no dogs for trackingthough perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the omnipresent regional odour crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away i would be able to see them but they could not except by a malign miracle see meall at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth typessomething one would not care to rememberthe stench waxed overpowering and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech were these indeed the voices of my pursuers did they have dogs after all so far i had seen none of the lower animals in innsmouth that flopping or pattering was monstrousi could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it i would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west the horde was very close nowthe air foul with their hoarse snarlings and the ground almost shaking with their alienrhythmed footfalls my breath nearly ceased to come and i put every ounce of will power into the task of holding my eyelids downi am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination the later action of the government after my frantic appeals would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasihypnotic spell of that ancient haunted and shadowed town such places have strange properties and the legacy of insane legend might well have acted on more than one human imagination amidst those dead stenchcursed streets and huddles of rotting roofs and crumbling steeples is it not possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over innsmouth who can be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old zadok allen the government men never found poor zadok and have no conjectures to make as to what became of him where does madness leave off and reality begin is it possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusionbut i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moonsaw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed it was foredoomed to failurefor who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past scarcely more than a hundred yards awayi thought i was prepared for the worst and i really ought to have been prepared considering what i had seen before my other pursuers had been accursedly abnormalso should i not have been ready to face astrengtheningof the abnormal element to look upon forms in which there was no mixture of the normal at all i did not open my eyes until the raucous clamour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead then i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the trackand i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to shewit was the end for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind nothing that i could have imaginednothing even that i could have gathered had i credited old zadoks crazy tale in the most literal waywould be in any way comparable to the daemoniac blasphemous reality that i sawor believe i saw i have tried to hint what it was in order to postpone the horror of writing it down baldly can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things that human eyes have truly seen as objective flesh what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legendand yet i saw them in a limitless streamflopping hopping croaking bleatingsurging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitishgold metal and some were strangely robed and one who led the way was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers and had a mans felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head i think their predominant colour was a greyishgreen though they had white bellies they were mostly shiny and slippery but the ridges of their backs were scaly their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid while their heads were the heads of fish with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were webbed they hopped irregularly sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs their croaking baying voices clearly used for articulate speech held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lackedbut for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me i knew too well what they must befor was not the memory of that evil tiara at newburyport still fresh they were the blasphemous fishfrogs of the nameless designliving and horribleand as i saw them i knew also of what that humped tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me their number was past guessing it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of themand certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the least fraction in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting the first i had ever hadvit was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brushgrown railway cut and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud the fishy odour too was gone innsmouths ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up greyly toward the southeast but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around my watch was still going and told me that the hour was past noonthe reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind but i felt that something hideous lay in the background i must get away from evilshadowed innsmouthand accordingly i began to test my cramped wearied powers of locomotion despite weakness hunger horror and bewilderment i found myself after a long time able to walk so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley before evening i was in the village getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes i caught the night train to arkham and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there a process i later repeated in boston with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiarand i wish for normalitys sake there were nothing more to tell perhaps it is madness that is overtaking meyet perhaps a greater horroror a greater marvelis reaching outas may well be imagined i gave up most of the foreplanned features of the rest of my tourthe scenic architectural and antiquarian diversions on which i had counted so heavily nor did i dare look for that piece of strange jewellery said to be in the miskatonic university museum i did however improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess very rough and hasty data it is true but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them the curator of the historical society theremr e lapham peabodywas very courteous about assisting me and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham who was born in 1867 and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeenit seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own and that my grandmothers family was a topic of some local curiosity there had mr peabody said been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father benjamin orne just after the civil war since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshirea cousin of the essex county marshesbut her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess but that guardians name was unfamiliar to arkham people and in time he dropped out of sight so that the governess assumed his role by court appointment the frenchwomannow long deadwas very taciturn and there were those who said she could have told more than she didbut the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young womanenoch and lydia meserve marshamong the known families of new hampshire possibly many suggested she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominenceshe certainly had the true marsh eyes most of the puzzling was done after her early death which took place at the birth of my grandmotherher only child having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree nor was i pleased by mr peabodys suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes myself however i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the welldocumented orne familyi went directly home to toledo from boston and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal in september i entered oberlin for my final year and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activitiesreminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connexion with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started around the middle of julyjust a year after the innsmouth experiencei spent a week with my late mothers family in cleveland checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes traditions and bits of heirloom material in existence there and seeing what kind of connected chart i could constructi did not exactly relish the task for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me there was a strain of morbidity there and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo my arkhamborn grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared i was eight years old then and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas her eldest son he had shot himself after a trip to new englandthe same trip no doubt which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical societythis uncle had resembled her and i had never liked him either something about the staring unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague unaccountable uneasiness my mother and uncle walter had not looked like that they were like their father though poor little cousin lawrencewalters sonhad been an almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton i had not seen him in four years but my uncle once implied that his state both mental and physical was very bad this worry had probably been a major cause of his mothers death two years beforemy grandfather and his widowed son walter now comprised the cleveland household but the memory of older times hung thickly over it i still disliked the place and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter who put at my disposal the contents of all his files including notes letters cuttings heirlooms photographs and miniaturesit was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry as i have said my grandmother and uncle douglas had always disturbed me now years after their passing i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation i could not at first understand the change but gradually a horrible sort ofcomparisonbegan to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested beforesomething which would bring stark panic if too openly thought ofbut the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the orne jewellery in a downtown safedeposit vault some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious greatgrandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce they were he said of very grotesque and almost repulsive design and had never to his knowledge been publicly worn though my grandmother used to enjoy looking at them vague legends of bad luck clustered around them and my greatgrandmothers french governess had said they ought not to be worn in new england though it would be quite safe to wear them in europeas my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs artists and archaeologists who had seen them pronounced the workmanship superlatively and exotically exquisite though no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign them to any specific art tradition there were two armlets a tiara and a kind of pectoral the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravaganceduring this description i had kept a tight rein on my emotions but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears my uncle looked concerned and paused in his unwrapping to study my countenance i motioned to him to continue which he did with renewed signs of reluctance he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piecethe tiarabecame visible but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened i did not expect it either for i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out to be what i did was to faint silently away just as i had done in that brierchoked railway cut a year beforefrom that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness my greatgrandmother had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in arkhamand did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through a trick what was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to captain obeds in arkham too the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes was obed marsh my own greatgreatgrandfather whoorwhatthen was my greatgreatgrandmother but perhaps this was all madness those whitishgold ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my greatgrandmother whoever he was and that look in the staringeyed faces of my grandmother and selfslain uncle might be sheer fancy on my partsheer fancy bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new englandfor more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success my father secured me a place in an insurance office and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible in the winter of 193031 however the dreams began they were very sparse and insidious at first but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by great watery spaces opened out before me and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my companions then theother shapesbegan to appear filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke but during the dreams they did not horrify me at alli was one with them wearing their unhuman trappings treading their aqueous ways and praying monstrously at their evil seabottom templesthere was much more than i could remember but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down some frightful influence i felt was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage and the process told heavily on me my health and appearance grew steadily worse till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static secluded life of an invalid some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyesit was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background my father seemed to notice it too for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly what was taking place in me could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglasone night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic she had changedas those who take to the water changeand told me she had never died instead she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about and had leaped to a realm whose wondersdestined for him as wellhe had spurned with a smoking pistol this was to be my realm tooi could not escape it i would never die but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earthi met also that which had been her grandmother for eighty thousand years pththyalyi had lived in yhanthlei and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead yhanthlei was not destroyed when the upperearth men shot death into the sea it was hurt but not destroyed the deep ones could never be destroyed even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them for the present they would rest but some day if they remembered they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time they had planned to spread and had brought up that which would help them but now they must wait once more for bringing the upperearth mens death i must do a penance but that would not be heavy this was the dream in which i saw ashoggothfor the first time and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquiredthe innsmouth lookso far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did i bought an automatic and almost took the step but certain dreams deterred me the tense extremes of horror are lessening and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown seadeeps instead of fearing them i hear and do strange things in sleep and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited if i did my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up stupendous and unheardof splendours await me below and i shall seek them soonirlyeh cthulhu fhtagn i ino i shall not shoot myselfi cannot be made to shoot myselfi shall plan my cousins escape from that canton madhouse and together we shall go to marvelshadowed innsmouth we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and manycolumned yhanthlei and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever,1
pp 16it was in the summer of 1927 that i suddenly cut short my sightseeing tour of new england and returned to cleveland under a nervous strain i have seldom mentioned the particulars of this trip and hardly know why i do so now except that a recent newspaper cutting has somehow relieved the tension which formerly existed a sweeping fire it appears has wiped out most of the empty ancient houses along the deserted innsmouth waterfront as well as a certain number of buildings farther inland while a singularly simultaneous explosion heard for many miles around has destroyed to a vast depth the great black reef a mile and a half out from shore where the seabottom abruptly falls to form an incalculable abyss for certain reasons i take great satisfaction in these occurrences even the first of which seems to me a blessing rather than a disaster especially am i glad that the old brick jewellery factory and the pillared order of dagon hall have gone along with the rest there is talk of incendiarism and i suppose old father iwanicki could tell much if he chose but what i know gives a very unusual angle to my opinioni never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first and last time it does not seem to be mentioned on any modern map and i was planning to go directly from newburyport to arkham and thence to gloucester if i could find transportation i had no car but was travelling by motor coach train and trolley always seeking the cheapest possible route in newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham and it was only at the station ticket office when i demurred at the high fare that i heard about innsmouth the agent whose speech shewed him to be no local man seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offeredyou could take that old bus i suppose he said with a certain hesitation but it isnt thought much of hereabouts it goes through innsmouthyou may have heard about thatand so the people dont like it run by an innsmouth manjoe sargentbut never gets any custom from here or from arkham either i guess wonder it keeps running at all i suppose its cheap enough but i never see more than two or three people in itnobody but those innsmouth folks leaves the squarefront of hammonds drug storeat 10 am and 7 pm unless theyve changed lately looks like a terrible rattletrapive never been on itthat was the first i ever heard of innsmouth any reference to a town not listed in the guidebooks would have interested me and the agents odd manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity a town able to inspire such dislike in its neighbours i thought must be at least rather unusual and worthy of a sightseers attention if it came before arkham i would stop off thereand so i asked the agent to tell me something about ithe was very deliberate and spoke with an air of feeling somewhat superior to what he saidinnsmouth well its a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the manuxet it used to be almost a cityquite a seaport before the war of 1812but the place has all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so theres no railroadthe b m never went through there and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago more empty houses than there are people i guess and no business to speak of everybody trades either here or in arkham or ipswich at one time they had quite a number of mills there but nothings left now but one jewellery refinerythats a pretty prominent proposition thoughall the travelling salesmen seem to know about it makes a special kind of fancy jewellery out of a secret alloy that nobody can analyse very well they say its platinum silver and goldbut these people sell it so cheap that you can hardly believe it guess they have a corner on that kind of goodsold man marsh who owns the thing must be richer than croesus queer old duck though and sticks pretty close around the town hes the grandson of capt obed marsh who founded the business his mother was some kind of foreignerthey say a south sea nativeso everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago they always do that about innsmouth people but his children and grandchildren look just like anybody else so far as i can see ive had em pointed out to me here never saw the old manand why is everybody so down on innsmouth wellyou mustnt take too much stock in what people around here say theyre hard to get started but once they do get started they never stop theyve been telling things about innsmouthwhispering em mostlyfor the last hundred years i guess and i gather theyre more scared than anything else some of the stories would make you laughabout old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth or about some kind of devilworship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1850 or thereaboutsbut i come from panton vermont and that kind of story doesnt go down with methe real thing behind all this is simply race prejudiceand i dont say im blaming those that hold it i hate those innsmouth folks myself and i wouldnt care to go to their town i suppose you knowthough i can see youre a westerner by the way you talkwhat a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in asia africa the south seas and everywhere else and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with them youve probably heard about the salem man that came back with a chinese wife and maybe you know theres still a colony of fiji islanders somewhere around cape codwell there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people the place was always badly cut off from the rest of the country by salt marshes and inlets and we cant be sure about the ins and outs of the matter but its pretty plain that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the 1830s and 1840s there certainly is a strange kind of a streak in the innsmouth folks todayi dont know how to express it but it sort of makes me crawl youll notice it a little in joe sargent if you take that bus some of them have flat noses big mouths weak retreating chins and a funny kind of rough grey skin the sides of their necks are sort of shrivelled or creased up and they get bald very young nobody around here or in arkham will have anything to do with them and they act kind of offish themselves when they come to town they used to ride on the railroad walking and taking the train at rowley or ipswich but now they use that busyes theres a hotel in innsmouthcalled the gilman housebut i dont believe it can amount to much i wouldnt advise you to try it better stay over here and take the ten oclock bus tomorrow morning then you can get an evening bus there for arkham at 8 oclock there was a factory inspector who stopped at the gilman a couple of years ago and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the place it seems they get a queer crowd there for this fellow heard voices in other rooms that gave him the shivers it was foreign talk but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke it sounded so unnaturalsloppinglike he saidthat he didnt dare go to sleep just kept dressed and lit out early in the morning the talk went on most of the nightthis mancasey his name washad a lot to say about the old marsh factory and what he said fitted in very well with some of the wild stories the books were in no kind of shape and the machinery looked old and almost abandoned as if it hadnt been run a great deal the place still used water power from the lower falls of the manuxet there were only a few employees and they didnt seem to be doing much it made me think when he told me about the local rumours that marsh doesnt actually make the stuff he sells many people say he doesnt get enough factory supplies to be really running the place and that he must be importing those queer ornaments from somewhereheaven knows where i dont believe that though the marshes have been selling those outlandish rings and armlets and tiaras and things for nearly a hundred years and if there were anywhere else where they got em the general public would have found out all about it by this time then too theres no shipping or inbound trucking around innsmouth that would account for such imports what does get imported is the queerest kind of glass and rubber trinketsmakes you think of what they used to buy in the old days to trade with savages but its a straight fact that all inspectors run up against queer things at the plant twenty odd years ago one of them disappeared at innsmouthnever heard of againand i myself knew george cole who went insane down there one night and had to be lugged away by two men from the danvers asylum where he is now he talks of some kind of sound and shrieks things about scaly waterdevilsand that makes me think of another of the old storiesabout the black reef off the coast devils reef they call it its almost above water a good part of the time but at that you could hardly call it a real island the story is that theres a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reefsprawled about or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top its a rugged uneven thing a good bit over a mile out and sailors used to make great detours just to avoid it one of the things they had against captain marsh was that he used to land on it sometimes when it was fairly dry probably the rock formation interested him but there was talk about his having dealings with demons that was before the big epidemic of 1846 when over half the people in innsmouth were carried off they never did quite figure out what the trouble was but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shippingmaybe that plague took off the best blood in innsmouth anyway theyre a doubtful lot nowand there cant be more than 500 or 600 of them the rich marshes are as bad as any i guess theyre all what people call white trash down southlawless and sly and full of secret doings lobster fishermen mostlyexporting by truck nobody can ever keep track of em and state school officials and census people have a devil of a time thats why i wouldnt go at night if i were you ive never been there and have no wish to go but i guess a daytime trip wouldnt hurt youeven though the people here will advise you not to take it if youre just sightseeing innsmouth ought to be quite a place for youand so i spent that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth when i had tried to question natives in the shops the lunch room and the fire station i had found them even harder to get started than the ticket agent had predicted and realised that i could not spare the time to overcome their first instinctive reticence they had a kind of obscure suspiciousness at the ymca the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal decadent place and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude holding innsmouth to be merely an exaggerated case of civic degenerationthe essex county histories on the shelves had very little to say except that the town was founded in 1643 noted for shipbuilding before the revolution a seat of great marine prosperity in the early nineteenth century and later on a minor factory centre using the manuxet as power references to decline were very few though the significance of the later records was unmistakable after the civil war all industrial life centred in the marsh refining company at the lower falls and the marketing of its products formed the only remaining bit of major commerce there were very few foreigners mostly poles and portuguese on the southern fringe of the town local finances were very bad and but for the marsh factory the place would have been bankrupti saw a good many booklets and catalogues and advertising calendars of the marsh refining company in the business department of the library and began to realise what a striking thing that lone industry was the jewels and ornaments it sold were of the finest possible artistry and the most extreme originality so delicately wrought indeed that one could not doubt but that handicraft played a large part in at least their final stages of manufacture some of the halftone pictures of them interested me profoundly for the strangeness and beauty of the designs seemed to my eye indicative of a profound and exotic geniusa genius so spectacular and bizarre that one could not help wondering whence the inspiration had come it was easy to credit the boast of one of the booklets that this jewellery was a favourite with persons of sophisticated taste and that several specimens were exhibited in museums of modern craftsmanshiplarge pieces predominatedarmlets tiaras and elaborate pendantsbut rings and lesser items were numerous the raised or incised designspartly conventional and partly with a curious marine motifwere wrought in a style of tremendous distinctiveness and of utter dissimilarity to the art traditions of any race or epoch i knew about this otherworldly character was emphasised by the oddness of the precious alloy whose general effect was suggested in several colourplates something about these pictured things fascinated me intenselyalmost disproportionatelyand i resolved to see as many original specimens as possible both at innsmouth and in shops and museums elsewhere yet there was a distinct element of repulsion mixed with the fascination proceeding perhaps from the evil and silly old legends about the founder of the business which the ticketagent had told mep 17the door of the marsh retail office was open and i walked in with considerable expectancy the interior was shabby and illlighted but contained a large number of display cases of solid and capable workmanship a youngish man came forward to meet me and as i studied his face a fresh wave of disturbance passed over me he was not unhandsome but there was something subtly bizarre and aberrant about his features and vocal timbre i could not stifle a keen sudden aversion and acquired an unexplained reluctance to seem like any sort of curious investigator before i knew it i found myself telling the fellow that i was a jewellery buyer for a cleveland firm and preparing myself to shew a merely professional interest in what i should seeit was hard though to carry out this policy the clerk switched on more lights and began to lead me from case to case but when i beheld the glittering marvels before me i could scarcely walk steadily or talk coherently it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make one literally gasp at the strange alien loveliness of these opulent objects and as i gazed fascinatedly i saw how little justice even the colourplates had done them even now i can hardly describe what i sawthough those who own such pieces or have seen them in shops and museums can supply the missing data the massed effect of so many elaborate examples was what produced my especial feeling of awe and unrest for somehow or other these singular grotesques and arabesques did not seem to be the product of any earthly handiworkleast of all a factory only a stones throw away the patterns and traceries all hinted of remote spaces and unimaginable abysses and the aquatic nature of the occasional pictorial items added to the general unearthliness some of the fabulous monsters filled me with an uncomfortable sense of dark pseudomemory which i triedp 21the taint and blasphemy of furtive innsmouth he like me was a normal being outside the pall of decay and normally terrified by it but because he was so inextricably close to the thing he had been broken in a way that i was not yet brokenshaking off the hands of the firemen who sought to detain him the ancient rose to his feet and greeted me as if i were an acquaintance the grocery youth had told me where most of uncle zadoks liquor was obtained and without a word i began leading him in that directionthrough the square and around into eliot street his step was astonishingly brisk for one of his age and bibulousness and i marvelled at the original strength of his constitution my haste to leave innsmouth had abated for the moment and i felt instead a queer curiosity to dip into this mumbling patriarchs chaotic store of extravagant mythwhen we had brought a quart of whiskey in the rear of a dismal variety store i led uncle zadok along south street to the utterly abandoned section of the waterfront and still farther southward to a point where even the fishermen on the distant breakwater could not see us where i knew we could talk undisturbed for some reason or other he seemed to dislike this arrangementcasting nervous glances out to sea in the direction of devil reefbut the lure of the whiskey was too strong for him to resist after we had found a seat on the edge of a rotting wharf i gave him a pull at the bottle and waited for it to take effect naturally i graduated the doses very carefully for i did not wish the old mans loquacity to turn into a stupor as he grew more mellow i began to venture some remarks and inquiries about innsmouth and was really startled by the terrible and sincere portentousness of his lowered voice he did not seem as crazy as his wild tales would indicate and i found myself shuddering even when i could not believe his fantastic inventions i hardly wondered at the naive credulity of superstitious father iwanicki,1
ifrom even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places the latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of providence where in the late forties edgar allan poe used to sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess mrs whitman poe generally stopped at the mansion house in benefit streetthe renamed golden ball inn whose roof has sheltered washington jefferson and lafayetteand his favourite walk led northward along the same street to mrs whitmans home and the neighbouring hillside churchyard of st johns whose hidden expanse of eighteenthcentury gravestones had for him a peculiar fascinationnow the irony is this in this walk so many times repeated the worlds greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street a dingy antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising sidehill with a great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country it does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it nor is there any evidence that he even noticed it and yet that house to the two persons in possession of certain information equals or outranks in horror the wildest phantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideousthe house wasand for that matter still isof a kind to attract the attention of the curious originally a farm or semifarm building it followed the average new england colonial lines of the middle eighteenth centurythe prosperous peakedroof sort with two stories and dormerless attic and with the georgian doorway and interior panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time it faced south with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street its construction over a century and a half ago had followed the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity for benefit streetat first called back streetwas laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers and straightened only when the removal of the bodies to the north burial ground made it decently possible to cut through the old family plotsat the start the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a precipitous lawn from the roadway but a widening of the street at about the time of the revolution sheared off most of the intervening space exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and two windows above ground close to the new line of public travel when the sidewalk was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed and poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull grey brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house properthe farmlike grounds extended back very deeply up the hill almost to wheaton street the space south of the house abutting on benefit street was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyonlike surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn rheumy brick walls and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks and similar paraphernalia set off the weatherbeaten front door with its broken fanlight rotting ionic pilasters and wormy triangular pedimentwhat i heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died there in alarmingly great numbers that i was told was why the original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the place it was plainly unhealthy perhaps because of the dampness and fungous growth in the cellar the general sickish smell the draughts of the hallways or the quality of the well and pump water these things were bad enough and these were all that gained belief among the persons whom i knew only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle dr elihu whipple revealed to me at length the darker vaguer surmises which formed an undercurrent of folklore among oldtime servants and humble folk surmises which never travelled far and which were largely forgotten when providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern populationthe general fact is that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the community as in any real sense haunted there were no widespread tales of rattling chains cold currents of air extinguished lights or faces at the window extremists sometimes said the house was unlucky but that is as far as even they went what was really beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there or more accuratelyhaddied there since after some peculiar happenings over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer impossibility of renting it these persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had and those who did not die displayed in varying degree a type of anaemia or consumption and sometimes a decline of the mental faculties which spoke ill for the salubriousness of the building neighbouring houses it must be added seemed entirely free from the noxious qualitythis much i knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to shew me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation in my childhood the shunned house was vacant with barren gnarled and terrible old trees long queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered we boys used to overrun the place and i can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders the smallpaned windows were largely broken and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling shaky interior shutters peeling wallpaper falling plaster rickety staircases and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained the dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the gable ends and filled with a massed wreckage of chests chairs and spinningwheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapesbut after all the attic was not the most terrible part of the house it was the dank humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion on us even though it was wholly above ground on the street side with only a thin door and windowpierced brick wall to separate it from the busy sidewalk we scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity for one thing the bad odour of the house was strongest there and for another thing we did not like the white fungous growths which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor those fungi grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside were truly horrible in their outlines detestable parodies of toadstools and indian pipes whose like we had never seen in any other situation they rotted quickly and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent so that nocturnal passersby sometimes spoke of witchfires glowing behind the broken panes of the foetorspreading windowswe nevereven in our wildest halloween moodsvisited this cellar by night but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence especially when the day was dark and wet there was also a subtler thing we often thought we detecteda very strange thing which was however merely suggestive at most i refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floora vague shifting deposit of mould or nitre which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance to a doubledup human figure though generally no such kinship existed and often there was no whitish deposit whatever on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong and when in addition i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin yellowish shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace i spoke to my uncle about the matter he smiled at this odd conceit but it seemed that his smile was tinged with reminiscence later i heard that a similar notion entered into some of the wild ancient tales of the common folka notion likewise alluding to ghoulish wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney and queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous treeroots that thrust their way into the cellar through the loose foundationstonesiinot till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data which he had collected concerning the shunned house dr whipple was a sane conservative physician of the old school and for all his interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward the abnormal his own view postulating simply a building and location of markedly unsanitary qualities had nothing to do with abnormality but he realised that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own interest would in a boys fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome imaginative associationsthe doctor was a bachelor a whitehaired cleanshaven oldfashioned gentleman and a local historian of note who had often broken a lance with such controversial guardians of tradition as sidney s rider and thomas w bicknell he lived with one manservant in a georgian homestead with knocker and ironrailed steps balanced eerily on a steep ascent of north court street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfathera cousin of that celebrated privateersman capt whipple who burnt his majestys armed schoonergaspeein 1772had voted in the legislature on may 4 1776 for the independence of the rhode island colony around him in the damp lowceiled library with the musty white panelling heavy carved overmantel and smallpaned vineshaded windows were the relics and records of his ancient family among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in benefit street that pest spot lies not far distantfor benefit runs ledgewise just above the courthouse along the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbedwhen in the end my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore i sought there lay before me a strange enough chronicle longwinded statistical and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor separate events fitted together uncannily and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities a new and burning curiosity grew in me compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate the first revelation led to an exhaustive research and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine for at last my uncle insisted on joining the search i had commenced and after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me i am lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with honour virtue good taste benevolence and learning i have reared a marble urn to his memory in st johns churchyardthe place that poe lovedthe hidden grove of giant willows on the hill where tombs and headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the houses and bank walls of benefit streetthe history of the house opening amidst a maze of dates revealed no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable family who built it yet from the first a taint of calamity soon increased to boding significance was apparent my uncles carefully compiled record began with the building of the structure in 1763 and followed the theme with an unusual amount of detail the shunned house it seems was first inhabited by william harris and his wife rhoby dexter with their children elkanah born in 1755 abigail born in 1757 william jr born in 1759 and ruth born in 1761 harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the west india trade connected with the firm of obadiah brown and his nephews after browns death in 1761 the new firm of nicholas brown co made him master of the brigprudenceprovidencebuilt of 120 tons thus enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his marriagethe site he had chosena recently straightened part of the new and fashionable back street which ran along the side of the hill above crowded cheapsidewas all that could be wished and the building did justice to the location it was the best that moderate means could afford and harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child which the family expected that child a boy came in december but was stillborn nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a halfthe next april sickness occurred among the children and abigail and ruth died before the month was over dr job ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile fever though others declared it was more of a mere wastingaway or decline it seemed in any event to be contagious for hannah bowen one of the two servants died of it in the following june eli liddeason the other servant constantly complained of weakness and would have returned to his fathers farm in rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for mehitabel pierce who was hired to succeed hannah he died the next yeara sad year indeed since it marked the death of william harris himself enfeebled as he was by the climate of martinique where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods during the preceding decadethe widowed rhoby harris never recovered from the shock of her husbands death and the passing of her firstborn elkanah two years later was the final blow to her reason in 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of insanity and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house her elder maiden sister mercy dexter having moved in to take charge of the family mercy was a plain rawboned woman of great strength but her health visibly declined from the time of her advent she was greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister and had an especial affection for her only surviving nephew william who from a sturdy infant had become a sickly spindling lad in this year the servant mehitabel died and the other servant preserved smith left without coherent explanationor at least with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the smell of the place for a time mercy could secure no more help since the seven deaths and case of madness all occurring within five years space had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumour which later became so bizarre ultimately however she obtained new servants from out of town ann white a morose woman from that part of north kingstown now set off as the township of exeter and a capable boston man named zenas lowit was ann white who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle talk mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the nooseneck hill country for that remote bit of backwoods was then as now a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions as lately as 1892 an exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the public health and peace and one may imagine the point of view of the same section in 1768 anns tongue was perniciously active and within a few months mercy discharged her filling her place with a faithful and amiable amazon from newport maria robbinsmeanwhile poor rhoby harris in her madness gave voice to dreams and imaginings of the most hideous sort at times her screams became insupportable and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her sons temporary residence with his cousin peleg harris in presbyterianlane near the new college building the boy would seem to improve after these visits and had mercy been as wise as she was wellmeaning she would have let him live permanently with peleg just what mrs harris cried out in her fits of violence tradition hesitates to say or rather presents such extravagant accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language or that the same person alone and guarded complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her in 1772 the servant zenas died and when mrs harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking delight utterly foreign to her the next year she herself died and was laid to rest in the north burial ground beside her husbandupon the outbreak of trouble with great britain in 1775 william harris despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution managed to enlist in the army of observation under general greene and from that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige in 1780 as a captain in rhode island forces in new jersey under colonel angell he met and married phebe hetfield of elizabethtown whom he brought to providence upon his honourable discharge in the following yearthe young soldiers return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness the house it is true was still in good condition and the street had been widened and changed in name from back street to benefit street but mercy dexters once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and disconcerting pallorqualities shared to a singular degree by the one remaining servant maria in the autumn of 1782 phebe harris gave birth to a stillborn daughter and on the fifteenth of the next may mercy dexter took leave of a useful austere and virtuous lifewilliam harris at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever securing temporary quarters for himself and his wife at the newly opened golden ball inn he arranged for the building of a new and finer house in westminster street in the growing part of the town across the great bridge there in 1785 his son dutee was born and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce drove them back across the river and over the hill to angell street in the newer east side residence district where the late archer harris built his sumptuous but hideous frenchroofed mansion in 1876 william and phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797 but dutee was brought up by his cousin rathbone harris pelegs sonrathbone was a practical man and rented the benefit street house despite williams wish to keep it vacant he considered it an obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boys property nor did he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so many changes of tenants or the steadily growing aversion with which the house was generally regarded it is likely that he felt only vexation when in 1804 the town council ordered him to fumigate the place with sulphur tar and gum camphor on account of the muchdiscussed deaths of four persons presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic they said the place had a febrile smelldutee himself thought little of the house for he grew up to be a privateersman and served with distinction on thevigilantunder capt cahoone in the war of 1812 he returned unharmed married in 1814 and became a father on that memorable night of september 23 1815 when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town and floated a tall sloop well up westminster street so that its masts almost tapped the harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy welcome was a seamans sonwelcome did not survive his father but lived to perish gloriously at fredericksburg in 1862 neither he nor his son archer knew of the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rentperhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age indeed it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in 1861 which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity carrington harris last of the male line knew it only as a deserted and somewhat picturesque centre of legend until i told him my experience he had meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site but after my account decided to let it stand install plumbing and rent it nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants the horror has goneiiiit may well be imagined how powerfully i was affected by the annals of the harrises in this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a persistent evil beyond anything in nature as i had known it an evil clearly connected with the house and not with the family this impression was confirmed by my uncles less systematic array of miscellaneous datalegends transcribed from servant gossip cuttings from the papers copies of deathcertificates by fellowphysicians and the like all of this material i cannot hope to give for my uncle was a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house but i may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources for example the servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous and malodorouscellarof the house a vast supremacy in evil influence there had been servantsann white especiallywho would not use the cellar kitchen and at least three welldefined legends bore upon the queer quasihuman or diabolic outlines assumed by treeroots and patches of mould in that region these latter narratives interested me profoundly on account of what i had seen in my boyhood but i felt that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the common stock of local ghost loreann white with her exeter superstition had promulgated the most extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale alleging that there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampiresthe dead who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the livingwhose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits abroad by night to destroy a vampire one must the grandmothers say exhume it and burn its heart or at least drive a stake through that organ and anns dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been prominent in bringing about her dischargeher tales however commanded a wide audience and were the more readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial purposes to me their interest depended less on this circumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with certain other thingsthe complaint of the departing servant preserved smith who had preceded ann and never heard of her that something sucked his breath at night the deathcertificates of fever victims of 1804 issued by dr chad hopkins and shewing the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood and the obscure passages of poor rhoby harriss ravings where she complained of the sharp teeth of a glassyeyed halfvisible presencefree from unwarranted superstition though i am these things produced in me an odd sensation which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned houseone from theprovidence gazette and countryjournalof april 12 1815 and the other from thedaily transcript and chronicleof october 27 1845each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable it seems that in both instances the dying person in 1815 a gentle old lady named stafford and in 1845 a schoolteacher of middle age named eleazar durfee became transfigured in a horrible way glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician even more puzzling though was the final case which put an end to the renting of the housea series of anaemia deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wristthis was in 1860 and 1861 when my uncle had just begun his medical practice and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his elder professional colleagues the really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victimsignorant people for the illsmelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no otherswould babble maledictions in french a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent it made one think of poor rhoby harris nearly a century before and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical data on the house after listening some time subsequent to his return from the war to the firsthand account of drs chase and whitmarsh indeed i could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject and that he was glad of my own interestan openminded and sympathetic interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others would merely have laughed his fancy had not gone so far as mine but he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and macabrefor my part i was disposed to take the whole subject with profound seriousness and began at once not only to review the evidence but to accumulate as much more as i could i talked with the elderly archer harris then owner of the house many times before his death in 1916 and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister alice an authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected when however i asked them what connexion with france or its language the house could have they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and ignorant as i archer knew nothing and all that miss harris could say was that an old allusion her grandfather dutee harris had heard of might have shed a little light the old seaman who had survived his son welcomes death in battle by two years had not himself known the legend but recalled that his earliest nurse the ancient maria robbins seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird significance to the french ravings of rhoby harris which she had so often heard during the last days of that hapless woman maria had been at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783 and had seen mercy dexter die once she hinted to the child dutee of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in mercys last moments but he had soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar the granddaughter moreover recalled even this much with difficulty she and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was archers son carrington the present owner with whom i talked after my experiencehaving exhausted the harris family of all the information it could furnish i turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shewn in the same work what i wished was a comprehensive history of the site from its very settlement in 1636or even before if any narragansett indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data i found at the start that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot granted originally to john throckmorton one of many similar strips beginning at the town street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a line roughly corresponding with the modern hope street the throckmorton lot had later of course been much subdivided and i became very assiduous in tracing that section through which back or benefit street was later run it had a rumour indeed said been the throckmorton graveyard but as i examined the records more carefully i found that the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the north burial ground on the pawtucket west roadthen suddenly i cameby a rare piece of chance since it was not in the main body of records and might easily have been missedupon something which aroused my keenest eagerness fitting in as it did with several of the queerest phases of the affair it was the record of a lease in 1697 of a small tract of ground to an etienne roulet and wife at last the french element had appearedthat and another deeper element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird and heterogeneous readingand i feverishly studied the platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial straightening of back street between 1747 and 1758 i found what i had half expected that where the shunned house now stood the roulets had laid out their graveyard behind a onestory and attic cottage and that no record of any transfer of graves existed the document indeed ended in much confusion and i was forced to ransack both the rhode island historical society and shepley library before i could find a local door which the name etienne roulet would unlock in the end i did find something something of such vague but monstrous import that i set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and excited minutenessthe roulets it seemed had come in 1696 from east greenwich down the west shore of narragansett bay they were huguenots from caude and had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed them to settle in the town unpopularity had dogged them in east greenwich whither they had come in 1686 after the revocation of the edict of nantes and rumour said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere racial and national prejudice or the land disputes which involved other french settlers with the english in rivalries which not even governor andros could quell but their ardent protestantismtoo ardent some whisperedand their evident distress when virtually driven from the village down the bay had moved the sympathy of the town fathers here the strangers had been granted a haven and the swarthy etienne roulet less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams was given a clerical post in the warehouse at pardon tillinghasts wharf far south in town street there had however been a riot of some sort later onperhaps forty years later after old roulets deathand no one seemed to hear of the family after thatfor a century and more it appeared the roulets had been well remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet life of a new england seaport etiennes son paul a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the family was particularly a source of speculation and though providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her puritan neighbours it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object all this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old maria robbins what relation it had to the french ravings of rhoby harris and other inhabitants of the shunned house imagination or future discovery alone could determine i wondered how many of those who had known the legends realised that additional link with the terrible which my wide reading had given me that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which tells of the creaturejacques roulet of caudewho in 1598 was condemned to death as a daemoniac but afterward saved from the stake by the paris parliament and shut in a madhouse he had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves one wolf was seen to lope away unhurt surely a pretty hearthside tale with a queer significance as to name and place but i decided that the providence gossips could not have generally known of it had they known the coincidence of names would have brought some drastic and frightened actionindeed might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the roulets from the towni now visited the accursed place with increased frequency studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden examining all the walls of the building and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor finally with carrington harriss permission i fitted a key to the disused door opening from the cellar directly upon benefit street preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the dark stairs ground floor hall and front door could give there where morbidity lurked most thickly i searched and poked during long afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed aboveground windows and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside nothing new rewarded my effortsonly the same depressing mustiness and faint suggestions of noxious odours and nitrous outlines on the floorand i fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously through the broken panesat length upon a suggestion of my uncles i decided to try the spot nocturnally and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch over the mouldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted halfphosphorescent fungi the place had dispirited me curiously that evening and i was almost prepared when i sawor thought i sawamidst the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the huddled form i had suspected from boyhood its clearness was astonishing and unprecedentedand as i watched i seemed to see again the thin yellowish shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy afternoon so many years beforeabove the anthropomorphic patch of mould by the fireplace it rose a subtle sickish almost luminous vapour which as it hung trembling in the dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the blackness of the great chimney with a foetor in its wake it was truly horrible and the more so to me because of what i knew of the spot refusing to flee i watched it fadeand as i watched i felt that it was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible when i told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused and after a tense hour of reflection arrived at a definite and drastic decision weighing in his mind the importance of the matter and the significance of our relation to it he insisted that we both testand if possible destroythe horror of the house by a joint night or nights of aggressive vigil in that musty and funguscursed cellarivon wednesday june 25 1919 after a proper notification of carrington harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find my uncle and i conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding camp cot together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and intricacy these we placed in the cellar during the day screening the windows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our first vigil we had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor and having a key to the outside cellar door we were prepared to leave our expensive and delicate apparatuswhich we had obtained secretly and at great costas many days as our vigils might need to be protracted it was our design to sit up together till very late and then watch singly till dawn in twohour stretches myself first and then my companion the inactive member resting on the cotthe natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from the laboratories of brown university and the cranston street armoury and instinctively assumed direction of our venture was a marvellous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of eightyone elihu whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician and but for what happened later would be here in full vigour today only two persons suspect what did happencarrington harris and myself i had to tell harris because he owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it then too we had spoken to him in advance of our quest and i felt after my uncles going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally necessary public explanations he turned very pale but agreed to help me and decided that it would now be safe to rent the houseto declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous we were not as i have said in any sense childishly superstitious but scientific study and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and energy in this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain forces of great power and so far as the human point of view is concerned exceptional malignancy to say that we actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement rather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter existing very infrequently in threedimensional space because of its more intimate connexion with other spatial units yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we for lack of a proper vantagepoint may never hope to understandin short it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house traceable to one or another of the illfavoured french settlers of two centuries before and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion that the family of roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entitydark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terrortheir recorded history seemed to prove had not then the riots of those bygone seventeenthirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid brain of one or more of themnotably the sinister paul rouletwhich obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob and continued to function in some multipledimensioned space along the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the encroaching communitysuch a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity and intraatomic action one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy formless or otherwise kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the lifeforce or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself it might be actively hostile or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of selfpreservation in any case such a monster must of necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder whose extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the worlds life health and sanitywhat baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might encounter the thing no sane person had even seen it and few had ever felt it definitely it might be pure energya form ethereal and outside the realm of substanceor it might be partly material some unknown and equivocal mass of plasticity capable of changing at will to nebulous approximations of the solid liquid gaseous or tenuously unparticled states the anthropomorphic patch of mould on the floor the form of the yellowish vapour and the curvature of the treeroots in some of the old tales all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connexion with the human shape but how representative or permanent that similarity might be none could say with any kind of certaintywe had devised two weapons to fight it a large and specially fitted crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with peculiar screens and reflectors in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations and a pair of military flamethrowers of the sort used in the worldwar in case it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destructionfor like the superstitious exeter rustics we were prepared to burn the things heart out if heart existed to burn all this aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged with reference to the cot and chairs and to the spot before the fireplace where the mould had taken strange shapes that suggestive patch by the way was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture and instruments and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil for a moment i half doubted that i had ever seen it in the more definitely limned formbut then i thought of the legendsour cellar vigil began at 10 pm daylight saving time and as it continued we found no promise of pertinent developments a weak filtered glow from the rainharassed streetlamps outside and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within shewed the dripping stone of the walls from which all traces of whitewash had vanished the dank foetid and mildewtainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi the rotting remains of what had been stools chairs and tables and other more shapeless furniture the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden handrail and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks andirons spit crane and a door to the dutch oventhese things and our austere cot and camp chairs and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had broughtwe had as in my own former explorations left the door to the street unlocked so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with it was our idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign entity lurked there and that being prepared we could dispose of the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had recognised and observed it sufficiently how long it might require to evoke and extinguish the thing we had no notion it occurred to us too that our venture was far from safe for in what strength the thing might appear no one could tell but we deemed the game worth the hazard and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly conscious that the seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our entire purpose such was our frame of mind as we talkedfar into the night till my uncles growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his twohour sleepsomething like fear chilled me as i sat there in the small hours alonei say alone for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone perhaps more alone than he can realise my uncle breathed heavily his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside and punctuated by another nerveracking sound of distant dripping water withinfor the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather and in this storm positively swamplike i studied the loose antique masonry of the walls in the funguslight and the feeble rays which stole in from the street through the screened windows and once when the noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me i opened the door and looked up and down the street feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my nostrils on the wholesome air still nothing occurred to reward my watching and i yawned repeatedly fatigue getting the better of apprehensionthen the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice he had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan i turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot i again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain what i saw unnerved me most surprisingly considering its relative triviality it must have been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural it was merely that my uncles facial expression disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our situation prompted betrayed considerable agitation and seemed not at all characteristic of him his habitual expression was one of kindly and wellbred calm whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him i think on the whole that it was thisvarietywhich chiefly disturbed me my uncle as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open seemed not one but many men and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himselfall at once he commenced to mutter and i did not like the look of his mouth and teeth as he spoke the words were at first indistinguishable and thenwith a tremendous starti recognised something about them which filled me with icy fear till i recalled the breadth of my uncles education and the interminable translations he had made from anthropological and antiquarian articles in therevue des deux mondesfor the venerable elihu whipple was mutteringin frenchand the few phrases i could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he had ever adapted from the famous paris magazinesuddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleepers forehead and he leaped abruptly up half awake the jumble of french changed to a cry in english and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly my breath my breath then the awakening became complete and with a subsidence of facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance i could only surmise with a kind of awehe had he said floated off from a very ordinary series of dreampictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he had ever read it was of this world and yet not of ita shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations there was a suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion in this kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snapshots if one might use the term of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneityonce my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit with a crowd of angry faces framed by straggling locks and threecornered hats frowning down on him again he seemed to be in the interior of a housean old house apparentlybut the details and inhabitants were constantly changing and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture or even of the room itself since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects it was queerdamnably queerand my uncle spoke almost sheepishly as if half expecting not to be believed when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family and all the while there was a personal sensation of choking as if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to possess itself of his vital processes i shuddered at the thought of those vital processes worn as they were by eightyone years of continuous functioning in conflict with unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams and that these uncomfortable visions could be at most no more than my uncles reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all elseconversation also soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness and in time i yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber my uncle seemed now very wakeful and welcomed his period of watching even though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours sleep seized me quickly and i was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind i felt in my visions a cosmic and abysmal loneness with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where i lay confined i seemed bound and gagged and taunted by the echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood my uncles face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours and i recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream it was not a pleasant sleep and for a second i was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and realityvi had been lying with my face away from my uncles chair so that in this sudden flash of awakening i saw only the door to the street the more northerly window and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by but it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor and had a yellowish penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed for on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking scream while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place my mind as alert as my senses recognised the gravely unusual and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace as i turned i dreaded what i was to see for the scream had been in my uncles voice and i knew not against what menace i should have to defend him and myselfyet after all the sight was worse than i had dreaded there are horrors beyond horrors and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few out of the fungusridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpselight yellow and diseased which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines halfhuman and halfmonstrous through which i could see the chimney and fireplace beyond it was all eyeswolfish and mockingand the rugose insectlike head dissolved at the top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the chimney i say that i saw this thing but it is only in conscious retrospection that i ever definitely traced its damnable approach to form at the time it was to me only a seething dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness enveloping and dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object to which all my attention was focussed that object was my unclethe venerable elihu whipplewho with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had broughtit was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad i had drilled myself in preparation for the crucial moment and blind training saved me recognising the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter or material chemistry and therefore ignoring the flamethrower which loomed on my left i threw on the current of the crookes tube apparatus and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest ether radiations which mans art can arouse from the spaces and fluids of nature there was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering and the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes but i saw the dimness was only that of contrast and that the waves from the machine had no effect whateverthen in the midst of that daemoniac spectacle i saw a fresh horror which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering toward that unlocked door to the quiet street careless of what abnormal terrors i loosed upon the world or what thoughts or judgments of men i brought down upon my head in that dim blend of blue and yellow the form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes all description and in which there played across his vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive he was at once a devil and a multitude a charnelhouse and a pageant lit by the mixed and uncertain beams that gelatinous face assumed a dozena scorea hundredaspects grinning as it sank to the ground on a body that melted like tallow in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and yet not strangei saw the features of the harris line masculine and feminine adult and infantile and other features old and young coarse and refined familiar and unfamiliar for a second there flashed a degraded counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad rhoby harris that i had seen in the school of design museum and another time i thought i caught the rawboned image of mercy dexter as i recalled her from a painting in carrington harriss house it was frightful beyond conception toward the last when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was spreading it seemed as though the shifting features fought against themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncles kindly face i like to think that he existed at that moment and that he tried to bid me farewell it seems to me i hiccoughed a farewell from my own parched throat as i lurched out into the street a thin stream of grease following me through the door to the raindrenched sidewalkthe rest is shadowy and monstrous there was no one in the soaking street and in all the world there was no one i dared tell i walked aimlessly south past college hill and the athenaeum down hopkins street and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemed to guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient and unwholesome wonder then grey dawn unfolded wetly from the east silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples and beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished and in the end i went wet hatless and dazed in the morning light and entered that awful door in benefit street which i had left ajar and which still swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom i dared not speakthe grease was gone for the mouldy floor was porous and in front of the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubledup form in nitre i looked at the cot the chairs the instruments my neglected hat and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle dazedness was uppermost and i could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality then thought trickled back and i knew that i had witnessed things more horrible than i had dreamed sitting down i tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened and how i might end the horror if indeed it had been real matter it seemed not to be nor ether nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind what then but some exoticemanationsome vampirish vapour such as exeter rustics tell of as lurking over certain churchyards this i felt was the clue and again i looked at the floor before the fireplace where the mould and nitre had taken strange forms in ten minutes my mind was made up and taking my hat i set out for home where i bathed ate and gave by telephone an order for a pickaxe a spade a military gasmask and six carboys of sulphuric acid all to be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in benefit street after that i tried to sleep and failing passed the hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my moodat 11 am the next day i commenced digging it was sunny weather and i was glad of that i was still alone for as much as i feared the unknown horror i sought there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody later i told harris only through sheer necessity and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief as i turned up the stinking black earth in front of the fireplace my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the white fungi which it severed i trembled at the dubious thoughts of what i might uncover some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind and this seemed to me one of themmy hand shook perceptibly but still i delved after a while standing in the large hole i had made with the deepening of the hole which was about six feet square the evil smell increased and i lost all doubt of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed the house for over a century and a half i wondered what it would look likewhat its form and substance would be and how big it might have waxed through long ages of lifesucking at length i climbed out of the hole and dispersed the heapedup dirt then arranging the great carboys of acid around and near two sides so that when necessary i might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession after that i dumped earth only along the other two sides working more slowly and donning my gasmask as the smell grew i was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pitsuddenly my spade struck something softer than earth i shuddered and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole which was now as deep as my neck then courage returned and i scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch i had provided the surface i uncovered was fishy and glassya kind of semiputrid congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency i scraped further and saw that it had form there was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over the exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical like a mammoth soft bluewhite stovepipe doubled in two its largest part some two feet in diameter still more i scraped and then abruptly i leaped out of the hole and away from the filthy thing frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy carboys and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titanelbowi had seenthe blinding maelstrom of greenishyellow vapour which surged tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended will never leave my memory all along the hill people tell of the yellow day when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in the providence river but i know how mistaken they are as to the source they tell too of the hideous roar which at the same time came from some disordered waterpipe or gas main undergroundbut again i could correct them if i dared it was unspeakably shocking and i do not see how i lived through it i did faint after emptying the fourth carboy which i had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask but when i recovered i saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapoursthe two remaining carboys i emptied down without particular result and after a time i felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit it was twilight before i was done but fear had gone out of the place the dampness was less foetid and all the strange fungi had withered to a kind of harmless greyish powder which blew ashlike along the floor one of earths nethermost terrors had perished forever and if there be a hell it had received at last the daemon soul of an unhallowed thing and as i patted down the last spadeful of mould i shed the first of the many tears with which i have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncles memorythe next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the shunned houses terraced garden and shortly afterward carrington harris rented the place it is still spectral but its strangeness fascinates me and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building the barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small sweet apples and last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs,1
when randolph carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space and lovely unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas but as middle age hardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by little until at last he was cut off altogether no more could his galleys sail up the river oukranos past the gilded spires of thran or his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in kled where forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moonhe had read much of things as they are and talked with too many people wellmeaning philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things and analyse the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies wonder had gone away and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings and no cause to value the one above the other custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which tangibly and physically exists and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish and he believed it because he could see that they might easily be so what he failed to recall was that the deeds of reality are just as inane and childish and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darknessthey had chained him down to things that are and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world when he complained and longed to escape into twilight realms where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight they turned him instead toward the newfound prodigies of science bidding him find wonder in the atoms vortex and mystery in the skys dimensions and when he had failed to find these boons in things whose laws are known and measurable they told him he lacked imagination and was immature because he preferred dreamillusions to the illusions of our physical creationso carter had tried to do as others did and pretended that the common events and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the fantasies of rare and delicate souls he did not dissent when they told him that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real life is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of narath with its hundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony which he dimly remembered from his dreams and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking sense of pity and tragedyonce in a while though he could not help seeing how shallow fickle and meaningless all human aspirations are and how emptily our real impulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams for he saw that the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and artificial and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and purpose in this way he became a kind of humorist for he did not see that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true standard of consistency or inconsistencyin the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty the stale and prosy triteness and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown it wearied carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasybut when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths he found them even more ugly than those who had not they did not know that beauty lies in harmony and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos they did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel and whose finer details are different for every race and culture instead they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to the crude vague instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants so that their lives were dragged malodorously out in pain ugliness and disproportion yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which still held them they had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchycarter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded he saw that most of them in common with their castoff priestcraft could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty even when all nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice freedom and consistency they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference having lost these artificial settings their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness noise and excitement barbaric display and animal sensation when these things palled disappointed or grew nauseous through revulsion they cultivated irony and bitterness and found fault with the social order never could they realise that their brute foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next calm lasting beauty comes only in dream and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of childhood and innocenceamidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage with his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station he walked impassive through the cities of men and sighed because no vista seemed fully real because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find travel was only a mockery and even the great war stirred him but little though he served from the first in the foreign legion of france for a while he sought friends but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions and the sameness and earthiness of their visions he felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him for they could not have understood his mental life that is none but his grandfather and greatuncle christopher could and they were long deadthen he began once more the writing of books which he had left off when dreams first failed him but here too was there no satisfaction or fulfilment for the touch of earth was upon his mind and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens the convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on his characters while the myth of an important reality and significant human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thinveiled allegory and cheap social satire his new novels were successful as his old ones had never been and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd he burned them and ceased his writing they were very graceful novels in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly sketched but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all their life awayit was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace most of these however soon shewed their poverty and barrenness and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them gross stupidity falsehood and muddled thinking are not dream and form no escape from life to a mind trained above their level so carter bought stranger books and sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition delving into arcana of consciousness that few have trod and learning things about the secret pits of life legend and immemorial antiquity which disturbed him ever afterward he decided to live on a rarer plane and furnished his boston home to suit his changing moods one room for each hung in appropriate colours furnished with befitting books and objects and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light heat sound taste and odouronce he heard of a man in the south who was shunned and feared for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from india and arabia him he visited living with him and sharing his studies for seven years till horror overtook them one midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard and only one emerged where two had entered then he went back to arkham the terrible witchhaunted old town of his forefathers in new england and had experiences in the dark amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel roofs which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a wildminded ancestor but these horrors took him only to the edge of reality and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dreamhaving perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things carter spent his days in retirement and in wistful disjointed memories of his dreamfilled youth he thought it rather silly that he bothered to keep on living at all and got from a south american acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering inertia and force of habit however caused him to defer action and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his early boyhoodpurple panes victorian furniture and allwith the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered for his relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and sophistication seem very distant and unreal so much so that a touch of magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers for years those slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of everyday things as the commonest slumbers know but now there returned a flicker of something stranger and wilder something of vaguely awesome immanence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his childhood days and made him think of little inconsequential things he had long forgotten he would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather both in their graves a quarter of a centurythen one night his grandfather reminded him of a key the grey old scholar as vivid as in life spoke long and earnestly of their ancient line and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive men who composed it he spoke of the flameeyed crusader who learnt wild secrets of the saracens that held him captive and of the first sir randolph carter who studied magic when elizabeth was queen he spoke too of that edmund carter who had just escaped hanging in the salem witchcraft and who had placed in an antique box a great silver key handed down from his ancestors before carter awaked the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuriesin the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it remote and forgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest it was about a foot square and its gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel no person since edmund carter had dared to open it it gave forth no noise when shaken but was mystic with the scent of unremembered spices that it held a key was indeed only a dim legend and randolph carters father had never known such a box existed it was bound in rusty iron and no means was provided for working the formidable lock carter vaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost gate of dreams but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told him nothingan old servant forced the carven lid shaking as he did so at the hideous faces leering from the blackened wood and at some unplaced familiarity inside wrapped in a discoloured parchment was a huge key of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques but of any legible explanation there was none the parchment was voluminous and held only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an antique reed carter recognised the characters as those he had seen on a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the south who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery the man had always shivered when he read this scroll and carter shivered nowbut he cleaned the key and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box of ancient oak his dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness and though shewing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken they were calling him back along the years and with the mingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden and ancestral source then he knew he must go into the past and merge himself with old things and day after day he thought of the hills to the north where haunted arkham and the rushing miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people layin the brooding fire of autumn carter took the old remembered way past graceful lines of rolling hill and stonewalled meadow distant vale and hanging woodland curving road and nestling farmstead and the crystal windings of the miskatonic crossed here and there by rustic bridges of wood or stone at one bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them then there was the crumbling farmhouse of old goody fowler the witch with its little evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north side he speeded up his car as he passed it and did not slacken till he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her were born and where the old white house still looked proudly across the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant valley with the distant spires of kingsport on the horizon and hints of the archaic dreamladen sea in the farthest backgroundthen came the steeper slope that held the old carter place he had not seen in over forty years afternoon was far gone when he reached the foot and at the bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured out by a western sun all the strangeness and expectancy of his recent dreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape and he thought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their tumbled walls the clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of purple hills beyond hills and the spectral wooded valley dipping down in shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled among swollen and distorted rootssomething made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was seeking so he left his car at the edge of the forest and putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill woods now engulfed him utterly though he knew the house was on a high knoll that cleared the trees except to the north he wondered how it would look for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death of his strange greatuncle christopher thirty years before in his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there and had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchardshadows thickened around him for the night was near once a gap in the trees opened up to the right so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old congregational steeple on central hill in kingsport pink with the last flush of day the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire then when he was in deep shadow again he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have come from childish memory alone since the old white church had long been torn down to make room for the congregational hospital he had read of it with interest for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneaththrough his puzzlement a voice piped and he started again at its familiarity after long years old benijah corey had been his uncle christophers hired man and was aged even in those faroff times of his boyhood visits now he must be well over a hundred but that piping voice could come from no one else he could distinguish no words yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable to think that old benijy should still be alivemister randy mister randy whar be ye dye want to skeer yer aunt marthy plumb to death haint she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in the arternoon an git back afur dark randy ran dee hes the beatinest boy fer runnin off in the woods i ever see haff the time asettin moonin raound that snakeden in the upper timberlot hey yew ran deerandolph carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes something was queer he had been somewhere he ought not to be had strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged and was now inexcusably late he had not noticed the time on the kingsport steeple though he could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented he was not sure he had his little telescope with him and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see no it was not there but there was the big silver key he had found in a box somewhere uncle chris had told him something odd once about an old unopened box with a key in it but aunt martha had stopped the story abruptly saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was already too full of queer fancies he tried to recall just where he had found the key but something seemed very confused he guessed it was in the attic at home in boston and dimly remembered bribing parks with half his weeks allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet about it but when he remembered this the face of parks came up very strangely as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk little cockneyran dee ran dee hi hi randya swaying lantern came around the black bend and old benijah pounced on the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrimdurn ye boy so thar

come mister randy or hannah wunt keep supper no longerso randolph carter was marched up the road where wondering stars glimmered through high autumn boughs and dogs barked as the yellow light of smallpaned windows shone out at the farther turn and the pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west aunt martha was in the doorway and did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in she knew uncle chris well enough to expect such things of the carter blood randolph did not shew his key but ate his supper in silence and protested only when bedtime came he sometimes dreamed better when awake and he wanted to use that keyin the morning randolph was up early and would have run off to the upper timberlot if uncle chris had not caught him and forced him into his chair by the breakfast table he looked impatiently around the lowpitched room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and cornerposts and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the leaded panes of the rear window the trees and the hills were close to him and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his true countrythen when he was free he felt in his blouse pocket for the key and being reassured skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond where the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless knoll the floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious and great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like druid monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove once in his ascent randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and aegipans and dryadsthen he came to the strange cave in the forest slope the dreaded snakeden which country folk shunned and away from which benijah had warned him again and again it was deep far deeper than anyone but randolph suspected for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyonda haunting sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious artifice on this occasion he crawled in as usual lighting his way with matches filched from the sittingroom matchsafe and edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself he could not tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as he did so but on he went and when he danced back to the house that night he offered no excuses for his lateness nor heeded in the least the reproofs he gained for ignoring the noontide dinnerhorn altogethernow it is agreed by all the distant relatives of randolph carter that something occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year his cousin ernest b aspinwall esq of chicago is fully ten years his senior and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn of 1883 randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can ever have beheld and stranger still were some of the qualities which he shewed in relation to very mundane things he seemed in fine to have picked up an odd gift of prophecy and reacted unusually to things which though at the time without meaning were later found to justify the singular impressions in subsequent decades as new inventions new names and new events appeared one by one in the book of history people would now and then recall wonderingly how carter had years before let fall some careless word of undoubted connexion with what was then far in the future he did not himself understand these words or know why certain things made him feel certain emotions but fancied that some unremembered dream must be responsible it was as early as 1897 that he turned pale when some traveller mentioned the french town of belloyensanterre and friends remembered it when he was almost mortally wounded there in 1916 while serving with the foreign legion in the great warcarters relatives talk much of these things because he has lately disappeared his little old servant parks who for years bore patiently with his vagaries last saw him on the morning he drove off alone in his car with a key he had recently found parks had helped him get the key from the old box containing it and had felt strangely affected by the grotesque carvings on the box and by some other odd quality he could not name when carter left he had said he was going to visit his old ancestral country around arkhamhalf way up elm mountain on the way to the ruins of the old carter place they found his motor set carefully by the roadside and in it was a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the countrymen who stumbled on it the box held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify rain had long effaced any possible footprints though boston investigators had something to say about evidences of disturbances among the fallen timbers of the carter place it was they averred as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period a common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond cannot be identified as belonging to the missing manthere is talk of apportioning randolph carters estate among his heirs but i shall stand firmly against this course because i do not believe he is dead there are twists of time and space of vision and reality which only a dreamer can divine and from what i know of carter i think he has merely found a way to traverse these mazes whether or not he will ever come back i cannot say he wanted the lands of dream he had lost and yearned for the days of his childhood then he found a key and i somehow believe he was able to use it to strange advantagei shall ask him when i see him for i expect to meet him shortly in a certain dreamcity we both used to haunt it is rumoured in ulthar beyond the river skai that a new king reigns on the opal throne in ilekvad that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny gnorri build their singular labyrinths and i believe i know how to interpret this rumour certainly i look forward impatiently to the sight of that great silver key for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolised all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos,1

i repeat to you gentlemen that your inquisition is fruitless detain me here forever if you will confine or execute me if you must have a victim to propitiate the illusion you call justice but i can say no more than i have said already everything that i can remember i have told with perfect candour nothing has been distorted or concealed and if anything remains vague it is only because of the dark cloud which has come over my mindthat cloud and the nebulous nature of the horrors which brought it upon meagain i say i do not know what has become of harley warren though i thinkalmost hopethat he is in peaceful oblivion if there be anywhere so blessed a thing it is true that i have for five years been his closest friend and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown i will not deny though my memory is uncertain and indistinct that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says on the gainesville pike walking toward big cypress swamp at half past eleven on that awful night that we bore electric lanterns spades and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments i will even affirm for these things all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection but of what followed and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning i must insist that i know nothing save what i have told you over and over again you say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode i reply that i know nothing beyond what i saw vision or nightmare it may have beenvision or nightmare i fervently hope it wasyet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the sight of men and why harley warren did not return he or his shadeor some namelessthingi cannot describealone can tellas i have said before the weird studies of harley warren were well known to me and to some extent shared by me of his vast collection of strange rare books on forbidden subjects i have read all that are written in the languages of which i am master but these are few as compared with those in languages i cannot understand most i believe are in arabic and the fiendinspired book which brought on the endthe book which he carried in his pocket out of the worldwas written in characters whose like i never saw elsewhere warren would never tell me just what was in that book as to the nature of our studiesmust i say again that i no longer retain full comprehension it seems to me rather merciful that i do not for they were terrible studies which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination warren always dominated me and sometimes i feared him i remember how i shuddered at his facial expression on the night before the awful happening when he talked so incessantly of his theorywhy certain corpses never decay but rest firm and fat in their tombs for a thousand yearsbut i do not fear him now for i suspect that he has known horrors beyond my ken now i fearforhimonce more i say that i have no clear idea of our object on that night certainly it had much to do with something in the book which warren carried with himthat ancient book in undecipherable characters which had come to him from india a month beforebut i swear i do not know what it was that we expected to find your witness says he saw us at half past eleven on the gainesville pike headed for big cypress swamp this is probably true but i have no distinct memory of it the picture seared into my soul is of one scene only and the hour must have been long after midnight for a waning crescent moon was high in the vaporous heavensthe place was an ancient cemetery so ancient that i trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years it was in a deep damp hollow overgrown with rank grass moss and curious creeping weeds and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone on every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude and i seemed haunted by the notion that warren and i were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries over the valleys rim a wan waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheardof catacombs and by its feeble wavering beams i could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs urns cenotaphs and mausolean facades all crumbling mossgrown and moisturestained and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation my first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with warren before a certain halfobliterated sepulchre and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying i now observed that i had with me an electric lantern and two spades whilst my companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit no word was uttered for the spot and the task seemed known to us and without delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass weeds and drifted earth from the flat archaic mortuary after uncovering the entire surface which consisted of three immense granite slabs we stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene and warren appeared to make some mental calculations then he returned to the sepulchre and using his spade as a lever sought to pry up the slab lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its day he did not succeed and motioned to me to come to his assistance finally our combined strength loosened the stone which we raised and tipped to one sidethe removal of the slab revealed a black aperture from which rushed an effluence of miasmal gases so nauseous that we started back in horror after an interval however we approached the pit again and found the exhalations less unbearable our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight of stone steps dripping with some detestable ichor of the inner earth and bordered by moist walls encrusted with nitre and now for the first time my memory records verbal discourse warren addressing me at length in his mellow tenor voice a voice singularly unperturbed by our awesome surroundingsim sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface he said but it would be a crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there you cant imagine even from what you have read and from what ive told you the things i shall have to see and do its fiendish work carter and i doubt if any man without ironclad sensibilities could ever see it through and come up alive and sane i dont wish to offend you and heaven knows id be glad enough to have you with me but the responsibility is in a certain sense mine and i couldnt drag a bundle of nerves like you down to probable death or madness i tell you you cant imagine what the thing is really like but i promise to keep you informed over the telephone of every moveyou see ive enough wire here to reach to the centre of the earth and backi can still hear in memory those coolly spoken words and i can still remember my remonstrances i seemed desperately anxious to accompany my friend into those sepulchral depths yet he proved inflexibly obdurate at one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if i remained insistent a threat which proved effective since he alone held the key to thethingall this i can still remember though i no longer know what manner ofthingwe sought after he had secured my reluctant acquiescence in his design warren picked up the reel of wire and adjusted the instruments at his nod i took one of the latter and seated myself upon an aged discoloured gravestone close by the newly uncovered aperture then he shook my hand shouldered the coil of wire and disappeared within that indescribable ossuary for a moment i kept sight of the glow of his lantern and heard the rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him but the glow soon disappeared abruptly as if a turn in the stone staircase had been encountered and the sound died away almost as quickly i was alone yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent moonin the lone silence of that hoary and deserted city of the dead my mind conceived the most ghastly phantasies and illusions and the grotesque shrines and monoliths seemed to assume a hideous personalitya halfsentience amorphous shadows seemed to lurk in the darker recesses of the weedchoked hollow and to flit as in some blasphemous ceremonial procession past the portals of the mouldering tombs in the hillside shadows which could not have been cast by that pallid peering crescent moon i constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing then a faint clicking came from the instrument and i called down to my friend in a tense voice apprehensive as i was i was nevertheless unprepared for the words which came up from that uncanny vault in accents more alarmed and quivering than any i had heard before from harley warren he who had so calmly left me a little while previously now called from below in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriekgod if you could see what i am seeingi could not answer speechless i could only wait then came the frenzied tones againcarter its terriblemonstrousunbelievablethis time my voice did not fail me and i poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions terrified i continued to repeat warren what is it what is itonce more came the voice of my friend still hoarse with fear and now apparently tinged with despairi cant tell you carter its too utterly beyond thoughti dare not tell youno man could know it and livegreat god i never dreamed of thisstillness again save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering inquiry then the voice of warren in a pitch of wilder consternationcarter for the love of god put back the slab and get out of this if you can quickleave everything else and make for the outsideits your only chance do as i say and dont ask me to explaini heard yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions around me were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows below me some peril beyond the radius of the human imagination but my friend was in greater danger than i and through my fear i felt a vague resentment that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such circumstances more clicking and after a pause a piteous cry from warrenbeat it for gods sake put back the slab and beat it cartersomething in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion unleashed my faculties i formed and shouted a resolution warren brace up im coming down but at this offer the tone of my auditor changed to a scream of utter despairdont you cant understand its too lateand my own fault put back the slab and runtheres nothing else you or anyone can do nowthe tone changed again this time acquiring a softer quality as of hopeless resignation yet it remained tense through anxiety for mequickbefore its too latei tried not to heed him tried to break through the paralysis which held me and to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid but his next whisper found me still held inert in the chains of stark horrorcarterhurry its no useyou must gobetter one than twothe slaba pause more clicking then the faint voice of warrennearly over nowdont make it hardercover up those damned steps and run for your lifeyoure losing time so long carterwont see you againhere warrens whisper swelled into a cry a cry that gradually rose to a shriek fraught with all the horror of the agescurse these hellish thingslegions my god beat it beat it beat itafter that was silence i know not how many interminable aeons i sat stupefied whispering muttering calling screaming into that telephone over and over again through those aeons i whispered and muttered called shouted and screamed warren warren answer meare you thereand then there came to me the crowning horror of allthe unbelievable unthinkable almost unmentionable thing i have said that aeons seemed to elapse after warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning and that only my own cries now broke the hideous silence but after a while there was a further clicking in the receiver and i strained my ears to listen again i called down warren are you there and in answer heard thethingwhich has brought this cloud over my mind i do not try gentlemen to account for thatthingthat voicenor can i venture to describe it in detail since the first words took away my consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of my awakening in the hospital shall i say that the voice was deep hollow gelatinous remote unearthly inhuman disembodied what shall i say it was the end of my experience and is the end of my story i heard it and knew no more heard it as i sat petrified in that unknown cemetery in the hollow amidst the crumbling stones and the falling tombs the rank vegetation and the miasmal vapours heard it well up from the innermost depths of that damnable open sepulchre as i watched amorphous necrophagous shadows dance beneath an accursed waning moon and this is what it saidyou fool warren is dead,1
in the morning mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond kingsport white and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan and later in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets the clouds scatter bits of those dreams that men shall not live without rumour of old strange secrets and wonders that planets tell planets alone in the night when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness as if the cliffs rim were the rim of all earth and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faerynow north of archaic kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious terrace on terrace till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a grey frozen windcloud alone it is a bleak point jutting in limitless space for there the coast turns sharp where the great miskatonic pours out of the plains past arkham bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories of new englands hills the seafolk in kingsport look up at that cliff as other seafolk look up at the polestar and time the nights watches by the way it hides or shews the great bear cassiopeia and the dragon among them it is one with the firmament and truly it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun some of the cliffs they love as that whose grotesque profile they call father neptune or that whose pillared steps they term the causeway but this one they fear because it is so near the sky the portuguese sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see it and the old yankees believe it would be a much graver matter than death to climb it if indeed that were possible nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff and at evening men see lights in the smallpaned windowsthe ancient house has always been there and people say one dwells therein who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep and perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliffs rim becomes the rim of all earth and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery this they tell from hearsay for that forbidding crag is always unvisited and natives dislike to train telescopes on it summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars but have never seen more than the grey primeval roof peaked and shingled whose eaves come nearly to the grey foundations and the dim yellow light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk these summer people do not believe that the same one has lived in the ancient house for hundreds of years but cannot prove their heresy to any real kingsporter even the terrible old man who talks to leaden pendulums in bottles buys groceries with centuried spanish gold and keeps stone idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in water street can only say these things were the same when his grandfather was a boy and that must have been inconceivable ages ago when belcher or shirley or pownall or bernard was governor of his majestys province of the massachusettsbaythen one summer there came a philosopher into kingsport his name was thomas olney and he taught ponderous things in a college by narragansett bay with stout wife and romping children he came and his eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many years and thinking the same welldisciplined thoughts he looked at the mists from the diadem of father neptune and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan steps of the causeway morning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the worlds rim at the cryptical aether beyond listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what might have been gulls then when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers he would sigh and descend to the town where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill and study the crazy tottering gables and odd pillared doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy seafolk and he even talked with the terrible old man who was not fond of strangers and was invited into his fearsomely archaic cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting soliloquies in the dark small hoursof course it was inevitable that olney should mark the grey unvisited cottage in the sky on that sinister northward crag which is one with the mists and the firmament always over kingsport it hung and always its mystery sounded in whispers through kingsports crooked alleys the terrible old man wheezed a tale that his father had told him of lightning that shot one nightup fromthat peaked cottage to the clouds of higher heaven and granny orne whose tiny gambrelroofed abode in ship street is all covered with moss and ivy croaked over something her grandmother had heard at secondhand about shapes that flapped out of the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that unreachable placefor the door is set close to the edge of the crag toward the ocean and glimpsed only from ships at seaat length being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the kingsporters fear nor the summer boarders usual indolence olney made a very terrible resolve despite a conservative trainingor because of it for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknownhe swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique grey cottage in the sky very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the miskatonics estuary probably they traded in arkham knowing how little kingsport liked their habitation or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the kingsport side olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope east and north it rose thousands of feet vertically from the water so only the western side inland and toward arkham remainedone early morning in august olney set out to find a path to the inaccessible pinnacle he worked northwest along pleasant back roads past hoopers pond and the old brick powderhouse to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the miskatonic and give a lovely vista of arkhams white georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow here he found a shady road to arkham but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished woods and fields crowded up to the high bank of the rivers mouth and bore not a sign of mans presence not even a stone wall or a straying cow but only the tall grass and giant trees and tangles of briers that the first indian might have seen as he climbed slowly east higher and higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea he found the way growing in difficulty till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside and whether they came often to market in arkhamthen the trees thinned and far below him on his right he saw the hills and antique roofs and spires of kingsport even central hill was a dwarf from this height and he could just make out the ancient graveyard by the congregational hospital beneath which rumour said some terrible caves or burrows lurked ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage now the ridge narrowed and olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky south of him the frightful precipice above kingsport north of him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the rivers mouth suddenly a great chasm opened before him ten feet deep so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall so this was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and skywhen he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering but he clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead walls as grey as the rock and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward vapours and he perceived that there was no door on this landward end but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy bullseye panes leaded in seventeenthcentury fashion all around him was cloud and chaos and he could see nothing below but the whiteness of illimitable space he was alone in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliffs edge so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the empty aether he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain and it was very odd that shingles so wormeaten could survive or bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimneyas the mist thickened olney crept around to the windows on the north and west and south sides trying them but finding them all locked he was vaguely glad they were locked because the more he saw of that house the less he wished to get in then a sound halted him he heard a lock rattle and bolt shoot and a long creaking follow as if a heavy door were slowly and cautiously opened this was on the oceanward side that he could not see where the narrow portal opened on blank space thousands of feet in the misty sky above the wavesthen there was heavy deliberate tramping in the cottage and olney heard the windows opening first on the north side opposite him and then on the west just around the corner next would come the south windows under the great low eaves on the side where he stood and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other when a fumbling came in the nearer casements he crept around to the west again flattening himself against the wall beside the now opened windows it was plain that the owner had come home but he had not come from the land nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined steps sounded again and olney edged round to the north but before he could find a haven a voice called softly and he knew he must confront his hoststuck out of a west window was a great blackbearded face whose eyes shone phosphorescently with the imprint of unheardof sights but the voice was gentle and of a quaint olden kind so that olney did not shudder when a brown hand reached out to help him over the sill and into that low room of black oak wainscots and carved tudor furnishings the man was clad in very ancient garments and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of sealore and dreams of tall galleons olney does not recall many of the wonders he told or even who he was but says that he was strange and kindly and filled with the magic of unfathomed voids of time and space the small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light and olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open but shut against the misty aether with dull thick panes like the bottoms of old bottlesthat bearded host seemed young yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries and from the tales of marvellous ancient things he related it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below and the day wore on and still olney listened to rumours of old times and far places and heard how the kings of atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in oceans floor and how the pillared and weedy temple of poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships who know by its sight that they are lost years of the titans were recalled but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the elder ones were born and when onlythe other godscame to dance on the peak of hathegkla in the stony desert near ulthar beyond the river skaiit was at this point that there came a knocking on the door that ancient door of nailstudded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud olney started in fright but the bearded man motioned him to be still and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peephole what he saw he did not like so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest then olney saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving and he was glad his host had not answered the knocking for there are strange objects in the great abyss and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong onesthen the shadows began to gather first little furtive ones under the table and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners and the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks frequently he would glance at the door as if he expected someone and at length his glance seemed answered by a singular rapping which must have followed some very ancient and secret code this time he did not even glance through the peephole but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt unlatching the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mistand then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room from the deep all the dreams and memories of earths sunken mighty ones and golden flames played about weedy locks so that olney was dazzled as he did them homage tridentbearing neptune was there and sportive tritons and fantastic nereids and upon dolphins backs was balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the grey and awful form of primal nodens lord of the great abyss and the conches of the tritons gave weird blasts and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black seacaves then hoary nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped olney and his host into the vast shell whereat the conches and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamour and out into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of thunderall night in kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists gave them glimpses of it and when toward the small hours the little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster and olneys children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of baptists and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning then dawn swam dripping and mistwreathed out of the sea and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether and at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as olney dry and lightfooted climbed down from the cliffs to antique kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes he could not recall what he had dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the terrible old man who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up and that somewhere under that grey peaked roof or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was thomas olneyand ever since that hour through dull dragging years of greyness and weariness the philosopher has laboured and eaten and slept and done uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea the sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow and welldisciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination his good wife waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful and he never fails to smile correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it in his glance there is not any restless light and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering he has never seen kingsport again for his family disliked the funny old houses and complained that the drains were impossibly bad they have a trim bungalow now at bristol highlands where no tall crags tower and the neighbours are urban and modernbut in kingsport strange tales are abroad and even the terrible old man admits a thing untold by his grandfather for now when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of kingsports maritime cotters and old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earths joys and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly they say too that the fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot shining blue in the north with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against wild coruscations and the mists of the dawn are thicker and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoysworst of all though is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of kingsports young men who grow prone to listen at night to the north winds faint distant sounds they swear no harm or pain can inhabit that high peaked cottage for in the new voices gladness beats and with them the tinkle of laughter and music what tales the seamists may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the cliffyawning door when clouds are thickest and patriarchs dread lest some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky and learn what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of kingsport that those venturesome youths will come back they do not doubt but they think a light may be gone from their eyes and a will from their hearts and they do not wish quaint kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the skiesthey do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant hearths and gambrelroofed taverns of old kingsport nor do they wish the laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder for as the voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea and from the north fresh lights so do they say that still other voices will bring more mists and more lights till perhaps the olden gods whose existence they hint only in whispers for fear the congregational parson shall hear may come out of the deep and from unknown kadath in the cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so close to the gentle hills and valleys of quiet simple fisherfolk this they do not wish for to plain people things not of earth are unwelcome and besides the terrible old man often recalls what olney said about a knock that the lone dweller feared and a shape seen black and inquisitive against the mist through those queer translucent windows of leaded bullseyesall these things however the elder ones only may decide and meanwhile the morning mist still comes up by that lonely vertiginous peak with the steep ancient house that grey loweaved house where none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north wind tells of strange revels white and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan and when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones then great eager vapours flock to heaven laden with lore and kingsport nestling uneasy on its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness as if the cliffs rim were the rim of all earth and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery,1
there be those who say that things and places have souls and there be those who say they have not i dare not say myself but i will tell of the streetmen of strength and honour fashioned that street good valiant men of our blood who had come from the blessed isles across the sea at first it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach then as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell they built cabins along the north side cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest for many indians lurked there with firearrows and in a few years more men built cabins on the south side of the streetup and down the street walked grave men in conical hats who most of the time carried muskets or fowling pieces and there were also their bonneted wives and sober children in the evening these men with their wives and children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak very simple were the things of which they read and spoke yet things which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue the forest and till the fields and the children would listen and learn of the laws and deeds of old and of that dear england which they had never seen or could not rememberthere was war and thereafter no more indians troubled the street the men busy with labour waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be and the children grew up comfortably and more families came from the mother land to dwell on the street and the childrens children and the newcomers children grew up the town was now a city and one by one the cabins gave place to houses simple beautiful houses of brick and wood with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors no flimsy creations were these houses for they were made to serve many a generation within there were carven mantels and graceful stairs and sensible pleasing furniture china and silver brought from the mother landso the street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its dwellers became more graceful and happy where once had been only strength and honour taste and learning now abode as well books and paintings and music came to the houses and the young men went to the university which rose above the plain to the north in the place of conical hats and muskets there were threecornered hats and smallswords and lace and snowy periwigs and there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitchingpoststhere were in that street many trees elms and oaks and maples of dignity so that in the summer the scene was all soft verdure and twittering birdsong and behind the houses were walled rosegardens with hedged paths and sundials where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dewso the street dreamed on past wars calamities and changes once most of the young men went away and some never came back that was when they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars but though men talked of great changes the street felt them not for its folk were still the same speaking of the old familiar things in the old familiar accents and the trees still sheltered singing birds and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the walled rosegardensin time there were no more swords threecornered hats or periwigs in the street how strange seemed the denizens with their walkingsticks tall beavers and cropped heads new sounds came from the distancefirst strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile away and then many years later strange puffings and shrieks and rumblings from other directions the air was not quite so pure as before but the spirit of the place had not changed the blood and soul of the people were as the blood and soul of their ancestors who had fashioned the street nor did the spirit change when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes or when they set up tall posts bearing weird wires there was so much ancient lore in that street that the past could not easily be forgottenthen came days of evil when many who had known the street of old knew it no more and many knew it who had not known it before and those who came were never as those who went away for their accents were coarse and strident and their mien and faces unpleasing their thoughts too fought with the wise just spirit of the street so that the street pined silently as its houses fell into decay and its trees died one by one and its rosegardens grew rank with weeds and waste but it felt a stir of pride one day when again marched forth young men some of whom never came back these young men were clad in bluewith the years worse fortune came to the street its trees were all gone now and its rosegardens were displaced by the backs of cheap ugly new buildings on parallel streets yet the houses remained despite the ravages of the years and the storms and worms for they had been made to serve many a generation new kinds of faces appeared in the street swarthy sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses pushcarts crowded the gutters a sordid undefinable stench settled over the place and the ancient spirit sleptgreat excitement once came to the street war and revolution were raging across the seas a dynasty had collapsed and its degenerate subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the western land many of these took lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the songs of birds and the scent of roses then the western land itself awoke and joined the mother land in her titanic struggle for civilisation over the cities once more floated the old flag companioned by the new flag and by a plainer yet glorious tricolour but not many flags floated over the street for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance again young men went forth but not quite as did the young men of those other days something was lacking and the sons of those young men of other days who did indeed go forth in olivedrab with the true spirit of their ancestors went from distant places and knew not the street and its ancient spiritover the seas there was a great victory and in triumph most of the young men returned those who had lacked something lacked it no longer yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street for many had stayed behind and many strangers had come from distant places to the ancient houses and the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers yet among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned the street and moulded its spirit like and yet unlike for there was in the eyes of all a weird unhealthy glitter as of greed ambition vindictiveness or misguided zeal unrest and treason were abroad amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the western land its deathblow that they might mount to power over its ruins even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy frozen land from whence most of them had come and the heart of that plotting was in the street whose crumbling houses teemed with alien makers of discord and echoed with the plans and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed day of blood flame and crimeof the various odd assemblages in the street the law said much but could prove little with great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and listen about such places as petrovitchs bakery the squalid rifkin school of modern economics the circle social club and the liberty caf there congregated sinister men in great numbers yet always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue and still the old houses stood with their forgotten lore of nobler departed centuries of sturdy colonial tenants and dewy rosegardens in the moonlight sometimes a lone poet or traveller would come to view them and would try to picture them in their vanished glory yet of such travellers and poets there were not manythe rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast band of terrorists who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter for the extermination of america and of all the fine old traditions which the street had loved handbills and papers fluttered about filthy gutters handbills and papers printed in many tongues and in many characters yet all bearing messages of crime and rebellion in these writings the people were urged to tear down the laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted to stamp out the soul of the old americathe soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a half years of anglosaxon freedom justice and moderation it was said that the swart men who dwelt in the street and congregated in its rotting edifices were the brains of a hideous revolution that at their word of command many millions of brainless besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities burning slaying and destroying till the land of our fathers should be no more all this was said and repeated and many looked forward in dread to the fourth day of july about which the strange writings hinted much yet could nothing be found to place the guilt none could tell just whose arrest might cut off the damnable plotting at its source many times came bands of bluecoated police to search the shaky houses though at last they ceased to come for they too had grown tired of law and order and had abandoned all the city to its fate then men in olivedrab came bearing muskets till it seemed as if in its sad sleep the street must have some haunting dreams of those other days when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach yet could no act be performed to check the impending cataclysm for the swart sinister men were old in cunningso the street slept uneasily on till one night there gathered in petrovitchs bakery and the rifkin school of modern economics and the circle social club and liberty caf and in other places as well vast hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation over hidden wires strange messages travelled and much was said of still stranger messages yet to travel but most of this was not guessed till afterward when the western land was safe from the peril the men in olivedrab could not tell what was happening or what they ought to do for the swart sinister men were skilled in subtlety and concealmentand yet the men in olivedrab will always remember that night and will speak of the street as they tell of it to their grandchildren for many of them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which they had expected it was known that this nest of anarchy was old and that the houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise because of its very queer uniformity it was indeed an exceedingly singular happening though after all a simple one for without warning in one of the small hours beyond midnight all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall nor did anything that had been alive come alive from the ruinsa poet and a traveller who came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene tell odd stories the poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins but indistinctly in the glare of the arclights that there loomed above the wreckage another picture wherein he could descry moonlight and fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity and the traveller declares that instead of the places wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom but are not the dreams of poets and the tales of travellers notoriously falsethere be those who say that things and places have souls and there be those who say they have not i dare not say myself but i have told you of the street,1

ridingcrop and kicking an unquestionably innocent cat who was also out strollingcurses he criedhardman not the cati am foiled in my plot to get the farm and the girl but jack manly shall never succeed

foiled close by the village lay a disreputable settlement of unkempt shacks populated by a shiftless scum who lived by thieving and other odd jobs here the devilish villain secured two accomplicesillfavoured fellows who were very clearly no gentlemen and in the night the evil three broke into the stubbs cottage and abducted the fair ermengarde taking her to a wretched hovel in the settlement and placing her under the charge of mother maria a hideous old hag farmer stubbs was quite distracted and would have advertised in the papers if the cost had been less than a cent a word for each insertion ermengarde was firm and never wavered in her refusal to wed the villainaha my proud beauty quoth he i have ye in me power and sooner or later i will break that will of thine meanwhile think of your poor old father and mother as turned out of hearth and home and wandering helpless through the meadowsoh spare them spare them said the maidenneverr ha ha ha ha leered the bruteand so the cruel days sped on while all in ignorance young jack manly was seeking fame and fortune in the great citychapter ivsubtle villainyone day as squire hardman sat in the front parlour of his expensive and palatial home indulging in his favourite pastime of gnashing his teeth and swishing his ridingcrop a great thought came to him and he cursed aloud at the statue of satan on the onyx mantelpiecefool that i am he cried why did i ever waste all this trouble on the girl when i can get the farm by simply foreclosing i never thought of that i will let the girl go take the farm and be free to wed some fair city maid like the leading lady of that burlesque troupe which played last week at the town halland so he went down to the settlement apologised to ermengarde let her go home and went home himself to plot new crimes and invent new modes of villainythe days wore on and the stubbses grew very sad over the coming loss of their home and still but nobody seemed able to do anything about it one day a party of hunters from the city chanced to stray over the old farm and one of them found the gold hiding his discovery from his companions he feigned rattlesnakebite and went to the stubbs cottage for aid of the usual kind ermengarde opened the door and saw him he also saw her and in that moment resolved to win her and the gold for my old mothers sake i musthe cried loudly to himself no sacrifice is too greatchapter vthe city chapalgernon reginald jones was a polished man of the world from the great city and in his sophisticated hands our poor little ermengarde was as a mere child one could almost believe that sixteenyearold stuff algy was a fast worker but never crude he could have taught hardman a thing or two about finesse in sheiking thus only a week after his advent to the stubbs family circle where he lurked like the vile serpent that he was he had persuaded the heroine to elope it was in the night that she went leaving a note for her parents sniffing the familiar mash for the last time and kissing the cat goodbyetouching stuff on the train algernon became sleepy and slumped down in his seat allowing a paper to fall out of his pocket by accident ermengarde taking advantage of her supposed position as a brideelect picked up the folded sheet and read its perfumed expansewhen lo she almost fainted it was a love letter from another womanperfidious deceiver she whispered at the sleeping algernon so this is all that your boasted fidelity amounts to i am done with you for all eternityso saying she pushed him out the window and settled down for a much needed restchapter vialone in the great citywhen the noisy train pulled into the dark station at the city poor helpless ermengarde was all alone without the money to get back to hogton oh why she sighed in innocent regret didnt i take his pocketbook before i pushed him out oh well i should worry he told me all about the city so i can easily earn enough to get home if not to pay off the mortgagebut alas for our little heroinework is not easy for a greenhorn to secure so for a week she was forced to sleep on park benches and obtain food from the breadline once a wily and wicked person perceiving her helplessness offered her a position as dishwasher in a fashionable and depraved cabaret but our heroine was true to her rustic ideals and refused to work in such a gilded and glittering palace of frivolityespecially since she was offered only 300 per week with meals but no board she tried to look up jack manly her onetime lover but he was nowhere to be found perchance too he would not have known her for in her poverty she had perforce become a brunette again and jack had not beheld her in that state since school days one day she found a neat but costly purse in the park and after seeing that there was not much in it took it to the rich lady whose card proclaimed her ownership delighted beyond words at the honesty of this forlorn waif the aristocratic mrs van itty adopted ermengarde to replace the little one who had been stolen from her so many years ago how like my precious maude she sighed as she watched the fair brunette return to blondeness and so several weeks passed with the old folks at home tearing their hair and the wicked squire hardman chuckling devilishlychapter viihappy ever afterwardone day the wealthy heiress ermengarde s van itty hired a new second assistant chauffeur struck by something familiar in his face she looked again and gasped lo it was none other than the perfidious algernon reginald jones whom she had pushed from a car window on that fateful day he had survivedthis much was almost immediately evident also he had wed the other woman who had run away with the milkman and all the money in the house now wholly humbled he asked forgiveness of our heroine and confided to her the whole tale of the gold on her fathers farm moved beyond words she raised his salary a dollar a month and resolved to gratify at last that always unquenchable anxiety to relieve the worry of the old folks so one bright day ermengarde motored back to hogton and arrived at the farm just as squire hardman was foreclosing the mortgage and ordering the old folks outstay villain she cried flashing a colossal roll of bills you are foiled at last here is your moneynow go and never darken our humble door againthen followed a joyous reunion whilst the squire twisted his moustache and ridingcrop in bafflement and dismay but hark what is this footsteps sound on the old gravel walk and who should appear but our hero jack manlyworn and seedy but radiant of face seeking at once the downcast villain he saidsquirelend me a tenspot will you i have just come back from the city with my beauteous bride the fair bridget goldstein and need something to start things on the old farm then turning to the stubbses he apologised for his inability to pay off the mortgage as agreeddont mention it said ermengarde prosperity has come to us and i will consider it sufficient payment if you will forget forever the foolish fancies of our childhoodall this time mrs van itty had been sitting in the motor waiting for ermengarde but as she lazily eyed the sharpfaced hannah stubbs a vague memory started from the back of her brain then it all came to her and she shrieked accusingly at the agrestic matronyouyouhannah smithi know you now twentyeight years ago you were my baby maudes nurse and stole her from the cradle where oh where is my child then a thought came as the lightning in a murky sky ermengardeyou say she isyourdaughter she is mine fate has restored to me my old cheeildmy tiny maudieermengardemaudecome to your mothers loving armsbut ermengarde was doing some tall thinking how could she get away with the sixteenyearold stuff if she had been stolen twentyeight years ago and if she was not stubbs daughter the gold would never be hers mrs van itty was rich but squire hardman was richer so approaching the dejected villain she inflicted upon him the last terrible punishmentsquire dear she murmured i have reconsidered all i love you and your naive strength marry me at once or i will have you prosecuted for that kidnapping last year foreclose your mortgage and enjoy with me the gold your cleverness discovered come dear and the poor dub didthe end,1
manuscript found on the coast of yucatanon august 20 1917 i karl heinrich graf von altbergehrenstein lieutenantcommander in the imperial german navy and in charge of the submarine u29 deposit this bottle and record in the atlantic ocean at a point to me unknown but probably about n latitude 20 w longitude 35 where my ship lies disabled on the ocean floor i do so because of my desire to set certain unusual facts before the public a thing i shall not in all probability survive to accomplish in person since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing as they are extraordinary and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the u29 but the impairment of my iron german will in a manner most disastrouson the afternoon of june 18 as reported by wireless to the u61 bound for kiel we torpedoed the british freightervictorynew york to liverpool in n latitude 45 16 w longitude 28 34 permitting the crew to leave in boats in order to obtain a good cinema view for the admiralty records the ship sank quite picturesquely bow first the stern rising high out of the water whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea our camera missed nothing and i regret that so fine a reel of film should never reach berlin after that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and submergedwhen we rose to the surface about sunset a seamans body was found on the deck hands gripping the railing in curious fashion the poor fellow was young rather dark and very handsome probably an italian or greek and undoubtedly of thevictorys crew he had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his ownone more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the english pigdogs are waging upon the fatherland our men searched him for souvenirs and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved to represent a youths head crowned with laurel my fellowofficer lieut klenze believed that the thing was of great age and artistic value so took it from the men for himself how it had ever come into the possession of a common sailor neither he nor i could imagineas the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which created much disturbance amongst the crew the fellows eyes had been closed but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred open and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed steadily and mockingly at schmidt and zimmer who were bent over the corpse the boatswain mller an elderly man who would have known better had he not been a superstitious alsatian swine became so excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water and swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming position and sped away to the south under the waves klenze and i did not like these displays of peasant ignorance and severely reprimanded the men particularly mllerthe next day a very troublesome situation was created by the indisposition of some of the crew they were evidently suffering from the nervous strain of our long voyage and had had bad dreams several seemed quite dazed and stupid and after satisfying myself that they were not feigning their weakness i excused them from their duties the sea was rather rough so we descended to a depth where the waves were less troublesome here we were comparatively calm despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts the moans of the sick men were decidedly annoying but since they did not appear to demoralise the rest of the crew we did not resort to extreme measures it was our plan to remain where we were and intercept the linerdaciamentioned in information from agents in new yorkin the early evening we rose to the surface and found the sea less heavy the smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon but our distance and ability to submerge made us safe what worried us more was the talk of boatswain mller which grew wilder as night came on he was in a detestably childish state and babbled of some illusion of dead bodies drifting past the undersea portholes bodies which looked at him intensely and which he recognised in spite of bloating as having seen dying during some of our victorious german exploits and he said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard was their leader this was very gruesome and abnormal so we confined mller in irons and had him soundly whipped the men were not pleased at his punishment but discipline was necessary we also denied the request of a delegation headed by seaman zimmer that the curious carved ivory head be cast into the seaon june 20 seamen bohm and schmidt who had been ill the day before became violently insane i regretted that no physician was included in our complement of officers since german lives are precious but the constant ravings of the two concerning a terrible curse were most subversive of discipline so drastic steps were taken the crew accepted the event in a sullen fashion but it seemed to quiet mller who thereafter gave us no trouble in the evening we released him and he went about his duties silentlyin the week that followed we were all very nervous watching for thedaciathe tension was aggravated by the disappearance of mller and zimmer who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears which had seemed to harass them though they were not observed in the act of jumping overboard i was rather glad to be rid of mller for even his silence had unfavourably affected the crew everyone seemed inclined to be silent now as though holding a secret fear many were ill but none made a disturbance lieut klenze chafed under the strain and was annoyed by the merest triflessuch as the school of dolphins which gathered about the u29 in increasing numbers and the growing intensity of that southward current which was not on our chartit at length became apparent that we had missed thedaciaaltogether such failures are not uncommon and we were more pleased than disappointed since our return to wilhelmshaven was now in order at noon june 28 we turned northeastward and despite some rather comical entanglements with the unusual masses of dolphins were soon under waythe explosion in the engine room at 2 pm was wholly a surprise no defect in the machinery or carelessness in the men had been noticed yet without warning the ship was racked from end to end with a colossal shock lieut klenze hurried to the engine room finding the fueltank and most of the mechanism shattered and engineers raabe and schneider instantly killed our situation had suddenly become grave indeed for though the chemical air regenerators were intact and though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship and opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries might hold out we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine to seek rescue in the lifeboats would be to deliver ourselves into the hands of enemies unreasonably embittered against our great german nation and our wireless had failed ever since thevictoryaffair to put us in touch with a fellow uboat of the imperial navyfrom the hour of the accident till july 2 we drifted constantly to the south almost without plans and encountering no vessel dolphins still encircled the u29 a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered on the morning of july 2 we sighted a warship flying american colours and the men became very restless in their desire to surrender finally lieut klenze had to shoot a seaman named traube who urged this ungerman act with especial violence this quieted the crew for the time and we submerged unseenthe next afternoon a dense flock of seabirds appeared from the south and the ocean began to heave ominously closing our hatches we awaited developments until we realised that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting waves our air pressure and electricity were diminishing and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender mechanical resources but in this case there was no choice we did not descend far and when after several hours the sea was calmer we decided to return to the surface here however a new trouble developed for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of all that the mechanics could do as the men grew more frightened at this undersea imprisonment some of them began to mutter again about lieut klenzes ivory image but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them we kept the poor devils as busy as we could tinkering at the machinery even when we knew it was uselessklenze and i usually slept at different times and it was during my sleep about 5 am july 4 that the general mutiny broke loose the six remaining pigs of seamen suspecting that we were lost had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the yankee battleship two days before and were in a delirium of cursing and destruction they roared like the animals they were and broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately screaming about such nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at them and swam away lieut klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient as one might expect of a soft womanish rhinelander i shot all six men for it was necessary and made sure that none remained alivewe expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the u29 klenze seemed very nervous and drank heavily it was decided that we remain alive as long as possible using the large stock of provisions and chemical supply of oxygen none of which had suffered from the crazy antics of those swinehound seamen our compasses depth gauges and other delicate instruments were ruined so that henceforth our only reckoning would be guesswork based on our watches the calendar and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we might spy through the portholes or from the conning tower fortunately we had storage batteries still capable of long use both for interior lighting and for the searchlight we often cast a beam around the ship but saw only dolphins swimming parallel to our own drifting course i was scientifically interested in those dolphins for though the ordinarydelphinus delphisis a cetacean mammal unable to subsist without air i watched one of the swimmers closely for two hours and did not see him alter his submerged conditionwith the passage of time klenze and i decided that we were still drifting south meanwhile sinking deeper and deeper we noted the marine fauna and flora and read much on the subject in the books i had carried with me for spare moments i could not help observing however the inferior scientific knowledge of my companion his mind was not prussian but given to imaginings and speculations which have no value the fact of our coming death affected him curiously and he would frequently pray in remorse over the men women and children we had sent to the bottom forgetting that all things are noble which serve the german state after a time he became noticeably unbalanced gazing for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost and forgotten things under the sea sometimes as a psychological experiment i would lead him on in these wanderings and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships i was very sorry for him for i dislike to see a german suffer but he was not a good man to die with for myself i was proud knowing how the fatherland would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be men like meon august 9 we espied the ocean floor and sent a powerful beam from the searchlight over it it was a vast undulating plain mostly covered with seaweed and strown with the shells of small molluscs here and there were slimy objects of puzzling contour draped with weeds and encrusted with barnacles which klenze declared must be ancient ships lying in their graves he was puzzled by one thing a peak of solid matter protruding above the ocean bed nearly four feet at its apex about two feet thick with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which met at a very obtuse angle i called the peak a bit of outcropping rock but klenze thought he saw carvings on it after a while he began to shudder and turned away from the scene as if frightened yet could give no explanation save that he was overcome with the vastness darkness remoteness antiquity and mystery of the oceanic abysses his mind was tired but i am always a german and was quick to notice two things that the u29 was standing the deepsea pressure splendidly and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us even at a depth where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible by most naturalists that i had previously overestimated our depth i was sure but none the less we must still be deep enough to make these phenomena remarkable our southward speed as gauged by the ocean floor was about as i had estimated from the organisms passed at higher levelsit was at 315 pm august 12 that poor klenze went wholly mad he had been in the conning tower using the searchlight when i saw him bound into the library compartment where i sat reading and his face at once betrayed him i will repeat here what he said underlining the words he emphasised heis callingheis calling i hear him we must go as he spoke he took his ivory image from the table pocketed it and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck in a moment i understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge with me into the water outside a vagary of suicidal and homicidal mania for which i was scarcely prepared as i hung back and attempted to soothe him he grew more violent saying come nowdo not wait until later it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be condemned then i tried the opposite of the soothing plan and told him he was madpitifully demented but he was unmoved and cried if i am mad it is mercy may the gods pity the man who in his callousness can remain sane to the hideous end come and be mad whilsthestill calls with mercythis outburst seemed to relieve a pressure in his brain for as he finished he grew much milder asking me to let him depart alone if i would not accompany him my course at once became clear he was a german but only a rhinelander and a commoner and he was now a potentially dangerous madman by complying with his suicidal request i could immediately free myself from one who was no longer a companion but a menace i asked him to give me the ivory image before he went but this request brought from him such uncanny laughter that i did not repeat it then i asked him if he wished to leave any keepsake or lock of hair for his family in germany in case i should be rescued but again he gave me that strange laugh so as he climbed the ladder i went to the levers and allowing proper timeintervals operated the machinery which sent him to his death after i saw that he was no longer in the boat i threw the searchlight around the water in an effort to obtain a last glimpse of him since i wished to ascertain whether the waterpressure would flatten him as it theoretically should or whether the body would be unaffected like those extraordinary dolphins i did not however succeed in finding my late companion for the dolphins were massed thickly and obscuringly about the conning towerthat evening i regretted that i had not taken the ivory image surreptitiously from poor klenzes pocket as he left for the memory of it fascinated me i could not forget the youthful beautiful head with its leafy crown though i am not by nature an artist i was also sorry that i had no one with whom to converse klenze though not my mental equal was much better than no one i did not sleep well that night and wondered exactly when the end would come surely i had little enough chance of rescuethe next day i ascended to the conning tower and commenced the customary searchlight explorations northward the view was much the same as it had been all the four days since we had sighted the bottom but i perceived that the drifting of the u29 was less rapid as i swung the beam around to the south i noticed that the ocean floor ahead fell away in a marked declivity and bore curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns the boat did not at once descend to match the greater ocean depth so i was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to cast a sharply downward beam owing to the abruptness of the change a wire was disconnected which necessitated a delay of many minutes for repairs but at length the light streamed on again flooding the marine valley below mei am not given to emotion of any kind but my amazement was very great when i saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow and yet as one reared in the bestkulturof prussia i should not have been amazed for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas what i saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices all of magnificent though unclassified architecture and in various stages of preservation most appeared to be of marble gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight and the general plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley with numerous isolated temples and villas on the steep slopes above roofs were fallen and columns were broken but there still remained an air of immemorially ancient splendour which nothing could effaceconfronted at last with the atlantis i had formerly deemed largely a myth i was the most eager of explorers at the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed for as i examined the scene more closely i beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and seawalls and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful in my enthusiasm i became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor klenze and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last allowing the u29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an aroplane settles upon a town of the upper earth i was slow too in realising that the school of unusual dolphins had vanishedin about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley on one side i could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down to the old riverbank on the other side in startling proximity i was confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building evidently a temple hollowed from the solid rock of the original workmanship of this titanic thing i can only make conjectures the facade of immense magnitude apparently covers a continuous hollow recess for its windows are many and widely distributed in the centre yawns a great open door reached by an impressive flight of steps and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures of bacchanals in relief foremost of all are the great columns and frieze both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty obviously portraying idealised pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god the art is of the most phenomenal perfection largely hellenic in idea yet strangely individual it imparts an impression of terrible antiquity as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of greek art nor can i doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet it is palpably a part of the valley wall though how the vast interior was ever excavated i cannot imagine perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fanefor fane indeed it must beand today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean chasmi cannot reckon the number of hours i spent in gazing at the sunken city with its buildings arches statues and bridges and the colossal temple with its beauty and mystery though i knew that death was near my curiosity was consuming and i threw the searchlights beam about in eager quest the shaft of light permitted me to learn many details but refused to shew anything within the gaping door of the rockhewn temple and after a time i turned off the current conscious of the need of conserving power the rays were now perceptibly dimmer than they had been during the weeks of drifting and as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light my desire to explore the watery secrets grew i a german should be the first to tread those aeonforgotten waysi produced and examined a deepsea diving suit of joined metal and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator though i should have trouble in managing the double hatches alone i believed i could overcome all obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk about the dead city in personon august 16 i effected an exit from the u29 and laboriously made my way through the ruined and mudchoked streets to the ancient river i found no skeletons or other human remains but gleaned a wealth of archaeological lore from sculptures and coins of this i cannot now speak save to utter my awe at a culture in the full noon of glory when cavedwellers roamed europe and the nile flowed unwatched to the sea others guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found must unfold the mysteries at which i can only hint i returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble resolved to explore the rock temple on the following dayon the 17th as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still more insistent a great disappointment befell me for i found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in july my rage was unbounded yet my german sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings i could never extricate myself all i could do was to turn on the waning searchlight of the u29 and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the exterior carvings the shaft of light entered the door at an upward angle and i peered in to see if i could glimpse anything but all in vain not even the roof was visible and though i took a step or two inside after testing the floor with a staff i dared not go farther moreover for the first time in my life i experienced the emotion of dread i began to realise how some of poor klenzes moods had arisen for as the temple drew me more and more i feared its aqueous abysses with a blind and mounting terror returning to the submarine i turned off the lights and sat thinking in the dark electricity must now be saved for emergenciessaturday the 18th i spent in total darkness tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my german will klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote and had advised me to go with him was indeed fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of clearly my nerves were sorely taxed and i must cast off these impressions of weaker meni could not sleep saturday night and turned on the lights regardless of the future it was annoying that the electricity should not last out the air and provisions i revived my thoughts of euthanasia and examined my automatic pistol toward morning i must have dropped asleep with the lights on for i awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find the batteries dead i struck several matches in succession and desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carriedafter the fading of the last match i dared to waste i sat very quietly without a light as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudderthe head of the radiant god in the sculptures on the rock temple is the same as that carven bit of ivory which the dead sailor brought from the sea and which poor klenze carried back into the seai was a little dazed by this coincidence but did not become terrified it is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and the complex by the primitive short cut of supernaturalism the coincidence was strange but i was too sound a reasoner to connect circumstances which admit of no logical connexion or to associate in any uncanny fashion the disastrous events which had led from thevictoryaffair to my present plight feeling the need of more rest i took a sedative and secured some more sleep my nervous condition was reflected in my dreams for i seemed to hear the cries of drowning persons and to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the boat and among the dead faces was the living mocking face of the youth with the ivory imagei must be careful how i record my awaking today for i am unstrung and much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact psychologically my case is most interesting and i regret that it cannot be observed scientifically by a competent german authority upon opening my eyes my first sensation was an overmastering desire to visit the rock temple a desire which grew every instant yet which i automatically sought to resist through some emotion of fear which operated in the reverse direction next there came to me the impression oflightamidst the darkness of dead batteries and i seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple this aroused my curiosity for i knew of no deepsea organism capable of emitting such luminosity but before i could investigate there came a third impression which because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might record it was an aural delusion a sensation of rhythmic melodic sound as of some wild yet beautiful chant or choral hymn coming from the outside through the absolutely soundproof hull of the u29 convinced of my psychological and nervous abnormality i lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium bromide solution which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling the illusion of sound but the phosphorescence remained and i had difficulty in repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and seek its source it was horribly realistic and i could soon distinguish by its aid the familiar objects around me as well as the empty sodium bromide glass of which i had had no former visual impression in its present location the last circumstance made me ponder and i crossed the room and touched the glass it was indeed in the place where i had seemed to see it now i knew that the light was either real or part of an hallucination so fixed and consistent that i could not hope to dispel it so abandoning all resistance i ascended to the conning tower to look for the luminous agency might it not actually be another uboat offering possibilities of rescueit is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth for since the events transcend natural law they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind when i attained the conning tower i found the sea in general far less luminous than i had expected there was no animal or vegetable phosphorescence about and the city that sloped down to the river was invisible in blackness what i did see was not spectacular not grotesque or terrifying yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my consciousnessfor the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance as from a mighty altarflame far withinlater incidents are chaotic as i stared at the uncannily lighted door and windows i became subject to the most extravagant visionsvisions so extravagant that i cannot even relate them i fancied that i discerned objects in the templeobjects both stationary and movingand seemed to hear again the unreal chant that had floated to me when first i awaked and over all rose thoughts and fears which centred in the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before me i thought of poor klenze and wondered where his body rested with the image he had carried back into the sea he had warned me of something and i had not heededbut he was a softheaded rhinelander who went mad at troubles a prussian could bear with easethe rest is very simple my impulse to visit and enter the temple has now become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately cannot be denied my own german will no longer controls my acts and volition is henceforward possible only in minor matters such madness it was which drove klenze to his death bareheaded and unprotected in the ocean but i am a prussian and a man of sense and will use to the last what little will i have when first i saw that i must go i prepared my diving suit helmet and air regenerator for instant donning and immediately commenced to write this hurried chronicle in the hope that it may some day reach the world i shall seal the manuscript in a bottle and entrust it to the sea as i leave the u29 foreveri have no fear not even from the prophecies of the madman klenze what i have seen cannot be true and i know that this madness of my own will at most lead only to suffocation when my air is gone the light in the temple is a sheer delusion and i shall die calmly like a german in the black and forgotten depths this daemoniac laughter which i hear as i write comes only from my own weakening brain so i will carefully don my diving suit and walk boldly up the steps into that primal shrine that silent secret of unfathomed waters and uncounted years,1
it was the design of angelo ricci and joe czanek and manuel silva to call on the terrible old man this old man dwells all alone in a very ancient house on water street near the sea and is reputed to be both exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble which forms a situation very attractive to men of the profession of messrs ricci czanek and silva for that profession was nothing less dignified than robberythe inhabitants of kingsport say and think many things about the terrible old man which generally keep him safe from the attention of gentlemen like mr ricci and his colleagues despite the almost certain fact that he hides a fortune of indefinite magnitude somewhere about his musty and venerable abode he is in truth a very strange person believed to have been a captain of east india clipper ships in his day so old that no one can remember when he was young and so taciturn that few know his real name among the gnarled trees in the front yard of his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large stones oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in some obscure eastern temple this collection frightens away most of the small boys who love to taunt the terrible old man about his long white hair and beard or to break the smallpaned windows of his dwelling with wicked missiles but there are other things which frighten the older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer in through the dusty panes these folk say that on a table in a bare room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles in each a small piece of lead suspended pendulumwise from a string and they say that the terrible old man talks to these bottles addressing them by such names as jack scarface long tom spanish joe peters and mate ellis and that whenever he speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum within makes certain definite vibrations as if in answer those who have watched the tall lean terrible old man in these peculiar conversations do not watch him again but angelo ricci and joe czanek and manuel silva were not of kingsport blood they were of that new and heterogeneous alien stock which lies outside the charmed circle of new england life and traditions and they saw in the terrible old man merely a tottering almost helpless greybeard who could not walk without the aid of his knotted cane and whose thin weak hands shook pitifully they were really quite sorry in their way for the lonely unpopular old fellow whom everybody shunned and at whom all the dogs barked singularly but business is business and to a robber whose soul is in his profession there is a lure and a challenge about a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank and who pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and silver minted two centuries agomessrs ricci czanek and silva selected the night of april 11th for their call mr ricci and mr silva were to interview the poor old gentleman whilst mr czanek waited for them and their presumable metallic burden with a covered motorcar in ship street by the gate in the tall rear wall of their hosts grounds desire to avoid needless explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these plans for a quiet and unostentatious departureas prearranged the three adventurers started out separately in order to prevent any evilminded suspicions afterward messrs ricci and silva met in water street by the old mans front gate and although they did not like the way the moon shone down upon the painted stones through the budding branches of the gnarled trees they had more important things to think about than mere idle superstition they feared it might be unpleasant work making the terrible old man loquacious concerning his hoarded gold and silver for aged seacaptains are notably stubborn and perverse still he was very old and very feeble and there were two visitors messrs ricci and silva were experienced in the art of making unwilling persons voluble and the screams of a weak and exceptionally venerable man can be easily muffled so they moved up to the one lighted window and heard the terrible old man talking childishly to his bottles with pendulums then they donned masks and knocked politely at the weatherstained oaken doorwaiting seemed very long to mr czanek as he fidgeted restlessly in the covered motorcar by the terrible old mans back gate in ship street he was more than ordinarily tenderhearted and he did not like the hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour appointed for the deed had he not told his colleagues to be as gentle as possible with the pathetic old seacaptain very nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivyclad stone wall frequently he consulted his watch and wondered at the delay had the old man died before revealing where his treasure was hidden and had a thorough search become necessary mr czanek did not like to wait so long in the dark in such a place then he sensed a soft tread or tapping on the walk inside the gate heard a gentle fumbling at the rusty latch and saw the narrow heavy door swing inward and in the pallid glow of the single dim streetlamp he strained his eyes to see what his colleagues had brought out of that sinister house which loomed so close behind but when he looked he did not see what he had expected for his colleagues were not there at all but only the terrible old man leaning quietly on his knotted cane and smiling hideously mr czanek had never before noticed the colour of that mans eyes now he saw that they were yellowlittle things make considerable excitement in little towns which is the reason that kingsport people talked all that spring and summer about the three unidentifiable bodies horribly slashed as with many cutlasses and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel bootheels which the tide washed in and some people even spoke of things as trivial as the deserted motorcar found in ship street or certain especially inhuman cries probably of a stray animal or migratory bird heard in the night by wakeful citizens but in this idle village gossip the terrible old man took no interest at all he was by nature reserved and when one is aged and feeble ones reserve is doubly strong besides so ancient a seacaptain must have witnessed scores of things much more stirring in the faroff days of his unremembered youth,1
iit is true that i have sent six bullets through the head of my best friend and yet i hope to shew by this statement that i am not his murderer at first i shall be called a madmanmadder than the man i shot in his cell at the arkham sanitarium later some of my readers will weigh each statement correlate it with the known facts and ask themselves how i could have believed otherwise than as i did after facing the evidence of that horrorthat thing on the doorstepuntil then i also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales i have acted on even now i ask myself whether i was misledor whether i am not mad after all i do not knowbut others have strange things to tell of edward and asenath derby and even the stolid police are at their wits ends to account for that last terrible visit they have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something infinitely more terrible and incredibleso i say that i have not murdered edward derby rather have i avenged him and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind there are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through when that happens the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequencesi have known edward pickman derby all his life eight years my junior he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and i sixteen he was the most phenomenal child scholar i have ever known and at seven was writing verse of a sombre fantastic almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering an only child he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side he was never allowed out without his nurse and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children all this doubtless fostered a strange secretive inner life in the boy with imagination as his one avenue of freedomat any rate his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age about that time i had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast and i found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit what lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was no doubt the ancient mouldering and subtly fearsome town in which we livedwitchcursed legendhaunted arkham whose huddled sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering miskatonicas time went by i turned to architecture and gave up my design of illustrating a book of edwards daemoniac poems yet our comradeship suffered no lessening young derbys odd genius developed remarkably and in his eighteenth year his collected nightmarelyrics made a real sensation when issued under the titleazathoth and other horrorshe was a close correspondent of the notorious baudelairean poet justin geoffrey who wrotethe people of the monolithand died screaming in a madhouse in 1926 after a visit to a sinister illregarded village in hungaryin selfreliance and practical affairs however derby was greatly retarded because of his coddled existence his health had improved but his habits of childish dependence were fostered by overcareful parents so that he never travelled alone made independent decisions or assumed responsibilities it was early seen that he would not be equal to a struggle in the business or professional arena but the family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy as he grew to years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness blond and blueeyed he had the fresh complexion of a child and his attempts to raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty his voice was soft and light and his pampered unexercised life gave him a juvenile chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age he was of good height and his handsome face would have made him a notable gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishnessderbys parents took him abroad every summer and he was quick to seize on the surface aspects of european thought and expression his poelike talents turned more and more toward the decadent and other artistic sensitivenesses and yearnings were halfaroused in him we had great discussions in those days i had been through harvard had studied in a boston architects office had married and had finally returned to arkham to practice my professionsettling in the family homestead in saltonstall st since my father had moved to florida for his health edward used to call almost every evening till i came to regard him as one of the household he had a characteristic way of ringing the doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal so that after dinner i always listened for the familiar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause less frequently i would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his constantly growing libraryderby went through miskatonic university in arkham since his parents would not let him board away from them he entered at sixteen and completed his course in three years majoring in english and french literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and the sciences he mingled very little with the other students though looking enviously at the daring or bohemian setwhose superficially smart language and meaninglessly ironic pose he aped and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adoptwhat he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean magical lore for which miskatonics library was and is famous always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness he now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity he read things like the frightfulbook of eibontheunaussprechlichen kultenof von junzt and the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred though he did not tell his parents he had seen them edward was twenty when my son and only child was born and seemed pleased when i named the newcomer edward derby upton after himby the time he was twentyfive edward derby was a prodigiously learned man and a fairly wellknown poet and fantaisiste though his lack of contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by making his products derivative and overbookish i was perhaps his closest friendfinding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents he remained singlemore through shyness inertia and parental protectiveness than through inclinationand moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent when the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home i went to plattsburg for a commission but never got overseasso the years wore on edwards mother died when he was thirtyfour and for months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady his father took him to europe however and he managed to pull out of his trouble without visible effects afterward he seemed to feel a sort of grotesque exhilaration as if of partial escape from some unseen bondage he began to mingle in the more advanced college set despite his middle age and was present at some extremely wild doingson one occasion paying heavy blackmail which he borrowed of me to keep his presence at a certain affair from his fathers notice some of the whispered rumours about the wild miskatonic set were extremely singular there was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond credibilityiiedward was thirtyeight when he met asenath waite she was i judge about twentythree at the time and was taking a special course in mediaeval metaphysics at miskatonic the daughter of a friend of mine had met her beforein the hall school at kingsportand had been inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation she was dark smallish and very goodlooking except for overprotuberant eyes but something in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people it was however largely her origin and conversation which caused average folk to avoid her she was one of the innsmouth waites and dark legends have clustered for generations about crumbling halfdeserted innsmouth and its people there are tales of horrible bargains about the year 1850 and of a strange element not quite human in the ancient families of the rundown fishing porttales such as only oldtime yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomenessasenaths case was aggravated by the fact that she was ephraim waites daughterthe child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went veiled ephraim lived in a halfdecayed mansion in washington street innsmouth and those who had seen the place arkham folk avoid going to innsmouth whenever they can declared that the attic windows were always boarded and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on the old man was known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day and legend averred that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim i had seen him once or twice in my youth as he came to arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the college library and had hated his wolfish saturnine face with its tangle of irongrey beard he had died insaneunder rather queer circumstancesjust before his daughter by his will made a nominal ward of the principal entered the hall school but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at timesthe friend whose daughter had gone to school with asenath waite repeated many curious things when the news of edwards acquaintance with her began to spread about asenath it seemed had posed as a kind of magician at school and had really seemed able to accomplish some highly baffling marvels she professed to be able to raise thunderstorms though her seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction all animals markedly disliked her and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand there were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very singularand very shockingfor a young girl when she would frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind and would seem to extract an obscene and zestful irony from her present situationmost unusual though were the wellattested cases of her influence over other persons she was beyond question a genuine hypnotist by gazing peculiarly at a fellowstudent she would often give the latter a distinct feeling ofexchanged personalityas if the subject were placed momentarily in the magicians body and able to stare half across the room at her real body whose eyes blazed and protruded with an alien expression asenath often made wild claims about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frameor at least from the lifeprocesses of the physical frame her crowning rage however was that she was not a man since she believed a male brain had certain unique and farreaching cosmic powers given a mans brain she declared she could not only equal but surpass her father in mastery of unknown forcesedward met asenath at a gathering of intelligentsia held in one of the students rooms and could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next day he had found her full of the interests and erudition which engrossed him most and was in addition wildly taken with her appearance i had never seen the young woman and recalled casual references only faintly but i knew who she was it seemed rather regrettable that derby should become so upheaved about her but i said nothing to discourage him since infatuation thrives on opposition he was not he said mentioning her to his fatherin the next few weeks i heard of very little but asenath from young derby others now remarked edwards autumnal gallantry though they agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age or seem at all inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity he was only a trifle paunchy despite his indolence and selfindulgence and his face was absolutely without lines asenath on the other hand had the premature crows feet which come from the exercise of an intense willabout this time edward brought the girl to call on me and i at once saw that his interest was by no means onesided she eyed him continually with an almost predatory air and i perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling soon afterward i had a visit from old mr derby whom i had always admired and respected he had heard the tales of his sons new friendship and had wormed the whole truth out of the boy edward meant to marry asenath and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs knowing my usually great influence with his son the father wondered if i could help to break the illadvised affair off but i regretfully expressed my doubts this time it was not a question of edwards weak will but of the womans strong will the perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image and nothing could be done about itthe wedding was performed a month laterby a justice of the peace according to the brides request mr derby at my advice offered no opposition and he my wife my son and i attended the brief ceremonythe other guests being wild young people from the college asenath had bought the old crowninshield place in the country at the end of high street and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to innsmouth whence three servants and some books and household goods were to be brought it was probably not so much consideration for edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college its library and its crowd of sophisticates that made asenath settle in arkham instead of returning permanently homewhen edward called on me after the honeymoon i thought he looked slightly changed asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache but there was more than that he looked soberer and more thoughtful his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness i was puzzled to decide whether i liked or disliked the change certainly he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before perhaps the marriage was a good thingmight not thechangeof dependence form a start toward actualneutralisationleading ultimately to responsible independence he came alone for asenath was very busy she had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from innsmouth derby shuddered as he spoke the name and was finishing the restoration of the crowninshield house and groundsher home inthat townwas a rather disquieting place but certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things he was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had asenaths guidance some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radicalhe did not feel at liberty to describe thembut he had confidence in her powers and intentions the three servants were very queeran incredibly aged couple who had been with old ephraim and referred occasionally to him and to asenaths dead mother in a cryptic way and a swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a perpetual odour of fishiiifor the next two years i saw less and less of derby a fortnight would sometimes slip by without the familiar threeandtwo strokes at the front door and when he did callor when as happened with increasing infrequency i called on himhe was very little disposed to converse on vital topics he had become secretive about those occult studies which he used to describe and discuss so minutely and preferred not to talk of his wife she had aged tremendously since her marriage till nowoddly enoughshe seemed the elder of the two her face held the most concentratedly determined expression i had ever seen and her whole aspect seemed to gain a vague unplaceable repulsiveness my wife and son noticed it as much as i and we all ceased gradually to call on herfor which edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless moments she was unmitigatedly grateful occasionally the derbys would go on long tripsostensibly to europe though edward sometimes hinted at obscurer destinationsit was after the first year that people began talking about the change in edward derby it was very casual talk for the change was purely psychological but it brought up some interesting points now and then it seemed edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature for examplealthough in the old days he could not drive a car he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old crowninshield driveway with asenaths powerful packard handling it like a master and meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed nature in such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on onewhat sort of trip no one could guess although he mostly favoured the innsmouth roadoddly the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing people said he looked too much like his wife or like old ephraim waite himself in these momentsor perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they were so rare sometimes hours after starting out in this way he would return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an obviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove also his preponderant aspect on the streets during his decreasing round of social contacts including i may say his calls on me was the oldtime indecisive oneits irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past while asenaths face aged edwardsaside from those exceptional occasionsactually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it it was really very puzzling meanwhile the derbys almost dropped out of the gay college circlenot through their own disgust we heard but because something about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadentsit was in the third year of the marriage that edward began to hint openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction he would let fall remarks about things going too far and would talk darkly about the need of saving his identity at first i ignored such references but in time i began to question him guardedly remembering what my friends daughter had said about asenaths hypnotic influence over the other girls at schoolthe cases where students had thought they were in her body looking across the room at themselves this questioning seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful and once he mumbled something about having a serious talk with me laterabout this time old mr derby died for which i was afterward very thankful edward was badly upset though by no means disorganised he had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage for asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family linkage some called him callous in his lossespecially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase he now wished to move back into the old derby mansion but asenath insisted on staying in the crowninshield house to which she had become well adjustednot long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friendone of the few who had not dropped the derbys she had been out to the end of high st to call on the couple and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with edwards oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel ringing the bell she had been told by the repulsive wench that asenath was also out but had chanced to look up at the house in leaving there at one of edwards library windows she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn facea face whose expression of pain defeat and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description it wasincredibly enough in view of its usual domineering castasenaths yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad muddled eyes of poor edward were gazing out from itedwards calls now grew a trifle more frequent and his hints occasionally became concrete what he said was not to be believed even in centuried and legendhaunted arkham but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity he talked about terrible meetings in lonely places of cyclopean ruins in the heart of the maine woods beneath which vast staircases lead down to abysses of nighted secrets of complex angles that lead through invisible walls to other regions of space and time and of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places on other worlds and in different spacetime continuahe would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly nonplussed meelusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no conceivable geometry these things he said came from outside and his wife knew how to get them sometimesbut always in frightened and ambiguous whispershe would suggest things about old ephraim waite whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days these adumbrations were never specific but seemed to revolve around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really deadin a spiritual as well as corporeal senseat times derby would halt abruptly in his revelations and i wondered whether asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance and cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerismsome power of the kind she had displayed at school certainly she suspected that he told me things for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his visits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency only with difficulty could he get to see me for although he would pretend to be going somewhere else some invisible force would generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the time being his visits usually came when asenath was awayaway in her own body as he once oddly put it she always found out laterthe servants watched his goings and comingsbut evidently she thought it inexpedient to do anything drasticivderby had been married more than three years on that august day when i got the telegram from maine i had not seen him for two months but had heard he was away on business asenath was supposed to be with him though watchful gossips declared there was someone upstairs in the house behind the doubly curtained windows they had watched the purchases made by the servants and now the town marshal of chesuncook had wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with delirious ravings and screamed to me for protection it was edwardand he had been just able to recall his own name and my name and addresschesuncook is close to the wildest deepest and least explored forest belt in maine and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car i found derby in a cell at the town farm vacillating between frenzy and apathy he knew me at once and began pouring out a meaningless halfincoherent torrent of words in my directiondanfor gods sake the pit of the shoggoths down the six thousand steps the abomination of abominations i never would let her take me and then i found myself there i shubniggurath the shape rose up from the altar and there were 500 that howled the hooded thing bleated kamog kamogthat was old ephraims secret name in the coven i was there where she promised she wouldnt take me a minute before i was locked in the library and then i was there where she had gone with my bodyin the place of utter blasphemy the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate i saw a shoggothit changed shape i cant stand it i wont stand it ill kill her if she ever sends me there again ill kill that entity her him it ill kill it ill kill it with my own handsit took me an hour to quiet him but he subsided at last the next day i got him decent clothes in the village and set out with him for arkham his fury of hysteria was spent and he was inclined to be silent though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed through augustaas if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories it was clear that he did not wish to go home and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wifedelusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been subjectedi thought it would be better if he did not i would i resolved put him up myself for a time no matter what unpleasantness it would make with asenath later i would help him get a divorce for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him when we struck open country again derbys muttering faded away and i let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as i droveduring our sunset dash through portland the muttering commenced again more distinctly than before and as i listened i caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about asenath the extent to which she had preyed on edwards nerves was plain for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her his present predicament he mumbled furtively was only one of a long series she was getting hold of him and he knew that some day she would never let go even now she probably let him go only when she had to because she couldnt hold on long at a time she constantly took his body and went to nameless places for nameless rites leaving him in her body and locking him upstairsbut sometimes she couldnt hold on and he would find himself suddenly in his own body again in some faroff horrible and perhaps unknown place sometimes shed get hold of him again and sometimes she couldnt often he was left stranded somewhere as i had found him time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances getting somebody to drive the car after he found itthe worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time she wanted to be a manto be fully humanthat was why she got hold of him she had sensed the mixture of finewrought brain and weak will in him some day she would crowd him out and disappear with his bodydisappear to become a great magician like her father and leave him marooned in that female shell that wasnt even quite human yes he knew about the innsmouth blood now there had been traffick with things from the seait was horrible and old ephraimhe had known the secret and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep alive he wanted to live forever asenath would succeedone successful demonstration had taken place alreadyas derby muttered on i turned to look at him closely verifying the impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me paradoxically he seemed in better shape than usualharder more normally developed and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his indolent habits it was as if he had been really active and properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life and i judged that asenaths force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of motion and alertness but just now his mind was in a pitiable state for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife about black magic about old ephraim and about some revelation which would convince even me he repeated names which i recognised from bygone browsings in forbidden volumes and at times made me shudder with a certain thread of mythological consistencyof convincing coherencewhich ran through his maundering again and again he would pause as if to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosuredan dan dont you remember himthe wild eyes and the unkempt beard that never turned white he glared at me once and i never forgot it nowsheglares that wayand i know whyhe found it in thenecronomiconthe formula i dont dare tell you the page yet but when i do you can read and understand then you will know what has engulfed me on on on onbody to body to bodyhe means never to die the lifeglowhe knows how to break the link it can flicker on a while even when the body is dead ill give you hints and maybe youll guess listen dando you know why my wife always takes such pains with that silly backhand writing have you ever seen a manuscript of old ephraims do you want to know why i shivered when i saw some hasty notes asenath had jotted downasenath is there such a personwhy did they half think there was poison in old ephraims stomach why do the gilmans whisper about the way he shriekedlike a frightened childwhen he went mad and asenath locked him up in the padded attic room wherethe otherhad beenwas it old ephraims soul that was locked in who locked in whomwhy had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a weak will why did he curse that his daughter wasnt a son tell me daniel uptonwhat devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting weakwilled halfhuman child at his mercydidnt he make it permanentas shell do in the end with me tell me why that thing that calls itself asenath writes differently when off guardso that you cant tell its script from then the thing happened derbys voice was rising to a thin treble scream as he raved when suddenly it was shut off with an almost mechanical click i thought of those other occasions at my home when his confidences had abruptly ceasedwhen i had half fancied that some obscure telepathic wave of asenaths mental force was intervening to keep him silent this though was something altogether differentand i felt infinitely more horrible the face beside me was twisted almost unrecognisably for a moment while through the whole body there passed a shivering motionas if all the bones organs muscles nerves and glands were readjusting themselves to a radically different posture set of stresses and general personalityjust where the supreme horror lay i could not for my life tell yet there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsionsuch a freezing petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormalitythat my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain the figure beside me seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous intrusion from outer spacesome damnable utterly accursed focus of unknown and malign cosmic forcesi had faltered only a moment but before another moment was over my companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him the dusk was now very thick and the lights of portland far behind so i could not see much of his face the blaze of his eyes though was phenomenal and i knew that he must now be in that queerly energised stateso unlike his usual selfwhich so many people had noticed it seemed odd and incredible that listless edward derbyhe who could never assert himself and who had never learned to driveshould be ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car yet that was precisely what had happened he did not speak for some time and in my inexplicable horror i was glad he did notin the lights of biddeford and saco i saw his firmly set mouth and shivered at the blaze of his eyes the people were righthe did look damnably like his wife and like old ephraim when in these moods i did not wonder that the moods were dislikedthere was certainly something unnatural and diabolic in them and i felt the sinister element all the more because of the wild ravings i had been hearing this man for all my lifelong knowledge of edward pickman derby was a strangeran intrusion of some sort from the black abysshe did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road and when he did his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar it was deeper firmer and more decisive than i had ever known it to be while its accent and pronunciation were altogether changedthough vaguely remotely and rather disturbingly recalling something i could not quite place there was i thought a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the timbrenot the flashy meaninglessly jaunty pseudoirony of the callow sophisticate which derby had habitually affected but something grim basic pervasive and potentially evil i marvelled at the selfpossession so soon following the spell of panicstruck mutteringi hope youll forget my attack back there upton he was saying you know what my nerves are and i guess you can excuse such things im enormously grateful of course for this lift homeand you must forget too any crazy things i may have been saying about my wifeand about things in general thats what comes from overstudy in a field like mine my philosophy is full of bizarre concepts and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of imaginary concrete applications i shall take a rest from now onyou probably wont see me for some time and you neednt blame asenath for itthis trip was a bit queer but its really very simple there are certain indian relics in the north woodsstanding stones and all thatwhich mean a good deal in folklore and asenath and i are following that stuff up it was a hard search so i seem to have gone off my head i must send somebody for the car when i get home a months relaxation will put me back on my feeti do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was for the baffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness with every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased till at length i was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel and i was glad of the speed with which portsmouth and newburyport flashed byat the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids innsmouth i was half afraid my driver would take the bleak shore road that goes through that damnable place he did not however but darted rapidly past rowley and ipswich toward our destination we reached arkham before midnight and found the lights still on at the old crowninshield house derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his thanks and i drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief it had been a terrible driveall the more terrible because i could not quite tell whyand i did not regret derbys forecast of a long absence from my companyvthe next two months were full of rumours people spoke of seeing derby more and more in his new energised state and asenath was scarcely ever in to her few callers i had only one visit from edward when he called briefly in asenaths carduly reclaimed from wherever he had left it in maineto get some books he had lent me he was in his new state and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks it was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this conditionand i noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old threeandtwo signal when ringing the doorbell as on that evening in the car i felt a faint infinitely deep horror which i could not explain so that his swift departure was a prodigious reliefin midseptember derby was away for a week and some of the decadent college set talked knowingly of the matterhinting at a meeting with a notorious cultleader lately expelled from england who had established headquarters in new york for my part i could not get that strange ride from maine out of my head the transformation i had witnessed had affected me profoundly and i caught myself again and again trying to account for the thingand for the extreme horror it had inspired in mebut the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old crowninshield house the voice seemed to be a womans and some of the younger people thought it sounded like asenaths it was heard only at rare intervals and would sometimes be choked off as if by force there was talk of an investigation but this was dispelled one day when asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a large number of acquaintancesapologising for her recent absences and speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a guest from boston the guest was never seen but asenaths appearance left nothing to be said and then someone complicated matters by whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a mans voiceone evening in midoctober i heard the familiar threeandtwo ring at the front door answering it myself i found edward on the steps and saw in a moment that his personality was the old one which i had not encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from chesuncook his face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion and he looked furtively over his shoulder as i closed the door behind himfollowing me clumsily to the study he asked for some whiskey to steady his nerves i forbore to question him but waited till he felt like beginning whatever he wanted to say at length he ventured some information in a choking voiceasenath has gone dan we had a long talk last night while the servants were out and i made her promise to stop preying on me of course i had certaincertain occult defences i never told you about she had to give in but got frightfully angry just packed up and started for new yorkwalked right out to catch the 820 in to boston i suppose people will talk but i cant help that you neednt mention that there was any troublejust say shes gone on a long research tripshes probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of devotees i hope shell go west and get a divorceanyhow ive made her promise to keep away and let me alone it was horrible danshe was stealing my bodycrowding me outmaking a prisoner of me i laid low and pretended to let her do it but i had to be on the watch i could plan if i was careful for she cant read my mind literally or in detail all she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood of rebellionand she always thought i was helpless never thought i could get the best of her but i had a spell or two that workedderby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskeyi paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back they were ugly about it and asked questions but they went theyre her kindinnsmouth peopleand were hand and glove with her i hope theyll let me alonei didnt like the way they laughed when they walked away i must get as many of dads old servants again as i can ill move back home nowi suppose you think im crazy danbut arkham history ought to hint at things that back up what ive told youand what im going to tell you youve seen one of the changes tooin your car after i told you about asenath that day coming home from maine that was when she got medrove me out of my body the last thing of the ride i remember was when i was all worked up trying to tell youwhat that shedevil isthen she got me and in a flash i was back at the housein the library where those damned servants had me locked upand in that cursed fiends body that isnt even human you know it was she you must have ridden home with that preying wolf in my body you ought to have known the differencei shuddered as derby paused surely ihadknown the differenceyet could i accept an explanation as insane as this but my distracted caller was growing even wilderi had to save myselfi had to dan shed have got me for good at hallowmassthey hold a sabbat up there beyond chesuncook and the sacrifice would have clinched things shed have got me for good shed have been i and id have been she forever too late my bodyd have been hers for good shed have been a man and fully human just as she wanted to be i suppose shed have put me out of the waykilled her own exbody with me in it damn herjust as she did beforejust as she he or it did before edwards face was now atrociously distorted and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a whisperyou must know what i hinted in the carthat she isnt asenath at all but really old ephraim himselfi suspected it a year and a half ago but i know it now her handwriting shews it when shes off guardsometimes she jots down a note in writing thats just like her fathers manuscripts stroke for strokeand sometimes she says things that nobody but an old man like ephraim could say he changed forms with her when he felt death comingshe was the only one he could find with the right kind of brain and a weak enough willhe got her body permanently just as she almost got mine and then poisoned the old body hed put her into havent you seen old ephraims soul glaring out of that shedevils eyes dozens of times and out of mine when she had control of my bodythe whisperer was panting and paused for breath i said nothing and when he resumed his voice was nearer normal this i reflected was a case for the asylum but i would not be the one to send him there perhaps time and freedom from asenath would do its work i could see that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism againill tell you more lateri must have a long rest now ill tell you something of the forbidden horrors she led me intosomething of the ageold horrors that even now are festering in outoftheway corners with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive some people know things about the universe that nobody ought to know and can do things that nobody ought to be able to do ive been in it up to my neck but thats the end today id burn that damnednecronomiconand all the rest if i were librarian at miskatonicbut she cant get me now i must get out of that accursed house as soon as i can and settle down at home youll help me i know if i need help those devilish servants you know and if people should get too inquisitive about asenath you see i cant give them her address then there are certain groups of searcherscertain cults you knowthat might misunderstand our breaking up some of them have damnably curious ideas and methods i know youll stand by me if anything happenseven if i have to tell you a lot that will shock you i had edward stay and sleep in one of the guestchambers that night and in the morning he seemed calmer we discussed certain possible arrangements for his moving back into the derby mansion and i hoped he would lose no time in making the change he did not call the next evening but i saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks we talked as little as possible about strange and unpleasant things but discussed the renovation of the old derby house and the travels which edward promised to take with my son and me the following summerof asenath we said almost nothing for i saw that the subject was a peculiarly disturbing one gossip of course was rife but that was no novelty in connexion with the strange mnage at the old crowninshield house one thing i did not like was what derbys banker let fall in an overexpansive mood at the miskatonic clubabout the cheques edward was sending regularly to a moses and abigail sargent and a eunice babson in innsmouth that looked as if those evilfaced servants were extorting some kind of tribute from himyet he had not mentioned the matter to mei wished that the summerand my sons harvard vacationwould come so that we could get edward to europe he was not i soon saw mending as rapidly as i had hoped he would for there was something a bit hysterical in his occasional exhilaration while his moods of fright and depression were altogether too frequent the old derby house was ready by december yet edward constantly put off moving though he hated and seemed to fear the crowninshield place he was at the same time queerly enslaved by it he could not seem to begin dismantling things and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action when i pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened his fathers old butlerwho was there with other reacquired family servantstold me one day that edwards occasional prowlings about the house and especially down cellar looked odd and unwholesome to him i wondered if asenath had been writing disturbing letters but the butler said there was no mail which could have come from herviit was about christmas that derby broke down one evening while calling on me i was steering the conversation toward next summers travels when he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of shocking uncontrollable frighta cosmic panic and loathing such as only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mindmy brain my brain god danits tuggingfrom beyondknockingclawingthat shedevileven nowephraimkamog kamogthe pit of the shoggothsi shubniggurath the goat with a thousand young the flamethe flame beyond body beyond life in the earth oh god i pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as his frenzy sank to a dull apathy he did not resist but kept his lips moving as if talking to himself presently i realised that he was trying to talk to me and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble words again again shes trying i might have known nothing can stop that force not distance nor magic nor death it comes and comes mostly in the night i cant leave its horrible oh god danif you only knew as i do just how horrible it is when he had slumped down into a stupor i propped him with pillows and let normal sleep overtake him i did not call a doctor for i knew what would be said of his sanity and wished to give nature a chance if i possibly could he waked at midnight and i put him to bed upstairs but he was gone by morning he had let himself quietly out of the houseand his butler when called on the wire said he was at home pacing restlessly about the libraryedward went to pieces rapidly after that he did not call again but i went daily to see him he would always be sitting in his library staring at nothing and having an air of abnormallisteningsometimes he talked rationally but always on trivial topics any mention of his trouble of future plans or of asenath would send him into a frenzy his butler said he had frightful seizures at night during which he might eventually do himself harmi had a long talk with his doctor banker and lawyer and finally took the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him the spasms that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiableand that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the arkham sanitarium i was made his guardian and called on him twice weeklyalmost weeping to hear his wild shrieks awesome whispers and dreadful droning repetitions of such phrases as i had to do iti had to do it itll get me itll get me down there down there in the dark mother mother dan save me save me how much hope of recovery there was no one could say but i tried my best to be optimistic edward must have a home if he emerged so i transferred his servants to the derby mansion which would surely be his sane choice what to do about the crowninshield place with its complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects i could not decide so left it momentarily untouchedtelling the derby housemaid to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those daysthe final nightmare came before candlemasheralded in cruel irony by a false gleam of hope one morning late in january the sanitarium telephoned to report that edwards reason had suddenly come back his continuous memory they said was badly impaired but sanity itself was certain of course he must remain some time for observation but there could be little doubt of the outcome all going well he would surely be free in a weeki hastened over in a flood of delight but stood bewildered when a nurse took me to edwards room the patient rose to greet me extending his hand with a polite smile but i saw in an instant that he bore the strangely energised personality which had seemed so foreign to his own naturethe competent personality i had found so vaguely horrible and which edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife there was the same blazing visionso like asenaths and old ephraimsand the same firm mouth and when he spoke i could sense the same grim pervasive irony in his voicethe deep irony so redolent of potential evil this was the person who had driven my car through the night five months beforethe person i had not seen since that brief call when he had forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in meand now he filled me with the same dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousnesshe spoke affably of arrangements for releaseand there was nothing for me to do but assent despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories yet i felt that something was terribly inexplicably wrong and abnormal there were horrors in this thing that i could not reach this was a sane personbut was it indeed the edward derby i had known if not who or what was itand where was edwardought it to be free or confined or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth there was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature saidthe asenathlike eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to certain words about the early liberty earned by anespecially close confinementi must have behaved very awkwardly and was glad to beat a retreatall that day and the next i racked my brain over the problem what had happened what sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in edwards face i could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work the second morning the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged and by evening i was close to a nervous collapsea state i admit though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision i have nothing to say on this point except that no madness of mine could account forallthe evidenceviiit was in the nightafter that second eveningthat stark utter horror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black clutching panic from which it can never shake free it began with a telephone call just before midnight i was the only one up and sleepily took down the receiver in the library no one seemed to be on the wire and i was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end was someone trying under great difficulties to talk as i listened i thought i heard a sort of halfliquid bubbling noiseglub glub glubwhich had an odd suggestion of inarticulate unintelligible word and syllable divisions i called who is it but the only answer wasglubglub glubglubi could only assume that the noise was mechanical but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive but not to send i added i cant hear you better hang up and try information immediately i heard the receiver go on the hook at the other endthis i say was just before midnight when that call was traced afterward it was found to come from the old crowninshield house though it was fully half a week from the housemaids day to be there i shall only hint what was found at that housethe upheaval in a remote cellar storeroom the tracks the dirt the hastily rifled wardrobe the baffling marks on the telephone the clumsily used stationery and the detestable stench lingering over everything the police poor fools have their smug little theories and are still searching for those sinister discharged servantswho have dropped out of sight amidst the present furore they speak of a ghoulish revenge for things that were done and say i was included because i was edwards best friend and adviseridiotsdo they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that handwriting do they fancy they could have brought what later came are they blind to the changes in that body that was edwards as for mei now believe all that edward derby ever told methere are horrors beyond lifes edge that we do not suspect and once in a while mans evil prying calls them just within our range ephraimasenaththat devil called them in and they engulfed edward as they are engulfing mecan i be sure that i am safe those powers survive the life of the physical form the next dayin the afternoon when i pulled out of my prostration and was able to walk and talk coherentlyi went to the madhouse and shot him dead for edwards and the worlds sake but can i be sure till he is cremated they are keeping the body for some silly autopsies by different doctorsbut i say he must be crematedhe must be crematedhe who was not edward derby when i shot himi shall go mad if he is not for i may be the next but my will is not weakand i shall not let it be undermined by the terrors i know are seething around it one lifeephraim asenath and edwardwho now iwill notbe driven out of my body iwill notchange souls with that bulletridden lich in the madhousebut let me try to tell coherently of that final horror i will not speak of what the police persistently ignoredthe tales of that dwarfed grotesque malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers in high st just before two oclock and the nature of the single footprints in certain places i will say only that just about two the doorbell and knocker waked medoorbell and knocker both plied alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperationand each trying to keep to edwards old signal of threeandtwo strokesroused from sound sleep my mind leaped into a turmoil derby at the doorand remembering the old code that new personality had not remembered it was edward suddenly back in his rightful state why was he here in such evident stress and haste had he been released ahead of time or had he escaped perhaps i thought as i flung on a robe and bounded downstairs his return to his own self had brought raving and violence revoking his discharge and driving him to a desperate dash for freedom whatever had happened he was good old edward again and i would help himwhen i opened the door into the elmarched blackness a gust of insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate i choked in nausea and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed humped figure on the steps the summons had been edwards but who was this foul stunted parody where had edward had time to go his ring had sounded only a second before the door openedthe caller had on one of edwards overcoatsits bottom almost touching the ground and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands on the head was a slouch hat pulled low while a black silk muffler concealed the face as i stepped unsteadily forward the figure made a semiliquid sound like that i had heard over the telephoneglub glub and thrust at me a large closely written paper impaled on the end of a long pencil still reeling from the morbid and unaccountable foetor i seized this paper and tried to read it in the light from the doorwaybeyond question it was in edwards script but why had he written when he was close enough to ringand why was the script so awkward coarse and shaky i could make out nothing in the dim half light so edged back into the hall the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but pausing on the inner doors threshold the odour of this singular messenger was really appalling and i hoped not in vain thank god that my wife would not wake and confront itthen as i read the paper i felt my knees give under me and my vision go black i was lying on the floor when i came to that accursed sheet still clutched in my fearrigid hand this is what it saiddango to the sanitarium and kill it exterminate it it isnt edward derby any more she got meits asenathand she has been dead three months and a halfi lied when i said she had gone away i killed her i had to it was sudden but we were alone and i was in my right body i saw a candlestick and smashed her head in she would have got me for good at hallowmassi buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and cleaned up all the traces the servants suspected next morning but they have such secrets that they dare not tell the police i sent them off but god knows what theyand others of the cultwill doi thought for a while i was all right and then i felt the tugging at my brain i knew what it wasi ought to have remembered a soul like hersor ephraimsis half detached and keeps right on after death as long as the body lasts she was getting memaking me change bodies with herseizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers buried in the cellari knew what was comingthats why i snapped and had to go to the asylum then it camei found myself choked in the darkin asenaths rotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where i put it and i knew she must be in my body at the sanitariumpermanentlyfor it was after hallowmass and the sacrifice would work even without her being theresane and ready for release as a menace to the world i was desperateand in spite of everything i clawed my way outim too far gone to talki couldnt manage to telephonebut i can still write ill get fixed up somehow and bring you this last word and warningkill that fiendif you value the peace and comfort of the worldsee that it is crematedif you dont it will live on and on body to body forever and i cant tell you what it will do keep clear of black magic dan its the devils business goodbyeyouve been a great friend tell the police whatever theyll believeand im damnably sorry to drag all this on you ill be at peace before longthis thing wont hold together much more hope you can read thisand kill that thingkill ityoursedit was only afterward that i read the last half of this paper for i had fainted at the end of the third paragraph i fainted again when i saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had struck it the messenger would not move or have consciousness any morethe butler tougherfibred than i did not faint at what met him in the hall in the morning instead he telephoned the police when they came i had been taken upstairs to bed but theother masslay where it had collapsed in the night the men put handkerchiefs to their noseswhat they finally found inside edwards oddly assorted clothes was mostly liquescent horror there were bones tooand a crushedin skull some dental work positively identified the skull as asenaths,1
iin a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and carpeted with bokhara rugs of impressive age and workmanship four men were sitting around a documentstrown table from the far corners where odd tripods of wroughtiron were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged negro in sombre livery came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum while in a deep niche on one side there ticked a curious coffinshaped clock whose dial bore baffling hieroglyphs and whose four hands did not move in consonance with any time system known on this planet it was a singular and disturbing room but well fitted to the business now at hand for here in the new orleans home of this continents greatest mystic mathematician and orientalist there was being settled at last the estate of a scarcely less great mystic scholar author and dreamer who had vanished from the face of the earth four years beforerandolph carter who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium and limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams and fabled avenues of other dimensions disappeared from the sight of man on the seventh of october 1928 at the age of fiftyfour his career had been a strange and lonely one and there were those who inferred from his curious novels many episodes more bizarre than any in his recorded history his association with harley warren the south carolina mystic whose studies in the primal naacal language of the himalayan priests had led to such outrageous conclusions had been close indeed it was he whoone mistmad terrible night in an ancient graveyardhad seen warren descend into a dank and nitrous vault never to emerge carter lived in boston but it was from the wild haunted hills behind hoary and witchaccursed arkham that all his forbears had come and it was amid those ancient cryptically brooding hills that he had ultimately vanishedhis old servant parkswho died early in 1930had spoken of the strangely aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic and of the undecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key which that box had contained matters of which carter had also written to others carter he said had told him that this key had come down from his ancestors and that it would help him to unlock the gate to his lost boyhood and to strange dimensions and fantastic realms which he had hitherto visited only in vague brief and elusive dreams then one day carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his car never to returnlater on people found the car at the side of an old grassgrown road in the hills behind crumbling arkhamthe hills where carters forbears had once dwelt and where the ruined cellar of the great carter homestead still gaped to the sky it was in a grove of tall elms near by that another of the carters had mysteriously vanished in 1781 and not far away was the halfrotted cottage where goody fowler the witch had brewed her ominous potions still earlier the region had been settled in 1692 by fugitives from the witchcraft trials in salem and even now it bore a name for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be envisaged edmund carter had fled from the shadow of gallows hill just in time and the tales of his sorceries were many now it seemed his lone descendant had gone somewhere to join himin the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood and the parchment which no man could read the silver key was gonepresumably with carter further than that there was no certain clue detectives from boston said that the fallen timbers of the old carter place seemed oddly disturbed and somebody found a handkerchief on the rockridged sinisterly wooded slope behind the ruins near the dreaded cave called the snakeden it was then that the country legends about the snakeden gained a new vitality farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old edmund carter the wizard had put that horrible grotto and added later tales about the fondness which randolph carter himself had had for it when a boy in carters boyhood the venerable gambrelroofed homestead was still standing and tenanted by his greatuncle christopher he had visited there often and had talked singularly about the snakeden people remembered what he had said about a deep fissure and an unknown inner cave beyond and speculated on the change he had shewn after spending one whole memorable day in the cavern when he was nine that was in october tooand ever after that he had seemed to have an uncanny knack at prophesying future eventsit had rained late in the night that carter vanished and no one was quite able to trace his footprints from the car inside the snakeden all was amorphous liquid mud owing to copious seepage only the ignorant rustics whispered about the prints they thought they spied where the great elms overhang the road and on the sinister hillside near the snakeden where the handkerchief was found who could pay attention to whispers that spoke of stubby little tracks like those which randolph carters squaretoed boots made when he was a small boy it was as crazy a notion as that other whisperthat the tracks of old benijah coreys peculiar heelless boots had met the stubby little tracks in the road old benijah had been the carters hired man when randolph was youngbut he had died thirty years agoit must have been these whispersplus carters own statement to parks and others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock the gate of his lost boyhoodwhich caused a number of mystical students to declare that the missing man had actually doubled back on the trail of time and returned through fortyfive years to that other october day in 1883 when he had stayed in the snakeden as a small boy when he came out that night they argued he had somehow made the whole trip to 1928 and backfor did he not thereafter know of things which were to happen later and yet he had never spoken of anything to happen after 1928one studentan elderly eccentric of providence rhode island who had enjoyed a long and close correspondence with carterhad a still more elaborate theory and believed that carter had not only returned to boyhood but achieved a further liberation roving at will through the prismatic vistas of boyhood dream after a strange vision this man published a tale of carters vanishing in which he hinted that the lost one now reigned as king on the opal throne of ilekvad that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny gnorri build their singular labyrinthsit was this old man ward phillips who pleaded most loudly against the apportionment of carters estate to his heirsall distant cousinson the ground that he was still alive in another timedimension and might well return some day against him was arrayed the legal talent of one of the cousins ernest b aspinwall of chicago a man ten years carters senior but keen as a youth in forensic battles for four years the contest had raged but now the time for apportionment had come and this vast strange room in new orleans was to be the scene of the arrangementsit was the home of carters literary and financial executorthe distinguished creole student of mysteries and eastern antiquities etiennelaurent de marigny carter had met de marigny during the war when they both served in the french foreign legion and had at once cleaved to him because of their similar tastes and outlook when on a memorable joint furlough the learned young creole had taken the wistful boston dreamer to bayonne in the south of france and had shewn him certain terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts that burrow beneath that brooding aeonweighted city the friendship was forever sealed carters will had named de marigny as executor and now that vivid scholar was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of the estate it was sad work for him for like the old rhodeislander he did not believe that carter was dead but what weight have the dreams of mystics against the harsh wisdom of the worldaround the table in that strange room in the old french quarter sat the men who claimed an interest in the proceedings there had been the usual legal advertisements of the conference in papers wherever carter heirs were thought to live yet only four now sat listening to the abnormal ticking of that coffinshaped clock which told no earthly time and to the bubbling of the courtyard fountain beyond halfcurtained fanlighted windows as the hours wore on the faces of the four were halfshrouded in the curling fumes from the tripods which piled recklessly with fuel seemed to need less and less attention from the silently gliding and increasingly nervous old negrothere was etienne de marigny himselfslim dark handsome moustached and still young aspinwall representing the heirs was whitehaired apoplecticfaced sidewhiskered and portly phillips the providence mystic was lean grey longnosed cleanshaven and stoopshouldered the fourth man was noncommittal in agelean and with a dark bearded singularly immobile face of very regular contour bound with the turban of a highcaste brahmin and having nightblack burning almost irisless eyes which seemed to gaze out from a vast distance behind the features he had announced himself as the swami chandraputra an adept from benares with important information to give and both de marigny and phillipswho had corresponded with himhad been quick to recognise the genuineness of his mystical pretensions his speech had an oddly forced hollow metallic quality as if the use of english taxed his vocal apparatus yet his language was as easy correct and idiomatic as any native anglosaxons in general attire he was the normal european civilian but his loose clothes sat peculiarly badly on him while his bushy black beard eastern turban and large white mittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricityde marigny fingering the parchment found in carters car was speakingno i have not been able to make anything of the parchment mr phillips here also gives it up col churchward declares it is not naacal and it looks nothing at all like the hieroglyphs on that easter island wooden club the carvings on that box though do strongly suggest easter island images the nearest thing i can recall to these parchment charactersnotice how all the letters seem to hang down from horizontal wordbarsis the writing in a book poor harley warren once had it came from india while carter and i were visiting him in 1919 and he never would tell us anything about it said it would be better if we didnt know and hinted that it might have come originally from some place other than the earth he took it with him in december when he went down into the vault in that old graveyardbut neither he nor the book ever came to the surface again some time ago i sent our friend herethe swami chandraputraa memorysketch of some of those letters and also a photostatic copy of the carter parchment he believes he may be able to shed light on them after certain references and consultationsbut the keycarter sent me a photograph of that its curious arabesques were not letters but seem to have belonged to the same culturetradition as the hieroglyphs on the parchment carter always spoke of being on the point of solving the mystery though he never gave details once he grew almost poetic about the whole business that antique silver key he said would unlock the successive doors that bar our free march down the mighty corridors of space and time to the very border which no man has crossed since shaddad with his terrific genius built and concealed in the sands of arabia petraea the prodigious domes and uncounted minarets of thousandpillared irem halfstarved dervisheswrote carterand thirstcrazed nomads have returned to tell of that monumental portal and of the hand that is sculptured above the keystone of the arch but no man has passed and returned to say that his footprints on the garnetstrown sands within bear witness to his visit the key he surmised was that for which the cyclopean sculptured hand vainly graspswhy carter didnt take the parchment as well as the key we cannot say perhaps he forgot itor perhaps he forbore to take it through recollection of one who had taken a book of like characters into a vault and never returned or perhaps it was really immaterial to what he wished to doas de marigny paused old mr phillips spoke in a harsh shrill voicewe can know of randolph carters wandering only what we dream i have been to many strange places in dreams and have heard many strange and significant things in ulthar beyond the river skai it does not appear that the parchment was needed for certainly carter rentered the world of his boyhood dreams and is now a king in ilekvadmr aspinwall grew doubly apoplecticlooking as he sputteredcant somebody shut that old fool up weve had enough of these moonings the problem is to divide the property and its about time we got to itfor the first time swami chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voicegentlemen there is more to this matter than you think mr aspinwall does not do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams mr phillips has taken an incomplete viewperhaps because he has not dreamed enough i myself have done much dreamingwe in india have always done that just as all the carters seem to have done it you mr aspinwall as a maternal cousin are naturally not a carter my own dreams and certain other sources of information have told me a great deal which you still find obscure for example randolph carter forgot that parchmentwhich he couldnt then decipheryet it would have been well for him had he remembered to take it you see i have really learned pretty much what happened to carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset on that seventh of october four years agoaspinwall audibly sneered but the others sat up with heightened interest the smoke from the tripods increased and the crazy ticking of that coffinshaped clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like the dots and dashes of some alien and insoluble telegraph message from outer space the hindoo leaned back half closed his eyes and continued in that oddly laboured yet idiomatic voice while before his audience there began to float a picture of what had happened to randolph carteriithe hills behind arkham are full of a strange magicsomething perhaps which the old wizard edmund carter called down from the stars and up from the crypts of nether earth when he fled there from salem in 1692 as soon as randolph carter was back among them he knew that he was close to one of the gates which a few audacious abhorred and aliensouled men have blasted through titan walls betwixt the world and the outside absolute here he felt and on this day of the year he could carry out with success the message he had deciphered months before from the arabesques of that tarnished and incredibly ancient silver key he knew now how it must be rotated how it must be held up to the setting sun and what syllables of ceremony must be intoned into the void at the ninth and last turning in a spot as close to a dark polarity and induced gate as this it could not fail in its primary function certainly he would rest that night in the lost boyhood for which he had never ceased to mournhe got out of the car with the key in his pocket walking uphill deeper and deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding haunted countryside of winding road vinegrown stone wall black woodland gnarled neglected orchard gapingwindowed deserted farmhouse and nameless ruin at the sunset hour when the distant spires of kingsport gleamed in the ruddy blaze he took out the key and made the needed turnings and intonations only later did he realise how soon the ritual had taken effectthen in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past old benijah corey his greatuncles hired man had not old benijah been dead for thirty years thirty years before when what was time where had he been why was it strange that benijah should be calling him on this seventh of october 1883 was he not out later than aunt martha had told him to stay what was this key in his blouse pocket where his little telescopegiven him by his father on his ninth birthday two months beforeought to be had he found it in the attic at home would it unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had traced amidst the jagged rocks at the back of that inner cave behind the snakeden on the hill that was the place they always coupled with old edmund carter the wizard people wouldnt go there and nobody but him had ever noticed or squirmed through the rootchoked fissure to that great black inner chamber with the pylon whose hands had carved that hint of a pylon out of the living rock old wizard edmundsorothersthat he had conjured up and commanded that evening little randolph ate supper with uncle chris and aunt martha in the old gambrelroofed farmhousenext morning he was up early and out through the twistedboughed apple orchard to the upper timberlot where the mouth of the snakeden lurked black and forbidding amongst grotesque overnourished oaks a nameless expectancy was upon him and he did not even notice the loss of his handkerchief as he fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the queer silver key was safe he crawled through the dark orifice with tense adventurous assurance lighting his way with matches taken from the sittingroom in another moment he had wriggled through the rootchoked fissure at the farther end and was in the vast unknown inner grotto whose ultimate rock wall seemed half like a monstrous and consciously shapen pylon before that dank dripping wall he stood silent and awestruck lighting one match after another as he gazed was that stony bulge above the keystone of the imagined arch really a gigantic sculptured hand then he drew forth the silver key and made motions and intonations whose source he could only dimly remember was anything forgotten he knew only that he wished to cross the barrier to the untrammelled land of his dreams and the gulfs where all dimensions dissolve in the absoluteiiiwhat happened then is scarcely to be described in words it is full of those paradoxes contradictions and anomalies which have no place in waking life but which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as matters of course till we return to our narrow rigid objective world of limited causation and tridimensional logic as the hindoo continued his tale he had difficulty in avoiding what seemedeven more than the notion of a man transferred through the years to boyhoodan air of trivial puerile extravagance mr aspinwall in disgust gave an apoplectic snort and virtually stopped listeningfor the rite of the silver key as practiced by randolph carter in that black haunted cave within a cave did not prove unavailing from the first gesture and syllable an aura of strange awesome mutation was apparenta sense of incalculable disturbance and confusion in time and space yet one which held no hint of what we recognise as motion and duration imperceptibly such things as age and location ceased to have any significance whatever the day before randolph carter had miraculously leaped a gulf of years now there was no distinction between boy and man there was only the entity randolph carter with a certain store of images which had lost all connexion with terrestrial scenes and circumstances of acquisition a moment before there had been an inner cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and gigantic sculptured hand on the farther wall now there was neither cave nor absence of cave neither wall nor absence of wall there was only a flux of impressions not so much visual as cerebral amidst which the entity that was randolph carter experienced perceptions or registrations of all that his mind revolved on yet without any clear consciousness of the way in which he received themby the time the rite was over carter knew that he was in no region whose place could be told by earths geographers and in no age whose date history could fix for the nature of what was happening was not wholly unfamiliar to him there were hints of it in the cryptical pnakotic fragments and a whole chapter in the forbiddennecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred had taken on significance when he had deciphered the designs graven on the silver key a gate had been unlockednot indeed the ultimate gate but one leading from earth and time to that extension of earth which is outside time and from which in turn the ultimate gate leads fearsomely and perilously to the last void which is outside all earths all universes and all matterthere would be a guideand a very terrible one a guide who had been an entity of earth millions of years before when man was undreamed of and when forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange cities among whose last crumbling ruins the earliest mammals were to play carter remembered what the monstrousnecronomiconhad vaguely and disconcertingly adumbrated concerning that guideand while there are those the mad arab had written who have dared to seek glimpses beyond the veil and to accept him as a guide they would have been more prudent had they avoided commerce with him for it is written in the book of thoth how terrific is the price of a single glimpse nor may those who pass ever return for in the vastnesses transcending our world are shapes of darkness that seize and bind the affair that shambleth about in the night the evil that defieth the elder sign the herd that stand watch at the secret portal each tomb is known to have and that thrive on that which groweth out of the tenants withinall these blacknesses are lesser than he who guardeth the gateway he who will guide the rash one beyond all the worlds into the abyss of unnamable devourers for he is umr attawil the most ancient one which the scribe rendereth as the prolonged of lifememory and imagination shaped dim halfpictures with uncertain outlines amidst the seething chaos but carter knew that they were of memory and imagination only yet he felt that it was not chance which built these things in his consciousness but rather some vast reality ineffable and undimensioned which surrounded him and strove to translate itself into the only symbols he was capable of grasping for no mind of earth may grasp the extensions of shape which interweave in the oblique gulfs outside time and the dimensions we knowthere floated before carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes which he somehow linked with earths primal aeonforgotten past monstrous living things moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic handiwork that no sane dream ever held and landscapes bore incredible vegetation and cliffs and mountains and masonry of no human pattern there were cities under the sea and denizens thereof and towers in great deserts where globes and cylinders and nameless winged entities shot off into space or hurtled down out of space all this carter grasped though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to him he himself had no stable form or position but only such shifting hints of form and position as his whirling fancy suppliedhe had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams where galleys sail up the river oukranos past the gilded spires of thran and elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in kled beyond forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon now intoxicated with wider visions he scarcely knew what he sought thoughts of infinite and blasphemous daring rose in his mind and he knew he would face the dreaded guide without fear asking monstrous and terrible things of himall at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind of stabilisation there were great masses of towering stone carven into alien and incomprehensible designs and disposed according to the laws of some unknown inverse geometry light filtered down from a sky of no assignable colour in baffling contradictory directions and played almost sentiently over what seemed to be a curved line of gigantic hieroglyphed pedestals more hexagonal than otherwise and surmounted by cloaked illdefined shapesthere was another shape too which occupied no pedestal but which seemed to glide or float over the cloudy floorlike lower level it was not exactly permanent in outline but held transient suggestions of something remotely preceding or paralleling the human form though half as large again as an ordinary man it seemed to be heavily cloaked like the shapes on the pedestals with some neutralcoloured fabric and carter could not detect any eyeholes through which it might gaze probably it did not need to gaze for it seemed to belong to an order of being far outside the merely physical in organisation and facultiesa moment later carter knew that this was so for the shape had spoken to his mind without sound or language and though the name it uttered was a dreaded and terrible one randolph carter did not flinch in fear instead he spoke back equally without sound or language and made those obeisances which the hideousnecronomiconhad taught him to make for this shape was nothing less than that which all the world has feared since lomar rose out of the sea and the winged ones came to earth to teach the elder lore to man it was indeed the frightful guide and guardian of the gateumr attawil the ancient one which the scribe rendereth the prolonged of lifethe guide knew as he knew all things of carters quest and coming and that this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid there was no horror or malignity in what he radiated and carter wondered for a moment whether the mad arabs terrific blasphemous hints and extracts from the book of thoth might not have come from envy and a baffled wish to do what was now about to be done or perhaps the guide reserved his horror and malignity for those who feared as the radiations continued carter mentally interpreted them in the form of wordsi am indeed that most ancient one said the guide of whom you know we have awaited youthe ancient ones and i you are welcome even though long delayed you have the key and have unlocked the first gate now the ultimate gate is ready for your trial if you fear you need not advance you may still go back unharmed the way you came but if you choose to advance the pause was ominous but the radiations continued to be friendly carter hesitated not a moment for a burning curiosity drove him oni will advance he radiated back and i accept you as my guideat this reply the guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his robe which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some homologous member a second sign followed and from his welllearnt lore carter knew that he was at last very close to the ultimate gate the light now changed to another inexplicable colour and the shapes on the quasihexagonal pedestals became more clearly defined as they sat more erect their outlines became more like those of men though carter knew that they could not be men upon their cloaked heads there now seemed to rest tall uncertainly coloured mitres strangely suggestive of those on certain nameless figures chiselled by a forgotten sculptor along the living cliffs of a high forbidden mountain in tartary while grasped in certain folds of their swathings were long sceptres whose carven heads bodied forth a grotesque and archaic mysterycarter guessed what they were whence they came and whom they served and guessed too the price of their service but he was still content for at one mighty venture he was to learn all damnation he reflected is but a word bandied about by those whose blindness leads them to condemn all who can see even with a single eye he wondered at the vast conceit of those who had babbled of themalignantancient ones as if they could pause from their everlasting dreams to wreak a wrath upon mankind as well he thought might a mammoth pause to visit frantic vengeance on an angleworm now the whole assemblage on the vaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him with a gesture of those oddly carven sceptres and radiating a message which he understoodwe salute you most ancient one and you randolph carter whose daring has made you one of uscarter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant and a gesture of the most ancient one told him it was reserved for him he saw also another pedestal taller than the rest and at the centre of the oddly curved line neither semicircle nor ellipse parabola nor hyperbola which they formed this he guessed was the guides own throne moving and rising in a manner hardly definable carter took his seat and as he did so he saw that the guide had likewise seated himselfgradually and mistily it became apparent that the most ancient one was holding somethingsome object clutched in the outflung folds of his robe as if for the sight or what answered for sight of the cloaked companions it was a large sphere or apparent sphere of some obscurely iridescent metal and as the guide put it forward a low pervasive halfimpression ofsoundbegan to rise and fall in intervals which seemed to be rhythmic even though they followed no rhythm of earth there was a suggestion of chantingor what human imagination might interpret as chanting presently the quasisphere began to grow luminous and as it gleamed up into a cold pulsating light of unassignable colour carter saw that its flickerings conformed to the alien rhythm of the chant then all the mitred sceptrebearing shapes on the pedestals commenced a slight curious swaying in the same inexplicable rhythm while nimbuses of unclassifiable lightresembling that of the quasisphereplayed round their shrouded headsthe hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall coffinshaped clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial whose crazy ticking followed no known rhythm of earthyou mr de marigny he suddenly said to his learned host do not need to be told the particular alien rhythm to which those cowled shapes on the hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded you are the only one elsein americawho has had a taste of the outer extension that clocki suppose it was sent you by the yogi poor harley warren used to talk aboutthe seer who said that he alone of living men had been to yianho the hidden legacy of sinister aeonold leng and had borne certain things away from that dreadful and forbidden city i wonder how many of its subtler properties you know if my dreams and readings be correct it was made by those who knew much of the first gateway but let me go on with my taleat last continued the swami the swaying and the suggestion of chanting ceased the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and motionless heads faded away while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on their pedestals the quasisphere however continued to pulsate with inexplicable light carter felt that the ancient ones were sleeping as they had been when he first saw them and he wondered out of what cosmic dreams his coming had wakened them slowly there filtered into his mind the truth that this strange chanting ritual had been one of instruction and that the companions had been chanted by the most ancient one into a new and peculiar kind of sleep in order that their dreams might open the ultimate gate to which the silver key was a passport he knew that in the profundity of this deep sleep they were contemplating unplumbed vastnesses of utter and absolute outsideness with which the earth had nothing to do and that they were to accomplish that which his presence had demandedthe guide did not share this sleep but seemed still to be giving instructions in some subtle soundless way evidently he was implanting images of those things which he wished the companions to dream and carter knew that as each of the ancient ones pictured the prescribed thought there would be born the nucleus of a manifestation visible to his own earthly eyes when the dreams of all the shapes had achieved a oneness that manifestation would occur and everything he required be materialised through concentration he had seen such things on earthin india where the combined projected will of a circle of adepts can make a thought take tangible substance and in hoary atlaant of which few men dare speakjust what the ultimate gate was and how it was to be passed carter could not be certain but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over him he was conscious of having a kind of body and of holding the fateful silver key in his hand the masses of towering stone opposite him seemed to possess the evenness of a wall toward the centre of which his eyes were irresistibly drawn and then suddenly he felt the mental currents of the most ancient one cease to flow forthfor the first time carter realised how terrific utter silence mental and physical may be the earlier moments had never failed to contain some perceptible rhythm if only the faint cryptical pulse of the earths dimensional extension but now the hush of the abyss seemed to fall upon everything despite his intimations of body he had no audible breath and the glow of umr attawils quasisphere had grown petrifiedly fixed and unpulsating a potent nimbus brighter than those which had played round the heads of the shapes blazed frozenly over the shrouded skull of the terrible guidea dizziness assailed carter and his sense of lost orientation waxed a thousandfold the strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the most impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses while about the ancient ones so close on their pseudohexagonal thrones there hovered an air of the most stupefying remoteness then he felt himself wafted into immeasurable depths with waves of perfumed warmth lapping against his face it was as if he floated in a torrid rosetinctured sea a sea of drugged wine whose waves broke foaming against shores of brazen fire a great fear clutched him as he half saw that vast expanse of surging sea lapping against its faroff coast but the moment of silence was brokenthe surgings were speaking to him in a language that was not of physical sound or articulate wordsthe man of truth is beyond good and evil intoned a voice that was not a voice the man of truth has ridden to allisone the man of truth has learnt that illusion is the only reality and that substance is an impostorand now in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so irresistibly drawn there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not unlike that which he thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave within a cave on the far unreal surface of the threedimensioned earth he realised that he had been using the silver keymoving it in accord with an unlearnt and instinctive ritual closely akin to that which had opened the inner gate that rosedrunken sea which lapped his cheeks was he realised no more or less than the adamantine mass of the solid wall yielding before his spell and the vortex of thought with which the ancient ones had aided his spell still guided by instinct and blind determination he floated forwardand through the ultimate gateivrandolph carters advance through that cyclopean bulk of abnormal masonry was like a dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the stars from a great distance he felt triumphant godlike surges of deadly sweetness and after that the rustling of great wings and impressions of sound like the chirpings and murmurings of objects unknown on earth or in the solar system glancing backward he saw not one gate alone but a multiplicity of gates at some of which clamoured forms he strove not to rememberand then suddenly he felt a greater terror than that which any of the forms could givea terror from which he could not flee because it was connected with himself even the first gateway had taken something of stability from him leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and about his relationship to the mistily defined objects around him but it had not disturbed his sense of unity he had still been randolph carter a fixed point in the dimensional seething now beyond the ultimate gateway he realised in a moment of consuming fright that he was not one person but many personshe was in many places at the same time on earth on october 7 1883 a little boy named randolph carter was leaving the snakeden in the hushed evening light and running down the rocky slope and through the twistedboughed orchard toward his uncle christophers house in the hills beyond arkhamyet at that same moment which was also somehow in the earthly year of 1928 a vague shadow not less randolph carter was sitting on a pedestal among the ancient ones in earths transdimensional extension here too was a third randolph carter in the unknown and formless cosmic abyss beyond the ultimate gate and elsewhere in a chaos of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and monstrous diversity brought him close to the brink of madness were a limitless confusion of beings which he knew were as much himself as the local manifestation now beyond the ultimate gatethere were carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected age of earths history and to remoter ages of earthly entity transcending knowledge suspicion and credibility carters of forms both human and nonhuman vertebrate and invertebrate conscious and mindless animal and vegetable and more there were carters having nothing in common with earthly life but moving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets and systems and galaxies and cosmic continua spores of eternal life drifting from world to world universe to universe yet all equally himself some of the glimpses recalled dreamsboth faint and vivid single and persistentwhich he had had through the long years since he first began to dream and a few possessed a haunting fascinating and almost horrible familiarity which no earthly logic could explainfaced with this realisation randolph carter reeled in the clutch of supreme horrorhorror such as had not been hinted even at the climax of that hideous night when two had ventured into an ancient and abhorred necropolis under a waning moon and only one had emerged no death no doom no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which flows from a loss ofidentitymerging with nothingness is peaceful oblivion but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no longer a definite being distinguished from other beingsthat one no longer has aselfthat is the nameless summit of agony and dreadhe knew that there had been a randolph carter of boston yet could not be sure whether hethe fragment or facet of an earthly entity beyond the ultimate gatehad been that one or some other hisselfhad been annihilated and yet heif indeed there could in view of that utter nullity of individual existence be such a thing ashewas equally aware of being in some inconceivable way a legion of selves it was as though his body had been suddenly transformed into one of those manylimbed and manyheaded effigies sculptured in indian temples and he contemplated the aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern which was the original and which the additionsif indeed supremely monstrous thought therewereany original as distinguished from other embodimentsthen in the midst of these devastating reflections carters beyondthegate fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of horror to black clutching pits of a horror still more profound this time it was largely externala force or personality which at once confronted and surrounded and pervaded him and which in addition to its local presence seemed also to be a part of himself and likewise to be coexistent with all time and coterminous with all space there was no visual image yet the sense of entity and the awful concept of combined localism identity and infinity lent a paralysing terror beyond anything which any carterfragment had hitherto deemed capable of existingin the face of that awful wonder the quasicarter forgot the horror of destroyed individuality it was an allinone and oneinall of limitless being and selfnot merely a thing of one spacetime continuum but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existences whole unbounded sweepthe last utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike it was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth have whispered of as yogsothoth and which has been a deity under other names that which the crustaceans of yuggoth worship as the beyondone and which the vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae know by an untranslatable signyet in a flash the carterfacet realised how slight and fractional all these conceptions areand now the being was addressing the carterfacet in prodigious waves that smote and burned and thundereda concentration of energy that blasted its recipient with wellnigh unendurable violence and that followed with certain definite variations the singular unearthly rhythm which had marked the chanting and swaying of the ancient ones and the flickering of the monstrous lights in that baffling region beyond the first gate it was as though suns and worlds and universes had converged upon one point whose very position in space they had conspired to annihilate with an impact of resistless fury but amidst the greater terror one lesser terror was diminished for the searing waves appeared somehow to isolate the beyondthegate carter from his infinity of duplicatesto restore as it were a certain amount of the illusion of identity after a time the hearer began to translate the waves into speechforms known to him and his sense of horror and oppression waned fright became pure awe and what had seemed blasphemously abnormal seemed now only ineffably majesticrandolph carter it seemed to say my manifestations on your planets extension the ancient ones have sent you as one who would lately have returned to small lands of dream which he had lost yet who with greater freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and curiosities you wished to sail up golden oukranos to search out forgotten ivory cities in orchidheavy kled and to reign on the opal throne of ilekvad whose fabulous towers and numberless domes rise mighty toward a single red star in a firmament alien to your earth and to all matter now with the passing of two gates you wish loftier things you would not flee like a child from a scene disliked to a dream beloved but would plunge like a man into that last and inmost of secrets which lies behind all scenes and dreamswhat you wish i have found good and i am ready to grant that which i have granted eleven times only to beings of your planetfive times only to those you call men or those resembling them i am ready to shew you the ultimate mystery to look on which is to blast a feeble spirit yet before you gaze full at that last and first of secrets you may still wield a free choice and return if you will through the two gates with the veil still unrent before your eyesva sudden shuttingoff of the waves left carter in a chilling and awesome silence full of the spirit of desolation on every hand pressed the illimitable vastness of the void yet the seeker knew that the being was still there after a moment he thought of words whose mental substance he flung into the abyssi accept i will not retreatthe waves surged forth again and carter knew that the being had heard and now there poured from that limitless mind a flood of knowledge and explanation which opened new vistas to the seeker and prepared him for such a grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess he was told how childish and limited is the notion of a tridimensional world and what an infinity of directions there are besides the known directions of updown forwardbackward rightleft he was shewn the smallness and tinsel emptiness of the little gods of earth with their petty human interests and connexionstheir hatreds rages loves and vanities their craving for praise and sacrifice and their demands for faith contrary to reason and naturewhile most of the impressions translated themselves to carter as words there were others to which other senses gave interpretation perhaps with eyes and perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a region of dimensions beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of man he saw now in the brooding shadows of that which had been first a vortex of power and then an illimitable void a sweep of creation that dizzied his senses from some inconceivable vantagepoint he looked upon prodigious forms whose multiple extensions transcended any conception of being size and boundaries which his mind had hitherto been able to hold despite a lifetime of cryptical study he began to understand dimly why there could exist at the same time the little boy randolph carter in the arkham farmhouse in 1883 the misty form on the vaguely hexagonal pillar beyond the first gate the fragment now facing the presence in the limitless abyss and all the other carters his fancy or perception envisagedthen the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his understanding reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his present fragment was an infinitesimal part they told him that every figure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of some corresponding figure of one more dimensionas a square is cut from a cube or a circle from a sphere the cube and sphere of three dimensions are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions that men know only through guesses and dreams and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity the world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thingthe threedimensional phase of that small wholeness reached by the first gate where umr attawil dictates dreams to the ancient ones though men hail it as reality and brand thoughts of its manydimensioned original as unreality it is in truth the very opposite that which we call substance and reality is shadow and illusion and that which we call shadow and illusion is substance and realitytime the waves went on is motionless and without beginning or end that it has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion indeed it is itself really an illusion for except to the narrow sight of beings in limited dimensions there are no such things as past present and future men think of time only because of what they call change yet that too is illusion all that was and is and is to be exists simultaneouslythese revelations came with a godlike solemnity which left carter unable to doubt even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension he felt that they must be true in the light of that final cosmic reality which belies all local perspectives and narrow partial views and he was familiar enough with profound speculations to be free from the bondage of local and partial conceptions had his whole quest not been based upon a faith in the unreality of the local and partialafter an impressive pause the waves continued saying that what the denizens of fewdimensioned zones call change is merely a function of their consciousness which views the external world from various cosmic angles as the shapes produced by the cutting of a cone seem to vary with the angles of cuttingbeing circle ellipse parabola or hyperbola according to that angle yet without any change in the cone itselfso do the local aspects of an unchanged and endless reality seem to change with the cosmic angle of regarding to this variety of angles of consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are slaves since with rare exceptions they cannot learn to control them only a few students of forbidden things have gained inklings of this control and have thereby conquered time and change but the entities outside the gates command all angles and view the myriad parts of the cosmos in terms of fragmentary changeinvolving perspective or of the changeless totality beyond perspective in accordance with their willas the waves paused again carter began to comprehend vaguely and terrifiedly the ultimate background of that riddle of lost individuality which had at first so horrified him his intuition pieced together the fragments of revelation and brought him closer and closer to a grasp of the secret he understood that much of the frightful revelation would have come upon himsplitting up his ego amongst myriads of earthly counterpartsinside the first gate had not the magic of umr attawil kept it from him in order that he might use the silver key with precision for the ultimate gates opening anxious for clearer knowledge he sent out waves of thought asking more of the exact relationship between his various facetsthe fragment now beyond the ultimate gate the fragment still on the quasihexagonal pedestal beyond the first gate the boy of 1883 the man of 1928 the various ancestral beings who had formed his heritage and the bulwark of his ego and the nameless denizens of the other aeons and other worlds which that first hideous flash of ultimate perception had identified with him slowly the waves of the being surged out in reply trying to make plain what was almost beyond the reach of an earthly mindall descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions continued the waves and all stages of growth in each one of these beings are merely manifestations of one archetypal and eternal being in the space outside dimensions each local beingson father grandfather and so onand each stage of individual beinginfant child boy young man old manis merely one of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and eternal being caused by a variation in the angle of the consciousnessplane which cuts it randolph carter at all ages randolph carter and all his ancestors both human and prehuman terrestrial and preterrestrial all these were only phases of one ultimate eternal carter outside space and timephantom projections differentiated only by the angle at which the plane of consciousness happened to cut the eternal archetype in each casea slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the child of yesterday could turn randolph carter into that wizard edmund carter who fled from salem to the hills behind arkham in 1692 or that pickman carter who in the year 2169 would use strange means in repelling the mongol hordes from australia could turn a human carter into one of those earlier entities which had dwelt in primal hyperborea and worshipped black plastic tsathoggua after flying down from kythanil the double planet that once revolved around arcturus could turn a terrestrial carter to a remotely ancestral and doubtfully shaped dweller on kythanil itself or a still remoter creature of transgalactic shonhi or a fourdimensioned gaseous consciousness in an older spacetime continuum or a vegetable brain of the future on a dark radioactive comet of inconceivable orbitand so on in the endless cosmic circlethe archetypes throbbed the waves are the people of the ultimate abyssformless ineffable and guessed at only by rare dreamers on the lowdimensioned worlds chief among such was this informing being itself which indeed was carters own archetypethe glutless zeal of carter and all his forbears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a natural result of derivation from the supreme archetype on every world all great wizards all great thinkers all great artists are facets of italmost stunned with awe and with a kind of terrifying delight randolph carters consciousness did homage to that transcendent entity from which it was derived as the waves paused again he pondered in the mighty silence thinking of strange tributes stranger questions and still stranger requests curious concepts flowed conflictingly through a brain dazed with unaccustomed vistas and unforeseen disclosures it occurred to him that if those disclosures were literally true he mightbodilyvisit all those infinitely distant ages and parts of the universe which he had hitherto known only in dreams could he but command the magic to change the angle of his consciousnessplane and did not the silver key supply that magic had it not first changed him from a man in 1928 to a boy in 1883 and then to something quite outside time oddly despite his present apparent absence of body he knew that the key was still with himwhile the silence still lasted randolph carter radiated forth the thoughts and questions which assailed him he knew that in this ultimate abyss he was equidistant from every facet of his archetypehuman or nonhuman earthly or extraearthly galactic or transgalactic and his curiosity regarding the other phases of his beingespecially those phases which were farthest from an earthly 1928 in time and space or which had most persistently haunted his dreams throughout lifewas at fever heat he felt that his archetypal entity could at will send him bodily to any of these phases of bygone and distant life by changing his consciousnessplane and despite the marvels he had undergone he burned for the further marvel of walking in the flesh through those grotesque and incredible scenes which visions of the night had fragmentarily brought himwithout definite intention he was asking the presence for access to a dim fantastic world whose five multicoloured suns alien constellations dizzy black crags clawed tapirsnouted denizens bizarre metal towers unexplained tunnels and cryptical floating cylinders had intruded again and again upon his slumbers that world he felt vaguely was in all the conceivable cosmos the one most freely in touch with others and he longed to explore the vistas whose beginnings he had glimpsed and to embark through space to those still remoter worlds with which the clawed snouted denizens trafficked there was no time for fear as at all crises of his strange life sheer cosmic curiosity triumphed over everything elsewhen the waves resumed their awesome pulsing carter knew that his terrible request was granted the being was telling him of the nighted gulfs through which he would have to pass of the unknown quintuple star in an unsuspected galaxy around which the alien world revolved and of the burrowing inner horrors against which the clawed snouted race of that world perpetually fought it told him too of how the angle of his personal consciousnessplane and the angle of his consciousnessplane regarding the spacetime elements of the soughtfor world would have to be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to that world the carterfacet which had dwelt therethe presence warned him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to return from the remote and alien world he had chosen and he radiated back an impatient affirmation confident that the silver key which he felt was with him and which he knew had tilted both world and personal planes in throwing him back to 1883 contained those symbols which were meant and now the being grasping his impatience signified its readiness to accomplish the monstrous precipitation the waves abruptly ceased and there supervened a momentary stillness tense with nameless and dreadful expectancythen without warning came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a terrific thundering once again carter felt himself the focal point of an intense concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared unbearably in the nowfamiliar alien rhythm of outer space and which he could not classify as either the blasting heat of a blazing star or the allpetrifying cold of the ultimate abyss bands and rays of colour utterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played and wove and interlaced before him and he was conscious of a frightful velocity of motion he caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sittingaloneupon a cloudy throne more hexagonal than otherwise vias the hindoo paused in his story he saw that de marigny and phillips were watching him absorbedly aspinwall pretended to ignore the narrative and kept his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him the alienrhythmed ticking of the coffinshaped clock took on a new and portentous meaning while the fumes from the choked neglected tripods wove themselves into fantastic and inexplicable shapes and formed disturbing combinations with the grotesque figures of the draughtswayed tapestries the old negro who had tended them was goneperhaps some growing tension had frightened him out of the house an almost apologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as he resumed in his oddly laboured yet idiomatic voiceyou have found these things of the abyss hard to believe he said but you will find the tangible and material things ahead still harder that is the way of our minds marvels are doubly incredible when brought into three dimensions from the vague regions of possible dream i shall not try to tell you muchthat would be another and very different story i will tell only what you absolutely have to knowcarter after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm had found himself in what for a moment he thought was his old insistent dream he was as many a night before walking amidst throngs of clawed snouted beings through the streets of a labyrinth of inexplicably fashioned metal under a blaze of diverse solar colour and as he looked down he saw that his body was like those of the othersrugose partly squamous and curiously articulated in a fashion mainly insectlike yet not without a caricaturish resemblance to the human outline the silver key was still in his graspthough held by a noxiouslooking clawin another moment the dreamsense vanished and he felt rather as one just awaked from a dream the ultimate abyssthe beingan entity of absurd outlandish race called randolph carter on a world of the future not yet bornsome of these things were parts of the persistent recurrent dreams of the wizard zkauba on the planet yaddith they were too persistentthey interfered with his duties in weaving spells to keep the frightful bholes in their burrows and became mixed up with his recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited in his lightbeam envelope and now they had become quasireal as never before this heavy material silver key in his right upper claw exact image of one he had dreamt about meant no good he must rest and reflect and consult the tablets of nhing for advice on what to do climbing a metal wall in a lane off the main concourse he entered his apartment and approached the rack of tabletsseven dayfractions later zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and halfdespair for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of memories nevermore could he know the peace of being one entity for all time and space he was two zkauba the wizard of yaddith disgusted with the thought of the repellent earthmammal carter that he was to be and had been and randolph carter of boston on the earth shivering with fright at the clawed snouted thing which he had once been and had become againthe timeunits spent on yaddith croaked the swamiwhose laboured voice was beginning to shew signs of fatiguemade a tale in themselves which could not be related in brief compass there were trips to shonhi and mthura and kath and other worlds in the twentyeight galaxies accessible to the lightbeam envelopes of the creatures of yaddith and trips back and forth through aeons of time with the aid of the silver key and various other symbols known to yaddiths wizards there were hideous struggles with the bleached viscous bholes in the primal tunnels that honeycombed the planet there were awed sessions in libraries amongst the massed lore of ten thousand worlds living and dead there were tense conferences with other minds of yaddith including that of the archancient buo zkauba told no one of what had befallen his personality but when the randolph carter facet was uppermost he would study furiously every possible means of returning to the earth and to human form and would desperately practice human speech with the buzzing alien throatorgans so ill adapted to itthe carterfacet had soon learned with horror that the silver key was unable to effect his return to human form it was as he deduced too late from things he remembered things he dreamed and things he inferred from the lore of yaddith a product of hyperborea on earth with power over the personal consciousnessangles of human beings alone it could however change the planetary angle and send the user at will through time in an unchanged body there had been an added spell which gave it limitless powers it otherwise lacked but this too was a human discoverypeculiar to a spatially unreachable region and not to be duplicated by the wizards of yaddith it had been written on the undecipherable parchment in the hideously carven box with the silver key and carter bitterly lamented that he had left it behind the now inaccessible being of the abyss had warned him to be sure of his symbols and had doubtless thought he lacked nothingas time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilise the monstrous lore of yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent entity with his new knowledge he could have done much toward reading the cryptic parchment but that power under present conditions was merely ironic there were times however when the zkaubafacet was uppermost and when he strove to erase the conflicting cartermemories which troubled himthus long spaces of time wore onages longer than the brain of man could grasp since the beings of yaddith die only after prolonged cycles after many hundred revolutions the carterfacet seemed to gain on the zkaubafacet and would spend vast periods calculating the distance of yaddith in space and time from the human earth that was to be the figures were staggeringaeons of lightyears beyond countingbut the immemorial lore of yaddith fitted carter to grasp such things he cultivated the power of dreaming himself momentarily earthward and learned many things about our planet that he had never known before but he could not dream the needed formula on the missing parchmentthen at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from yaddithwhich began when he found a drug that would keep his zkaubafacet always dormant yet without dissolution of the knowledge and memories of zkauba he thought that his calculations would let him perform a voyage with a lightwave envelope such as no being of yaddith had ever performedabodilyvoyage through nameless aeons and across incredible galactic reaches to the solar system and the earth itself once on earth though in the body of a clawed snouted thing he might be able somehow to findand finish decipheringthe strangely hieroglyphed parchment he had left in the car at arkham and with its aidand the keysresume his normal terrestrial semblancehe was not blind to the perils of the attempt he knew that when he had brought the planetangle to the right aeon a thing impossible to do while hurtling through space yaddith would be a dead world dominated by triumphant bholes and that his escape in the lightwave envelope would be a matter of grave doubt likewise was he aware of how he must achieve suspended animation in the manner of an adept to endure the aeonlong flight through fathomless abysses he knew too thatassuming his voyage succeededhe must immunise himself to the bacterial and other earthly conditions hostile to a body from yaddith furthermore he must provide a way of feigning human shape on earth until he might recover and decipher the parchment and resume that shape in truth otherwise he would probably be discovered and destroyed by the people in horror as a thing that should not be and there must be some goldluckily obtainable on yaddithto tide him over that period of questslowly carters plans went forward he provided a lightwave envelope of abnormal toughness able to stand both the prodigious timetransition and the unexampled flight through space he tested all his calculations and sent forth his earthward dreams again and again bringing them as close as possible to 1928 he practiced suspended animation with marvellous success he discovered just the bacterial agent he needed and worked out the varying gravitystress to which he must become used he artfully fashioned a waxen mask and loose costume enabling him to pass among men as a human being of a sort and devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back the bholes at the moment of his starting from the black dead yaddith of the inconceivable future he took care too to assemble a large supply of the drugsunobtainable on earthwhich would keep his zkaubafacet in abeyance till he might shed the yaddith body nor did he neglect a small store of gold for earthly usethe startingday was a time of doubt and apprehension carter climbed up to his envelopeplatform on the pretext of sailing for the triple star nython and crawled into the sheath of shining metal he had just room to perform the ritual of the silver key and as he did so he slowly started the levitation of his envelope there was an appalling seething and darkening of the day and a hideous racking of pain the cosmos seemed to reel irresponsibly and the other constellations danced in a black skyall at once carter felt a new equilibrium the cold of interstellar gulfs gnawed at the outside of his envelope and he could see that he floated free in spacethe metal building from which he had started having decayed ages before below him the ground was festering with gigantic bholes and even as he looked one reared up several hundred feet and levelled a bleached viscous end at him but his spells were effective and in another moment he was falling away from yaddith unharmedviiin that bizarre room in new orleans from which the old black servant had instinctively fled the odd voice of swami chandraputra grew hoarser stillgentlemen he continued i will not ask you to believe these things until i have shewn you special proof accept it then as a myth when i tell you of thethousands of lightyearsthousands of years of time and uncounted billions of milesthat randolph carter hurtled through space as a nameless alien entity in a thin envelope of electronactivated metal he timed his period of suspended animation with utmost care planning to have it end only a few years before the time of landing on the earth in or near 1928he will never forget that awakening remember gentlemen that before that aeonlong sleephe had lived consciously for thousands of terrestrial years amidst the alien and horrible wonders of yaddiththere was a hideous gnawing of cold a cessation of menacing dreams and a glance through the eyeplates of the envelope stars clusters nebulae on every handand at last their outlines bore some kinship to the constellations of earth that he knewsome day his descent into the solar system may be told he saw kynarth and yuggoth on the rim passed close to neptune and glimpsed the hellish white fungi that spot it learned an untellable secret from the closeglimpsed mists of jupiter and saw the horror on one of the satellites and gazed at the cyclopean ruins that sprawl over mars ruddy disc when the earth drew near he saw it as a thin crescent which swelled alarmingly in size he slackened speed though his sensations of homecoming made him wish to lose not a moment i will not try to tell you of those sensations as i learned them from carterwell toward the last carter hovered about in the earths upper air waiting till daylight came over the western hemisphere he wanted to land where he had leftnear the snakeden in the hills behind arkham if any of you have been away from home longand i know one of you hasi leave it to you how the sight of new englands rolling hills and great elms and gnarled orchards and ancient stone walls must have affected himhe came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old carter place and was thankful for the silence and solitude it was autumn as when he had left and the smell of the hills was balm to his soul he managed to drag the metal envelope up the slope of the timberlot into the snakeden though it would not go through the weedchoked fissure to the inner cave it was there also that he covered his alien body with the human clothing and waxen mask which would be necessary he kept the envelope here for over a year till certain circumstances made a new hidingplace necessaryhe walked to arkhamincidentally practicing the management of his body in human posture and against terrestrial gravityand got his gold changed to money at a bank he also made some inquiriesposing as a foreigner ignorant of much englishand found that the year was 1930 only two years after the goal he had aimed atof course his position was horrible unable to assert his identity forced to live on guard every moment with certain difficulties regarding food and with a need to conserve the alien drug which kept his zkaubafacet dormant he felt that he must act as quickly as possible going to boston and taking a room in the decaying west end where he could live cheaply and inconspicuously he at once established inquiries concerning randolph carters estate and effects it was then that he learned how anxious mr aspinwall here was to have the estate divided and how valiantly mr de marigny and mr phillips strove to keep it intactthe hindoo bowed though no expression crossed his dark tranquil and thickly bearded faceindirectly he continued carter secured a good copy of the missing parchment and began work on its deciphering i am glad to say that i was able to help in all thisfor he appealed to me quite early and through me came in touch with other mystics throughout the world i went to live with him in bostona wretched place in chambers st as for the parchmenti am pleased to help mr de marigny in his perplexity to him let me say that the language of those hieroglyphics is not naacal but rlyehian which was brought to earth by the spawn of cthulhu countless cycles ago it is of course a translationthere was an hyperborean original millions of years earlier in the primal tongue of tsathyothere was more to decipher than carter had looked for but at no time did he give up hope early this year he made great strides through a book he imported from nepal and there is no question but that he will win before long unfortunately however one handicap has developedthe exhaustion of the alien drug which keeps the zkaubafacet dormant this is not however as great a calamity as was feared carters personality is gaining in the body and when zkauba comes uppermostfor shorter and shorter periods and now only when evoked by some unusual excitementhe is generally too dazed to undo any of carters work he cannot find the metal envelope that would take him back to yaddith for although he almost did once carter hid it anew at a time when the zkaubafacet was wholly latent all the harm he has done is to frighten a few people and create certain nightmare rumours among the poles and lithuanians of bostons west end so far he has never injured the careful disguise prepared by the carterfacet though he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be replaced i have seen what lies beneathand it is not good to seea month ago carter saw the advertisement of this meeting and knew that he must act quickly to save his estate he could not wait to decipher the parchment and resume his human form consequently he deputed me to act for him and in that capacity i am heregentlemen i say to you that randolph carter is not dead that he is temporarily in an anomalous condition but that within two or three months at the outside he will be able to appear in proper form and demand the custody of his estate i am prepared to offer proof if necessary therefore i beg that you adjourn this meeting for an indefinite periodviiide marigny and phillips stared at the hindoo as if hypnotised while aspinwall emitted a series of snorts and bellows the old attorneys disgust had by now surged into open rage and he pounded the table with an apoplectically veined fist when he spoke it was in a kind of barkhow long is this foolery to be borne ive listened an hour to this madmanthis fakerand now he has the damned effrontery to say that randolph carter is aliveto ask us to postpone the settlement for no good reason why dont you throw the scoundrel out de marigny do you mean to make us all the butts of a charlatan or idiotde marigny quietly raised his hands and spoke softlylet us think slowly and clearly this has been a very singular tale and there are things in it which i as a mystic not altogether ignorant recognise as far from impossible furthermoresince 1930 i have received letters from the swami which tally with his accountas he paused old mr phillips ventured a wordswami chandraputra spoke of proofs i too recognise much that is significant in this story and i have myself had many oddly corroborative letters from the swami during the last two years but some of these statements are very extreme is there not something tangible which can be shewnat last the impassivefaced swami replied slowly and hoarsely and drawing an object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spokewhile none of you here has everseenthe silver key itself messrs de marigny and phillips have seen photographs of itdoes this look familiar to youhe fumblingly laid on the table with his large whitemittened hand a heavy key of tarnished silvernearly five inches long of unknown and utterly exotic workmanship and covered from end to end with hieroglyphs of the most bizarre description de marigny and phillips gaspedthats it cried de marigny the camera doesnt lie i couldnt be mistakenbut aspinwall had already launched a replyfools what does it prove if thats really the key that belonged to my cousin its up to this foreignerthis damned niggerto explain how he got it randolph carter vanished with the key four years ago how do we know he wasnt robbed and murdered he was halfcrazy himself and in touch with still crazier peoplelook here you niggerwhere did you get that key did you kill randolph carterthe swamis features abnormally placid did not change but the remote irisless black eyes behind them blazed dangerously he spoke with great difficultyplease control yourself mr aspinwall there is another form of proof that icouldgive but its effect upon everybody would not be pleasant let us be reasonable here are some papers obviously written since 1930 and in the unmistakable style of randolph carterhe clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed it to the sputtering attorney as de marigny and phillips watched with chaotic thoughts and a dawning feeling of supernal wonderof course the handwriting is almost illegiblebut remember that randolph carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human scriptaspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly and was visibly perplexed but he did not change his demeanour the room was tense with excitement and nameless dread and the alien rhythm of the coffinshaped clock had an utterly diabolic sound to de marigny and phillipsthough the lawyer seemed affected not at all aspinwall spoke againthese look like clever forgeries if they arent they may mean that randolph carter has been brought under the control of people with no good purpose theres only one thing to dohave this faker arrested de marigny will you telephone for the policelet us wait answered their host i do not think this case calls for the police i have a certain idea mr aspinwall this gentleman is a mystic of real attainments he says he is in the confidence of randolph carter will it satisfy you if he can answer certain questions which could be answered only by one in such confidence i know carter and can ask such questions let me get a book which i think will make a good testhe turned toward the door to the library phillips dazedly following in a kind of automatic way aspinwall remained where he was studying closely the hindoo who confronted him with abnormally impassive face suddenly as chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his pocket the lawyer emitted a guttural shout which stopped de marigny and phillips in their trackshey by god ive got it this rascal is in disguise i dont believe hes an east indian at all that faceit isnt a face but amaski guess his story put that into my head but its true it never moves and that turban and beard hide the edges this fellows a common crook he isnt even a foreignerive been watching his language hes a yankee of some sort and look at those mittenshe knows his fingerprints could be spotted damn you ill pull that thing offstop the hoarse oddly alien voice of the swami held a tone beyond all mere earthly fright i told you there wasanother form of proof which i could give if necessaryand i warned you not to provoke me to it this redfaced old meddler is rightim not really an east indianthis face is a mask and what it covers is not humanyou others have guessedi felt that minutes ago it wouldnt be pleasant if i took that mask offlet it alone ernest i may as well tell you thati am randolph carterno one moved aspinwall snorted and made vague motions de marigny and phillips across the room watched the workings of his red face and studied the back of the turbaned figure that confronted him the clocks abnormal ticking was hideous and the tripod fumes and swaying arras danced a dance of death the halfchoking lawyer broke the silenceno you dont you crookyou cant scare me youve reasons of your own for not wanting that mask off maybe wed know who you are off with itas he reached forward the swami seized his hand with one of his own clumsily mittened members evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and surprise de marigny started toward the two but paused confused as the pseudohindoos shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable rattling and buzzing sound aspinwalls red face was furious and with his free hand he made another lunge at his opponents bushy beard this time he succeeded in getting a hold and at his frantic tug the whole waxen visage came loose from the turban and clung to the lawyers apoplectic fistas it did so aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry and phillips and de marigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder deeper and more hideous epilepsy of stark panic than ever they had seen on human countenance before the pseudoswami had meanwhile released his other hand and was standing as if dazed making buzzing noises of a most abnormal quality then the turbaned figure slumped oddly into a posture scarcely human and began a curious fascinated sort of shuffle toward the coffinshaped clock that ticked out its cosmic and abnormal rhythm his now uncovered face was turned away and de marigny and phillips could not see what the lawyers act had disclosed then their attention was turned to aspinwall who was sinking ponderously to the floor the spell was brokenbut when they reached the old man he was deadturning quickly to the shuffling swamis receding back de marigny saw one of the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm the fumes of the olibanum were thick and all that could be glimpsed of the revealed hand was something long and black before the creole could reach the retreating figure old mr phillips laid a restraining hand on his shoulderdont he whispered we dont know what were up againstthat other facet you knowzkauba the wizard of yaddith the turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock and the watchers saw through the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with the tall hieroglyphed door the fumbling made a queer clicking sound then the figure entered the coffinshaped case and pulled the door shut after itde marigny could no longer be restrained but when he reached and opened the clock it was empty the abnormal ticking went on beating out the dark cosmic rhythm which underlies all mystical gateopenings on the floor the great white mitten and the dead man with a bearded mask clutched in his hand had nothing further to reveala year has passed and nothing has been heard of randolph carter his estate is still unsettled the boston address from which one swami chandraputra sent inquiries to various mystics in 19303132 was indeed tenanted by a strange hindoo but he left shortly before the date of the new orleans conference and has never been seen since he was said to be dark expressionless and bearded and his landlord thinks the swarthy maskwhich was duly exhibitedlooks very much like him he was never however suspected of any connexion with the nightmare apparitions whispered of by local slavs the hills behind arkham were searched for the metal envelope but nothing of the sort was ever found however a clerk in arkhams first national bank does recall a queer turbaned man who cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in october 1930de marigny and phillips scarcely know what to make of the business after all what was proved there was a story there was a key which might have been forged from one of the pictures carter had freely distributed in 1928 there were papersall indecisive there was a masked stranger but who now living saw behind the mask amidst the strain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing in the clock might easily have been a dual hallucination hindoos know much of hypnotism reason proclaims the swami a criminal with designs on randolph carters estate but the autopsy said that aspinwall had died of shock was it ragealonewhich caused it and some things in that story in a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with olibanum fumes etiennelaurent de marigny often sits listening with vague sensations to the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed coffinshaped clock,1
iupon an eroded clifftop rested the man gazing far across the valley lying thus he could see a great distance but in all the sere expanse there was no visible motion nothing stirred the dusty plain the disintegrated sand of longdry riverbeds where once coursed the gushing streams of earths youth there was little greenery in this ultimate world this final stage of mankinds prolonged presence upon the planet for unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had ravaged all the lands the trees and bushes had given way to small twisted shrubs that persisted long through their sturdiness but these in turn perished before the onslaught of coarse grasses and stringy tough vegetation of strange evolutionthe everpresent heat as earth drew nearer to the sun withered and killed with pitiless rays it had not come at once long aeons had gone before any could feel the change and all through those first ages mans adaptable form had followed the slow mutation and modelled itself to fit the more and more torrid air then the day had come when men could bear their hot cities but ill and a gradual recession began slow yet deliberate those towns and settlements closest to the equator had been first of course but later there were others man softened and exhausted could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat it seared him as he was and evolution was too slow to mould new resistances in himyet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the spider and the scorpion in the early years there were many who stayed on devising curious shields and armours against the heat and the deadly dryness these fearless souls screening certain buildings against the encroaching sun made miniature worlds of refuge wherein no protective armour was needed they contrived marvellously ingenious things so that for a while men persisted in the rusting towers hoping thereby to cling to old lands till the searing should be over for many would not believe what the astronomers said and looked for a coming of the mild olden world again but one day the men of dath from the new city of niyara made signals to yuanario their immemorially ancient capital and gained no answer from the few who remained therein and when explorers reached that millennial city of bridgelinked towers they found only silence there was not even the horror of corruption for the scavenger lizards had been swiftonly then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to them know that they must forever abandon them to nature the other colonists in the hot lands fled from their brave posts and total silence reigned within the high basalt walls of a thousand empty towns of the dense throngs and multitudinous activities of the past nothing finally remained there now loomed against the rainless deserts only the blistered towers of vacant houses factories and structures of every sort reflecting the suns dazzling radiance and parching in the more and more intolerable heatmany lands however had still escaped the scorching blight so that the refugees were soon absorbed in the life of a newer world during strangely prosperous centuries the hoary deserted cities of the equator grew halfforgotten and entwined with fantastic fables few thought of those spectral rotting towers those huddles of shabby walls and cactuschoked streets darkly silent and abandoned wars came sinful and prolonged but the times of peace were greater yet always the swollen sun increased its radiance as earth drew closer to its fiery parent it was as if the planet meant to return to that source whence it was snatched aeons ago through the accidents of cosmic growthafter a time the blight crept outward from the central belt southern yarat burned as a tenantless desertand then the north in perath and baling those ancient cities where brooding centuries dwelt there moved only the scaly shapes of the serpent and the salamander and at last loton echoed only to the fitful falling of tottering spires and crumbling domessteady universal and inexorable was the great eviction of man from the realms he had always known no land within the widening stricken belt was spared no people left unrouted it was an epic a titan tragedy whose plot was unrevealed to the actorsthis wholesale desertion of the cities of men it took not years or even centuries but millennia of ruthless change and still it kept onsullen inevitable savagely devastatingagriculture was at a standstill the world fast became too arid for crops this was remedied by artificial substitutes soon universally used and as the old places that had known the great things of mortals were left the loot salvaged by the fugitives grew smaller and smaller things of the greatest value and importance were left in dead museumslost amid the centuriesand in the end the heritage of the immemorial past was abandoned a degeneracy both physical and cultural set in with the insidious heat for man had so long dwelt in comfort and security that this exodus from past scenes was difficult nor were these events received phlegmatically their very slowness was terrifying degradation and debauchery were soon common government was disorganized and the civilizations aimlessly slid back toward barbarismwhen fortynine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt the whole western hemisphere was left unpeopled chaos was complete there was no trace of order or decency in the last scenes of this titanic wildly impressive migration madness and frenzy stalked through them and fanatics screamed of an armageddon close at handmankind was now a pitiful remnant of the elder races a fugitive not only from the prevailing conditions but from his own degeneracy into the northland and the antarctic went those who could the rest lingered for years in an incredible saturnalia vaguely doubting the forthcoming disasters in the city of borligo a wholesale execution of the new prophets took place after months of unfulfilled expectations they thought the flight to the northland unnecessary and looked no longer for the threatened endinghow they perished must have been terrible indeedthose vain foolish creatures who thought to defy the universe but the blackened scorched towns are mute these events however must not be chronicledfor there are larger things to consider than this complex and unhastening downfall of a lost civilization during a long period morale was at lowest ebb among the courageous few who settled upon the alien arctic and antarctic shores now mild as were those of southern yarat in the longdead past but here there was respite the soil was fertile and forgotten pastoral arts were called into use anew there was for a long time a contented little epitome of the lost lands though here were no vast throngs or great buildings only a sparse remnant of humanity survived the aeons of change and peopled those scattered villages of the later worldhow many millennia this continued is not known the sun was slow in invading this last retreat and as the eras passed there developed a sound sturdy race bearing no memories or legends of the old lost lands little navigation was practiced by this new people and the flying machine was wholly forgotten their devices were of the simplest type and their culture was simple and primitive yet they were contented and accepted the warm climate as something natural and accustomedbut unknown to these simple peasantfolk still further rigours of nature were slowly preparing themselves as the generations passed the waters of the vast and unplumbed ocean wasted slowly away enriching the air and the desiccated soil but sinking lower and lower each century the splashing surf still glistened bright and the swirling eddies were still there but a doom of dryness hung over the whole watery expanse however the shrinkage could not have been detected save by instruments more delicate than any then known to the race even had the people realized the oceans contraction it is not likely that any vast alarm or great disturbance would have resulted for the losses were so slight and the seas so great only a few inches during many centuriesbut in many centuries increasingso at last the oceans went and water became a rarity on a globe of sunbaked drought man had slowly spread over all the arctic and antarctic lands the equatorial cities and many of later habitation were forgotten even to legendand now again the peace was disturbed for water was scarce and found only in deep caverns there was little enough even of this and men died of thirst wandering in far places yet so slow were these deadly changes that each new generation of man was loath to believe what it heard from its parents none would admit that the heat had been less or the water more plentiful in the old days or take warning that days of bitterer burning and drought were to come thus it was even at the end when only a few hundred human creatures panted for breath beneath the cruel sun a piteous huddled handful out of all the unnumbered millions who had once dwelt on the doomed planetand the hundreds became small till man was to be reckoned only in tens these tens clung to the shrinking dampness of the caves and knew at last that the end was near so slight was their range that none had ever seen the tiny fabled spots of ice left close to the planets polesif such indeed remained even had they existed and been known to man none could have reached them across the trackless and formidable deserts and so the last pathetic few dwindled it cannot be described this awesome chain of events that depopulated the whole earth the range is too tremendous for any to picture or encompass of the people of earths fortunate ages billions of years before only a few prophets and madmen could have conceived that which was to comecould have grasped visions of the still dead lands and longempty seabeds the rest would have doubted doubted alike the shadow of change upon the planet and the shadow of doom upon the race for man has always thought himself the immortal master of natural things iiwhen he had eased the dying pangs of the old woman ull wandered in a fearful daze out into the dazzling sands she had been a fearsome thing shrivelled and so dry like withered leaves her face had been the colour of the sickly yellow grasses that rustled in the hot wind and she was loathsomely oldbut she had been a companion someone to stammer out vague fears to to talk to about this incredible thing a comrade to share ones hopes for succour from those silent other colonies beyond the mountains he could not believe none lived elsewhere for ull was young and not certain as are the oldfor many years he had known none but the old womanher name was mladdna she had come that day in his eleventh year when all the hunters went to seek food and did not return ull had no mother that he could remember and there were few women in the tiny group when the men vanished those three women the young one and the two old had screamed fearfully and moaned long then the young one had gone mad and killed herself with a sharp stick the old ones buried her in a shallow hole dug with their nails so ull had been alone when this still older mladdna cameshe walked with the aid of a knotty pole a priceless relique of the old forests hard and shiny with years of use she did not say whence she came but stumbled into the cabin while the young suicide was being buried there she waited till the two returned and they accepted her incuriouslythat was the way it had been for many weeks until the two fell sick and mladdna could not cure them strange that those younger two should have been stricken while she infirm and ancient lived on mladdna had cared for them many days and at length they died so that ull was left with only the stranger he screamed all the night so she became at length out of patience and threatened to die too then hearkening he became quiet at once for he was not desirous of complete solitude after that he lived with mladdna and they gathered roots to eatmladdnas rotten teeth were ill suited to the food they gathered but they contrived to chop it up till she could manage it this weary routine of seeking and eating was ulls childhoodnow he was strong and firm in his nineteenth year and the old woman was dead there was naught to stay for so he determined at once to seek out those fabled huts beyond the mountains and live with the people there there was nothing to take on the journey ull closed the door of his cabinwhy he could not have told for no animals had been there for many yearsand left the dead woman within halfdazed and fearful at his own audacity he walked long hours in the dry grasses and at length reached the first of the foothills the afternoon came and he climbed until he was weary and lay down on the grasses sprawled there he thought of many things he wondered at the strange life passionately anxious to seek out the lost colony beyond the mountains but at last he sleptwhen he awoke there was starlight on his face and he felt refreshed now that the sun was gone for a time he travelled more quickly eating little and determining to hasten before the lack of water became difficult to bear he had brought none for the last people dwelling in one place and never having occasion to bear their precious water away made no vessels of any kind ull hoped to reach his goal within a day and thus escape thirst so he hurried on beneath the bright stars running at times in the warm air and at other times lapsing into a dogtrotso he continued until the sun arose yet still he was within the small hills with three great peaks looming ahead in their shade he rested again then he climbed all the morning and at midday surmounted the first peak where he lay for a time surveying the space before the next rangeupon an eroded clifftop rested the man gazing far across the valley lying thus he could see a great distance but in all the sere expanse there was no visible motion the second night came and found ull amid the rough peaks the valley and the place where he had rested far behind he was nearly out of the second range now and hurrying still thirst had come upon him that day and he regretted his folly yet he could not have stayed there with the corpse alone in the grasslands he sought to convince himself thus and hastened ever on tiredly strainingand now there were only a few steps before the cliff wall would part and allow a view of the land beyond ull stumbled wearily down the stony way tumbling and bruising himself even more it was nearly before him this land where men were rumoured to have dwelt this land of which he had heard tales in his youth the way was long but the goal was great a boulder of giant circumference cut off his view upon this he scrambled anxiously now at last he could behold by the sinking orb his longsought destination and his thirst and aching muscles were forgotten as he saw joyfully that a small huddle of buildings clung to the base of the farther cliffull rested not but spurred on by what he saw ran and staggered and crawled the half mile remaining he fancied that he could detect forms among the rude cabins the sun was nearly gone the hateful devastating sun that had slain humanity he could not be sure of details but soon the cabins were nearthey were very old for clay blocks lasted long in the still dryness of the dying world little indeed changed but the living thingsthe grasses and these last menbefore him an open door swung upon rude pegs in the fading light ull entered weary unto death seeking painfully the expected facesthen he fell upon the floor and wept for at the table was propped a dry and ancient skeletonhe rose at last crazed by thirst aching unbearably and suffering the greatest disappointment any mortal could know he was then the last living thing upon the globe his the heritage of the earth all the lands and all to him equally useless he staggered up not looking at the dim white form in the reflected moonlight and went through the door about the empty village he wandered searching for water and sadly inspecting this longempty place so spectrally preserved by the changeless air here there was a dwelling there a rude place where things had been madeclay vessels holding only dust and nowhere any liquid to quench his burning thirstthen in the centre of the little town ull saw a wellcurb he knew what it was for he had heard tales of such things from mladdna with pitiful joy he reeled forward and leaned upon the edge there at last was the end of his search waterslimy stagnant and shallow but waterbefore his sightull cried out in the voice of a tortured animal groping for the chain and bucket his hand slipped on the slimy edge and he fell upon his chest across the brink for a moment he lay therethen soundlessly his body was precipitated down the black shaftthere was a slight splash in the murky shallowness as he struck some longsunken stone dislodged aeons ago from the massive coping the disturbed water subsided into quietnessand now at last the earth was dead the final pitiful survivor had perished all the teeming billions the slow aeons the empires and civilizations of mankind were summed up in this poor twisted formand how titanically meaningless it all had been now indeed had come an end and climax to all the efforts of humanityhow monstrous and incredible a climax in the eyes of those poor complacent fools of the prosperous days not ever again would the planet know the thunderous tramping of human millionsor even the crawling of lizards and the buzz of insects for they too had gone now was come the reign of sapless branches and endless fields of tough grasses earth like its cold imperturbable moon was given over to silence and blackness foreverthe stars whirred on the whole careless plan would continue for infinities unknown this trivial end of a negligible episode mattered not to distant nebulae or to suns newborn flourishing and dying the race of man too puny and momentary to have a real function or purpose was as if it had never existed to such a conclusion the aeons of its farcically toilsome evolution had ledbut when the deadly suns first rays darted across the valley a light found its way to the weary face of a broken figure that lay in the slime,1
sedibus ut saltem placidis in morte quiescamvirgilin relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented i am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative it is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few which lie outside its common experience men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of supersight which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricismmy name is jervas dudley and from earliest childhood i have been a dreamer and a visionary wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial life and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social recreations of my acquaintances i have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and littleknown books and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home i do not think that what i read in these books or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and saw there but of this i must say little since detailed speech would but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which i sometimes overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me it is sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causesi have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world but i have not said that i dwelt alone this no human creature may do for lacking the fellowship of the living he inevitably draws upon the companionship of things that are not or are no longer living close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow in whose twilight deeps i spent most of my time reading thinking and dreaming down its mosscovered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven well did i come to know the presiding dryads of those trees and often have i watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moonbut of these things i must not now speak i will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets the deserted tomb of the hydes an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birththe vault to which i refer is of ancient granite weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations excavated back into the hillside the structure is visible only at the entrance the door a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone hangs upon rusted iron hinges and is fastenedajarin a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago the abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices alluding to what they call divine wrath in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which i felt for the forestdarkened sepulchre one man only had perished in the fire when the last of the hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant land to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down no one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the waterworn stonesi shall never forget the afternoon when first i stumbled upon the halfhidden house of death it was in midsummer when the alchemy of nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green when the senses are wellnigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation in such surroundings the mind loses its perspective time and space become trivial and unreal and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness all day i had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow thinking thoughts i need not discuss and conversing with things i need not name in years a child of ten i had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng and was oddly aged in certain respects when upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers i suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault i had no knowledge of what i had discovered the dark blocks of granite the door so curiously ajar and the funereal carvings above the arch aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character of graves and tombs i knew and imagined much but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries the strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation and its cold damp interior into which i vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left contained for me no hint of death or decay but in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement spurred on by a voice which must have come from the hideous soul of the forest i resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage in the waning light of day i alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided but neither plan met with success at first curious i was now frantic and when in the thickening twilight i returned to my home i had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove thatat any costi would some day force an entrance to the black chilly depths that seemed calling out to me the physician with the irongrey beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania but i will leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt allthe months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure with the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy i learned much though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve it is perhaps worth mentioning that i was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault my rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion and i felt that the great and sinister family of the burneddown mansion was in some way represented within the stone space i sought to explore mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb before whose door i would sit for hours at a time each day once i thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward the odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me i felt i had known it before in a past remote beyond all recollection beyond even my tenancy of the body i now possessthe year after i first beheld the tomb i stumbled upon a wormeaten translation of plutarchslivesin the bookfilled attic of my home reading the life of theseus i was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight this legend had the effect of dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the vault for it made me feel that the time was not yet ripe later i told myself i should grow to a strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily chained door with ease but until then i would do better by conforming to what seemed the will of fateaccordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits i would sometimes rise very quietly in the night stealing out to walk in those churchyards and places of burial from which i had been kept by my parents what i did there i may not say for i am not now sure of the reality of certain things but i know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble i would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations it was after a night like this that i shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of the rich and celebrated squire brewster a maker of local history who was interred in 1711 and whose slate headstone bearing a graven skull and crossbones was slowly crumbling to powder in a moment of childish imagination i vowed not only that the undertaker goodman simpson had stolen the silverbuckled shoes silken hose and satin smallclothes of the deceased before burial but that the squire himself not fully inanimate had turned twice in his moundcovered coffin on the day after intermentbut the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts being indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discovery that my own maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the hydes last of my paternal race i was likewise the last of this older and more mysterious line i began to feel that the tomb wasmineand to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when i might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark i now formed the habit oflisteningvery intently at the slightly open portal choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil by the time i came of age i had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mouldstained facade of the hillside allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan bower this bower was my temple the fastened door my shrine and here i would lie outstretched on the mossy ground thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreamsthe night of the first revelation was a sultry one i must have fallen asleep from fatigue for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that i heard thevoicesof those tones and accents i hesitate to speak of theirqualityi will not speak but i may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary pronunciation and mode of utterance every shade of new england dialect from the uncouth syllables of the puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy though it was only later that i noticed the fact at the time indeed my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon its reality i barely fancied that as i awoke alighthad been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre i do not think i was either astounded or panicstricken but i know that i was greatly and permanentlychangedthat night upon returning home i went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic wherein i found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier i had so long stormed in vainit was in the soft glow of late afternoon that i first entered the vault on the abandoned slope a spell was upon me and my heart leaped with an exultation i can but ill describe as i closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle i seemed to know the way and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place i felt singularly at home in the musty charnelhouse air looking about me i beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins or the remains of coffins some of these were sealed and intact but others had nearly vanished leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust upon one plate i read the name of sir geoffrey hyde who had come from sussex in 1640 and died here a few years later in a conspicuous alcove was one fairly wellpreserved and untenanted casket adorned with a single name which brought to me both a smile and a shudder an odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab extinguish my candle and lie down within the vacant boxin the grey light of dawn i staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the door behind me i was no longer a young man though but twentyone winters had chilled my bodily frame earlyrising villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary i did not appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleephenceforward i haunted the tomb each night seeing hearing and doing things i must never reveal my speech always susceptible to environmental influences was the first thing to succumb to the change and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour till i unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion my formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a rochester i displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic monkish lore over which i had pored in youth and covered the flyleaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of gay prior and the sprightliest of the augustan wits and rimesters one morning at breakfast i came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquorish accents an effusion of eighteenthcentury bacchanalian mirth a bit of georgian playfulness never recorded in a book which ran something like thiscome hither my lads with your tankards of aleand drink to the present before it shall failpile each on your platter a mountain of beeffor tis eating and drinking that bring us reliefso fill up your glassfor life will soon passwhen

scarce able to walkand damn me if i can stand upright or talkhere landlord bid betty to summon a chairill try home for a while for my wife is not thereso lend me a handim not able to standbut im gay whilst i linger on top of the landabout this time i conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms previously indifferent to such things i had now an unspeakable horror of them and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display a favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down and in fancy i would picture the structure as it had been in its prime on one occasion i startled a villager by leading him confidently to a shallow subcellar of whose existence i seemed to know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen and forgotten for many generationsat last came that which i had long feared my parents alarmed at the altered manner and appearance of their only son commenced to exert over my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in disaster i had told no one of my visits to the tomb having guarded my secret purpose with religious zeal since childhood but now i was forced to exercise care in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow that i might throw off a possible pursuer my key to the vault i kept suspended from a cord about my neck its presence known only to me i never carried out of the sepulchre any of the things i came upon whilst within its wallsone morning as i emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the chain of the portal with none too steady hand i beheld in an adjacent thicket the dreaded face of a watcher surely the end was near for my bower was discovered and the objective of my nocturnal journeys revealed the man did not accost me so i hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father were my sojourns beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in a cautious whisperthat i had spent the night in the bower outside the tombmy sleepfilmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar by what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded i was now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me made bold by this heavensent circumstance i began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault confident that no one could witness my entrance for a week i tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality which i must not describe when thethinghappened and i was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotonyi should not have ventured out that night for the taint of thunder was in the clouds and a hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow the call of the dead too was different instead of the hillside tomb it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers as i emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin i beheld in the misty moonlight a thing i had always vaguely expected the mansion gone for a century once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles up the long drive rolled the coaches of the boston gentry whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions with this throng i mingled though i knew i belonged with the hosts rather than with the guests inside the hall were music laughter and wine on every hand several faces i recognised though i should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition amidst a wild and reckless throng i was the wildest and most abandoned gay blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips and in my shocking sallies i heeded no law of god man or nature suddenly a peal of thunder resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house and the roysterers struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided nature fled shrieking into the night i alone remained riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which i had never felt before and then a second horror took possession of my soul burnt alive to ashes my body dispersed by the four windsi might never lie in the tomb of the hydeswas not my coffin prepared for me had i not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey hyde aye i would claim my heritage of death even though my soul go seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to represent it on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vaultjervas hydeshould never share the sad fate of palinurusas the phantom of the burning house faded i found myself screaming and struggling madly in the arms of two men one of whom was the spy who had followed me to the tomb rain was pouring down in torrents and upon the southern horizon were flashes of the lightning that had so lately passed over our heads my father his face lined with sorrow stood by as i shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could a blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens and from this spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship which the thunderbolt had brought to light ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing i watched the spectators as they viewed the treasuretrove and was permitted to share in their discoveries the box whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it contained many papers and objects of value but i had eyes for one thing alone it was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly curled bagwig and bore the initials j h the face was such that as i gazed i might well have been studying my mirroron the following day i was brought to this room with the barred windows but i have been kept informed of certain things through an aged and simpleminded servitor for whom i bore a fondness in infancy and who like me loves the churchyard what i have dared relate of my experiences within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles my father who visits me frequently declares that at no time did i pass the chained portal and swears that the rusted padlock had not been touched for fifty years when he examined it he even says that all the village knew of my journeys to the tomb and that i was often watched as i slept in the bower outside the grim facade my halfopen eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior against these assertions i have no tangible proof to offer since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors the strange things of the past which i learnt during those nocturnal meetings with the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and omnivorous browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library had it not been for my old servant hiram i should have by this time become quite convinced of my madnessbut hiram loyal to the last has held faith in me and has done that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story a week ago he burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb perpetually ajar and descended with a lantern into the murky depths on a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished plate bears the single wordjervasin that coffin and in that vault they have promised me i shall be buried,1
of the events which took place at the norton mine on october 18th and 19th 1894 i have no desire to speak a sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall in these last years of my life scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because i cannot wholly define it but i believe that before i die i should tell what i know of theshall i say transitionof juan romeromy name and origin need not be related to posterity in fact i fancy it is better that they should not be for when a man suddenly migrates to the states or the colonies he leaves his past behind him besides what i once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative save perhaps the fact that during my service in india i was more at home amongst whitebearded native teachers than amongst my brotherofficers i had delved not a little into odd eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in americas vast westa life wherein i found it well to accept a namemy present onewhich is very common and carries no meaningin the summer and autumn of 1894 i dwelt in the drear expanses of the cactus mountains employed as a common labourer at the celebrated norton mine whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life a cavern of gold lying deep below a mountain lake had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams and now formed the seat of extensive tunnelling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold additional grottoes had been found and the yield of yellow metal was exceedingly great so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows the superintendent a mr arthur often discussed the singularity of the local geological formations speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves and estimating the future of the titanic mining enterprise he considered the auriferous cavities the result of the action of water and believed the last of them would soon be openedit was not long after my arrival and employment that juan romero came to the norton mine one of a large herd of unkempt mexicans attracted thither from the neighbouring country he at first commanded attention only because of his features which though plainly of the red indian type were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation being vastly unlike those of the average greaser or piute of the locality it is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians romero gave not the least impression of caucasian blood it was not the castilian conquistador or the american pioneer but the ancient and noble aztec whom imagination called to view when the silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it crept above the eastern hills meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in the performance of some rite whose nature he did not himself comprehend but save for his face romero was not in any way suggestive of nobility ignorant and dirty he was at home amongst the other brownskinned mexicans having come so i was afterward told from the very lowest sort of surroundings he had been found as a child in a crude mountain hut the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked lethally by near the hut close to a rather unusual rock fissure had lain two skeletons newly picked by vultures and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents no one recalled their identity and they were soon forgotten by the many indeed the crumbling of the adobe hut and the closing of the rock fissure by a subsequent avalanche had helped to efface even the scene from recollection reared by a mexican cattlethief who had given him his name juan differed little from his fellowsthe attachment which romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commenced through the quaint and ancient hindoo ring which i wore when not engaged in active labour of its nature and manner of coming into my possession i cannot speak it was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed and i valued it highly soon i observed that the oddlooking mexican was likewise interested eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but active mind though he could not possibly have beheld their like before within a few weeks after his advent romero was like a faithful servant to me this notwithstanding the fact that i was myself but an ordinary miner our conversation was necessarily limited he knew but a few words of english while i found my oxonian spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of new spainthe event which i am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions though the man romero had interested me and though my ring had affected him peculiarly i think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area and the belief of the superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite with this work romero and i were not connected wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others the charge heavier perhaps than had been estimated had seemed to shake the entire mountain windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet jewel lake which lay above the scene of action heaved as in a tempest upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it nor any lamp illuminate it baffled the excavators sought a conference with the superintendent who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discoveredshortly afterward the palefaced workmen apprised the superintendent of their failure firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them for so far as they could ascertain the void below was infinite the superintendent did not reproach them instead he pondered deeply and made many plans for the following day the night shift did not go on that eveningat two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally from somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer either to the coyoteor to something else a storm was gathering around the peaks of the range and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moons attempts to shine through many layers of cirrostratus vapours it was romeros voice coming from the bunk above that awakened me a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation i could not understandmadre de diosel sonidoese sonidooiga vd lo oye vdseorthat soundi listened wondering what sound he meant the coyote the dog the storm all were audible the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind shrieked more and more frantically flashes of lightning were visible through the bunkhouse window i questioned the nervous mexican repeating the sounds i had heardel coyoteel perroel vientobut romero did not reply then he commenced whispering as in aweel ritmo seorel ritmo de la tierrathat throb down in the groundand now i also heard heard and shivered and without knowing why deep deep below me was a sounda rhythm just as the peon had saidwhich though exceedingly faint yet dominated even the dog the coyote and the increasing tempest to seek to describe it were uselessfor it was such that no description is possible perhaps it was like the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner as sensed from the deck yet it was not so mechanical not so devoid of the element of life and consciousness of all its qualitiesremotenessin the earth most impressed me to my mind rushed fragments of a passage in joseph glanvill which poe has quoted with tremendous effectthe vastness profundity and unsearchableness of his workswhich have a depth in them greater than the well of democritussuddenly romero leaped from his bunk pausing before me to gaze at the strange ring on my hand which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning and then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft i also rose and both stood motionless for a time straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door whose rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality the chanting in the depthsfor such the sound now seemed to begrew in volume and distinctness and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaftwe encountered no living creature for the men of the night shift had been released from duty and were doubtless at the dry gulch settlement pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender from the watchmans cabin however gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye i dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman but romero was moving more swiftly now and i followed without pausingas we descended the shaft the sound beneath grew definitely composite it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony with beating of drums and chanting of many voices i have as you are aware been much in india romero and i moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders ever toward the thing that allured us yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance at one time i fancied i had gone madthis was when on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle i realised that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp heavy air aroundit was without warning that romero after clambering down one of the many rude ladders broke into a run and left me alone some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting perceptible but slightly to me had acted on him in startling fashion and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the caverns gloom i heard his repeated shrieks before me as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders and frightened as i was i yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech when articulate was not of any sort known to me harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad spanish and worse english and of these only the oft repeated cryhuitzilopotchliseemed in the least familiar later i definitely placed that word in the works of a great historianand shuddered when the association came to methe climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief beginning just as i reached the final cavern of the journey out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the mexican which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as i could never hear again and survive in that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished and i saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me i had arrived at the abyss which was now redly aglow and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate romero advancing i peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar at first i beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity but then shapes all infinitely distant began to detach themselves from the confusion and i sawwas it juan romerobut god i dare not tell you what i saw some power from heaven coming to my aid obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space chaos supervened and i knew the peace of oblivioni hardly know how to continue since conditions so singular are involved but i will do my best not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent when i awaked i was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window some distance away the lifeless body of juan romero lay upon a table surrounded by a group of men including the camp doctor the men were discussing the strange death of the mexican as he lay asleep a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain no direct cause was evident and an autopsy failed to shew any reason why romero should not be living snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither romero nor i had left the bunkhouse during the night that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the cactus range that storm said men who had ventured down the mine shaft had caused extensive caving in and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before when i asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt he mentioned a coyote a dog and the snarling mountain windnothing more nor do i doubt his wordupon the resumption of work superintendent arthur called on some especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where the gulf had appeared though hardly eager they obeyed and a deep boring was made results were very curious the roof of the void as seen whilst it was open was not by any means thick yet now the drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock finding nothing else not even gold the superintendent abandoned his attempts but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his deskone other thing is curious shortly after waking on that morning after the storm i noticed the unaccountable absence of my hindoo ring from my finger i had prized it greatly yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance if one of my fellowminers appropriated it he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty for despite advertisements and a police search the ring was never seen again somehow i doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands for many strange things were taught me in indiamy opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time in broad daylight and at most seasons i am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream but sometimes in the autumn about two in the morning when winds and animals howl dismally there comes from inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing and i feel that the transition of juan romero was a terrible one indeed,1
it was on a certain thursday morning in december that the whole thing began with that unaccountable motion i thought i saw in my antique copenhagen mirror something it seemed to me stirredsomething reflected in the glass though i was alone in my quarters i paused and looked intently then deciding that the effect must be a pure illusion resumed the interrupted brushing of my hairi had discovered the old mirror covered with dust and cobwebs in an outbuilding of an abandoned estatehouse in santa cruzs sparsely settled northside territory and had brought it to the united states from the virgin islands the venerable glass was dim from more than two hundred years exposure to a tropical climate and the graceful ornamentation along the top of the gilt frame had been badly smashed i had had the detached pieces set back into the frame before placing it in storage with my other belongingsnow several years later i was staying half as a guest and half as a tutor at the private school of my old friend browne on a windy connecticut hillsideoccupying an unused wing in one of the dormitories where i had two rooms and a hallway to myself the old mirror stowed securely in mattresses was the first of my possessions to be unpacked on my arrival and i had set it up majestically in the livingroom on top of an old rosewood console which had belonged to my greatgrandmotherthe door of my bedroom was just opposite that of the livingroom with a hallway between and i had noticed that by looking into my chiffonier glass i could see the larger mirror through the two doorwayswhich was exactly like glancing down an endless though diminishing corridor on this thursday morning i thought i saw a curious suggestion of motion down that normally empty corridorbut as i have said soon dismissed the notionwhen i reached the diningroom i found everyone complaining of the cold and learned that the schools heatingplant was temporarily out of order being especially sensitive to low temperatures i was myself an acute sufferer and at once decided not to brave any freezing schoolroom that day accordingly i invited my class to come over to my livingroom for an informal session around my gratefirea suggestion which the boys received enthusiasticallyafter the session one of the boys robert grandison asked if he might remain since he had no appointment for the second morning period i told him to stay and welcome he sat down to study in front of the fireplace in a comfortable chairit was not long however before robert moved to another chair somewhat farther away from the freshly replenished blaze this change bringing him directly opposite the old mirror from my own chair in another part of the room i noticed how fixedly he began to look at the dim cloudy glass and wondering what so greatly interested him was reminded of my own experience earlier that morning as time passed he continued to gaze a slight frown knitting his browsat last i quietly asked him what had attracted his attention slowly and still wearing the puzzled frown he looked over and replied rather cautiouslyits the corrugations in the glassor whatever they are mr canevin i was noticing how they all seem to run from a certain point lookill show you what i meanthe boy jumped up went over to the mirror and placed his finger on a point near its lower lefthand cornerits right here sir he explained turning to look toward me and keeping his finger on the chosen spothis muscular action in turning may have pressed his finger against the glass suddenly he withdrew his hand as though with some slight effort and with a faintly muttered ouch then he looked at the glass in obvious mystificationwhat happened i asked rising and approachingwhyit he seemed embarrassed itifeltwell as though it were pulling my finger into it seemserperfectly foolish sir butwellit was a most peculiar sensation robert had an unusual vocabulary for his fifteen yearsi came over and had him show me the exact spot he meantyoull think im rather a fool sir he said shamefacedly butwell from right here i cant be absolutely sure from the chair it seemed to be clear enoughnow thoroughly interested i sat down in the chair robert had occupied and looked at the spot he selected on the mirror instantly the thing jumped out at me unmistakably from that particular angle all the many whorls in the ancient glass appeared to converge like a large number of spread strings held in one hand and radiating out in streamsgetting up and crossing to the mirror i could no longer see the curious spot only from certain angles apparently was it visible directly viewed that portion of the mirror did not even give back a normal reflectionfor i could not see my face in it manifestly i had a minor puzzle on my handspresently the school gong sounded and the fascinated robert grandison departed hurriedly leaving me alone with my odd little problem in optics i raised several windowshades crossed the hallway and sought for the spot in the chiffonier mirrors reflection finding it readily i looked very intently and thought i again detected something of the motion i craned my neck and at last at a certain angle of vision the thing again jumped out at methe vague motion was now positive and definitean appearance of torsional movement or of whirling much like a minute yet intense whirlwind or waterspout or a huddle of autumn leaves dancing circularly in an eddy of wind along a level lawn it was like the earths a double motionaround and around and at the same timeinwardas if the whorls poured themselves endlessly toward some point inside the glass fascinated yet realizing that the thing must be an illusion i grasped an impression of quite distinctsuctionand thought of roberts embarrassed explanationi felt as though it were pulling my finger into ita kind of slight chill ran suddenly up and down my backbone there was something here distinctly worth looking into and as the idea of investigation came to me i recalled the rather wistful expression of robert grandison when the gong called him to class i remembered how he had looked back over his shoulder as he walked obediently out into the hallway and resolved that he should be included in whatever analysis i might make of this little mysteryexciting events connected with that same robert however were soon to chase all thoughts of the mirror from my consciousness for a time i was away all that afternoon and did not return to the school until the fivefifteen callovera general assembly at which the boys attendance was compulsory dropping in at this function with the idea of picking robert up for a session with the mirror i was astonished and pained to find him absenta very unusual and unaccountable thing in his case that evening browne told me that the boy had actually disappeared a search in his room in the gymnasium and in all other accustomed places being unavailing though all his belongingsincluding his outdoor clothingwere in their proper placeshe had not been encountered on the ice or with any of the hiking groups that afternoon and telephone calls to all the schoolcatering merchants of the neighborhood were in vain there was in short no record of his having been seen since the end of the lesson periods at twofifteen when he had turned up the stairs toward his room in dormitory number threewhen the disappearance was fully realized the resulting sensation was tremendous throughout the school browne as headmaster had to bear the brunt of it and such an unprecedented occurrence in his wellregulated highly organized institution left him quite bewildered it was learned that robert had not run away to his home in western pennsylvania nor did any of the searchingparties of boys and masters find any trace of him in the snowy countryside around the school so far as could be seen he had simply vanishedroberts parents arrived on the afternoon of the second day after his disappearance they took their trouble quietly though of course they were staggered by this unexpected disaster browne looked ten years older for it but there was absolutely nothing that could be done by the fourth day the case had settled down in the opinion of the school as an insoluble mystery mr and mrs grandison went reluctantly back to their home and on the following morning the ten days christmas vacation beganboys and masters departed in anything but the usual holiday spirit and browne and his wife were left along with the servants as my only fellowoccupants of the big place without the masters and boys it seemed a very hollow shell indeedthat afternoon i sat in front of my gratefire thinking about roberts disappearance and evolving all sorts of fantastic theories to account for it by evening i had acquired a bad headache and ate a light supper accordingly then after a brisk walk around the massed buildings i returned to my livingroom and took up the burden of thought once morea little after ten oclock i awakened in my armchair stiff and chilled from a doze during which i had let the fire go out i was physically uncomfortable yet mentally aroused by a peculiar sensation of expectancy and possible hope of course it had to do with the problem that was harassing me for i had started from that inadvertent nap with a curious persistent ideathe odd idea that a tenuous hardly recognizable robert grandison had been trying desperately to communicate with me i finally went to bed with one conviction unreasoningly strong in my mind somehow i was sure that young robert grandison was still alivethat i should be receptive of such a notion will not seem strange to those who know my long residence in the west indies and my close contact with unexplained happenings there it will not seem strange either that i fell asleep with an urgent desire to establish some sort of mental communication with the missing boy even the most prosaic scientists affirm with freud jung and adler that the subconscious mind is most open to external impressions in sleep though such impressions are seldom carried over intact into the waking stategoing a step further and granting the existence of telepathic forces it follows that such forces must act most strongly on a sleeper so that if i were ever to get a definite message from robert it would be during a period of profoundest slumber of course i might lose the message in waking but my aptitude for retaining such things has been sharpened by types of mental discipline picked up in various obscure corners of the globei must have dropped asleep instantaneously and from the vividness of my dreams and the absence of wakeful intervals i judge that my sleep was a very deep one it was sixfortyfive when i awakened and there still lingered with me certain impressions which i knew were carried over from the world of somnolent cerebration filling my mind was the vision of robert grandison strangely transformed to a boy of a dull greenish darkblue color robert desperately endeavoring to communicate with me by means of speech yet finding some almost insuperable difficulty in so doing a wall of curious spatial separation seemed to stand between him and mea mysterious invisible wall which completely baffled us bothi had seen robert as though at some distance yet queerly enough he seemed at the same time to be just beside me he was both larger and smaller than in real life his apparent size varyingdirectlyinstead ofinverselywith the distance as he advanced and retreated in the course of conversation that is he grew larger instead of smaller to my eye when he stepped away or backwards and vice versa as if the laws of perspective in his case had been wholly reversed his aspect was misty and uncertainas if he lacked sharp or permanent outlines and the anomalies of his coloring and clothing baffled me utterly at firstat some point in my dream roberts vocal efforts had finally crystallized into audible speechalbeit speech of an abnormal thickness and dullness i could not for a time understand anything he said and even in the dream racked my brain for a clue to where he was what he wanted to tell and why his utterance was so clumsy and unintelligible then little by little i began to distinguish words and phrases the very first of which sufficed to throw my dreaming self into the wildest excitement and to establish a certain mental connection which had previously refused to take conscious form because of the utter incredibility of what it impliedi do not know how long i listened to those halting words amidst my deep slumber but hours must have passed while the strangely remote speaker struggled on with his tale there was revealed to me such a circumstance as i cannot hope to make others believe without the strongest corroborative evidence yet which i was quite ready to accept as truthboth in the dream and after wakingbecause of my former contacts with uncanny things the boy was obviously watching my facemobile in receptive sleepas he choked along for about the time i began to comprehend him his own expression brightened and gave signs of gratitude and hopeany attempt to hint at roberts message as it lingered in my ears after a sudden awakening in the cold brings this narrative to a point where i must choose my words with the greatest care everything involved is so difficult to record that one tends to flounder helplessly i have said that the revelation established in my mind a certain connection which reason had not allowed me to formulate consciously before this connection i need no longer hesitate to hint had to do with the old copenhagen mirror whose suggestions of motion had so impressed me on the morning of the disappearance and whose whorllike contours and apparent illusions of suction had later exerted such a disquieting fascination on both robert and meresolutely though my outer consciousness had previously rejected what my intuition would have liked to imply it could reject that stupendous conception no longer what was fantasy in the tale of alice now came to me as a grave and immediate reality that lookingglass had indeed possessed a malign abnormal suction and the struggling speaker in my dream made clear the extent to which it violated all the known precedents of human experience and all the ageold laws of our three sane dimensions it was more than a mirrorit was a gate a trap a link with spatial recesses not meant for the denizens of our visible universe and realizable only in terms of the most intricate noneuclidean mathematicsand in some outrageous fashion robert grandison had passed out of our ken into the glass and was there immured waiting for releaseit is significant that upon awakening i harbored no genuine doubt of the reality of the revelation that i had actually held conversation with a transdimensional robert rather than evoked the whole episode from my broodings about his disappearance and about the old illusions of the mirror was as certain to my utmost instincts as any of the instinctive certainties commonly recognized as validthe tale thus unfolded to me was of the most incredibly bizarre character as had been clear on the morning of his disappearance robert was intensely fascinated by the ancient mirror all through the hours of school he had it in mind to come back to my livingroom and examine it further when he did arrive after the close of the school day it was somewhat later than twotwenty and i was absent in town finding me out and knowing that i would not mind he had come into my livingroom and gone straight to the mirror standing before it and studying the place where as we had noted the whorls appeared to convergethen quite suddenly there had come to him an overpowering urge to place his hand upon this whorlcenter almost reluctantly against his better judgment he had done so and upon making the contact had felt at once the strange almost painful suction which had perplexed him that morning immediately thereafterquite without warning but with a wrench which seemed to twist and tear every bone and muscle in his body and to bulge and press and cut at every nervehe had been abruptlydrawn throughand found himselfinsideonce through the excruciatingly painful stress upon his entire system was suddenly released he felt he said as though he had just been borna feeling that made itself evident every time he tried to do anything walk stoop turn his head or utter speech everything about his body seemed a misfitthese sensations wore off after a long while roberts body becoming an organized whole rather than a number of protesting parts of all the forms of expression speech remained the most difficult doubtless because it is complicated bringing into play a number of different organs muscles and tendons roberts feet on the other hand were the first members to adjust themselves to the new conditions within the glassduring the morning hours i rehearsed the whole reasondefying problem correlating everything i had seen and heard dismissing the natural scepticism of a man of sense and scheming to devise possible plans for roberts release from his incredible prison as i did so a number of originally perplexing points became clearor at least clearerto methere was for example the matter of roberts coloring his face and hands as i have indicated were a kind of dull greenish darkblue and i may add that his familiar blue norfolk jacket had turned to a pale lemonyellow while his trousers remained a neutral gray as before reflecting on this after waking i found the circumstance closely allied to the reversal of perspective which made robert seem to grow larger when receding and smaller when approaching here too was a physicalreversalfor every detail of his coloring in the unknown dimension was the exact reverse or complement of the corresponding color detail in normal life in physics the typical complementary colors are blue and yellow and red and green these pairs are opposites and when mixed yield gray roberts natural color was a pinkishbuff the opposite of which is the greenishblue i saw his blue coat had become yellow while the gray trousers remained gray this latter point baffled me until i remembered that gray is itself a mixture of opposites there is no opposite for grayor rather it is its own oppositeanother clarified point was that pertaining to roberts curiously dulled and thickened speechas well as to the general awkwardness and sense of misfit bodily parts of which he complained this at the outset was a puzzle indeed though after long thought the clue occurred to me here again was the samereversalwhich affected perspective and coloration anyone in the fourth dimension must necessarily be reversed in just this wayhands and feet as well as colors and perspectives being changed about it would be the same with all the other dual organs such as nostrils ears and eyes thus robert had been talking with a reversed tongue teeth vocal cords and kindred speechapparatus so that his difficulties in utterance were little to be wondered atas the morning wore on my sense of the stark reality and maddening urgency of the dreamdisclosed situation increased rather than decreased more and more i felt that something must be done yet realized that i could not seek advice or aid such a story as minea conviction based upon mere dreamingcould not conceivably bring me anything but ridicule or suspicions as to my mental state and what indeed could i do aided or unaided with as little working data as my nocturnal impressions had provided i must i finally recognized have more information before i could even think of a possible plan for releasing robert this could come only through the receptive conditions of sleep and it heartened me to reflect that according to every probability my telepathic contact would be resumed the moment i fell into deep slumber againi accomplished sleeping that afternoon after a midday dinner at which through rigid selfcontrol i succeeded in concealing from browne and his wife the tumultuous thoughts that crashed through my mind hardly had my eyes closed when a dim telepathic image began to appear and i soon realized to my infinite excitement that it was identical with what i had seen before if anything it was more distinct and when it began to speak i seemed able to grasp a greater proportion of the wordsduring this sleep i found most of the mornings deductions confirmed though the interview was mysteriously cut off long prior to my awakening robert had seemed apprehensive just before communication ceased but had already told me that in his strange fourthdimensional prison colors and spatial relationships were indeed reversedblack being white distance increasing apparent size and so onhe had also intimated that notwithstanding his possession of full physical form and sensations most human vital properties seemed curiously suspended nutriment for example was quite unnecessarya phenomenon really more singular than the omnipresent reversal of objects and attributes since the latter was a reasonable and mathematically indicated state of things another significant piece of information was that the only exit from the glass to the world was the entranceway and that this was permanently barred and impenetrably sealed so far as egress was concernedthat night i had another visitation from robert nor did such impressions received at odd intervals while i slept receptively minded cease during the entire period of his incarceration his efforts to communicate were desperate and often pitiful for at times the telepathic bond would weaken while at other times fatigue excitement or fear of interruption would hamper and thicken his speechi may as well narrate as a continuous whole all that robert told me throughout the whole series of transient mental contactsperhaps supplementing it at certain points with facts directly related after his release the telepathic information was fragmentary and often nearly inarticulate but i studied it over and over during the waking intervals of three intense days classifying and cogitating with feverish diligence since it was all that i had to go upon if the boy were to be brought back into our worldthe fourthdimensional region in which robert found himself was not as in scientific romance an unknown and infinite realm of strange sights and fantastic denizens but was rather a projection of certain limited parts of our own terrestrial sphere within an alien and normally inaccessible aspect or direction of space it was a curiously fragmentary intangible and heterogeneous worlda series of apparently dissociated scenes merging indistinctly one into the other their constituent details having an obviously different status from that of an object drawn into the ancient mirror as robert had been drawn these scenes were like dreamvistas or magiclantern imageselusive visual impressions of which the boy was not really a part but which formed a sort of panoramic background or ethereal environment against which or amidst which he movedhe could not touch any of the parts of these sceneswalls trees furniture and the likebut whether this was because they were truly nonmaterial or because they always receded at his approach he was singularly unable to determine everything seemed fluid mutable and unreal when he walked it appeared to be on whatever lower surface the visible scene might havefloor path greensward or such but upon analysis he always found that the contact was an illusion there was never any difference in the resisting force met by his feetand by his hands when he would stoop experimentallyno matter what changes of apparent surface might be involved he could not describe this foundation or limiting plane on which he walked as anything more definite than a virtually abstract pressure balancing his gravity of definite tactile distinctiveness it had none and supplementing it there seemed to be a kind of restricted levitational force which accomplished transfers of altitude he could never actually climb stairs yet would gradually walk up from a lower level to a higherpassage from one definite scene to another involved a sort of gliding through a region of shadow or blurred focus where the details of each scene mingled curiously all the vistas were distinguished by the absence of transient objects and the indefinite or ambiguous appearance of such semitransient objects as furniture or details of vegetation the lighting of every scene was diffuse and perplexing and of course the scheme of reversed colorsbright red grass yellow sky with confused black and gray cloudforms white treetrunks and green brick wallsgave to everything an air of unbelievable grotesquerie there was an alteration of day and night which turned out to be a reversal of the normal hours of light and darkness at whatever point on the earth the mirror might be hangingthis seemingly irrelevant diversity of the scenes puzzled robert until he realized that they comprised merely such places as had been reflected for long continuous periods in the ancient glass this also explained the odd absence of transient objects the generally arbitrary boundaries of vision and the fact that all exteriors were framed by the outlines of doorways or windows the glass it appeared had power to store up these intangible scenes through long exposure though it could never absorb anything corporeally as robert had been absorbed except by a very different and particular processbutto me at leastthe most incredible aspect of the mad phenomenon was the monstrous subversion of our known laws of space involved in the relation of various illusory scenes to the actual terrestrial regions represented i have spoken of the glass as storing up the images of these regions but this is really an inexact definition in truth each of the mirror scenes formed a true and quasipermanent fourthdimensional projection of the corresponding mundane region so that whenever robert moved to a certain part of a certain scene as he moved into the image of my room when sending his telepathic messageshe was actually in that place itself on earththough under spatial conditions which cut off all sensory communication in either direction between him and the present tridimensional aspect of the placetheoretically speaking a prisoner in the glass could in a few moments go anywhere on our planetinto any place that is which had ever been reflected in the mirrors surface this probably applied even to places where the mirror had not hung long enough to produce a clear illusory scene the terrestrial region being then represented by a zone of more or less formless shadow outside the definite scenes was a seemingly limitless waste of neutral gray shadow about which robert could never be certain and into which he never dared stray far lest he become hopelessly lost to the real and mirror worlds alikeamong the earliest particulars which robert gave was the fact that he was not alone in his confinement various others all in antique garb were in there with hima corpulent middleaged gentleman with tied queue and velvet kneebreeches who spoke english fluently though with a marked scandinavian accent a rather beautiful small girl with very blonde hair which appeared a glossy dark blue two apparently mute negroes whose features contrasted grotesquely with the pallor of their reversedcolored skins three young men one young woman a very small child almost an infant and a lean elderly dane of extremely distinctive aspect and a kind of halfmalign intellectuality of countenancethis lastnamed individualaxel holm who wore the satin smallclothes flaredskirted coat and voluminous fullbottomed periwig of an age more than two centuries in the pastwas notable among the little band as being the one responsible for the presence of them all he it was who skilled equally in the arts of magic and glass working had long ago fashioned this strange dimensional prison in which himself his slaves and those whom he chose to invite or allure thither were immured unchangingly for as long as the mirror might endureholm was born early in the seventeenth century and had followed with tremendous competence and success the trade of a glassblower and molder in copenhagen his glass especially in the form of large drawingroom mirrors was always at a premium but the same bold mind which had made him the first glazier of europe also served to carry his interests and ambitions far beyond the sphere of mere material craftsmanship he had studied the world around him and chafed at the limitations of human knowledge and capability eventually he sought for dark ways to overcome those limitations and gained more success than is good for any mortalhe had aspired to enjoy something like eternity the mirror being his provision to secure this end serious study of the fourth dimension was far from beginning with einstein in our own era and holm more than erudite in all the methods of his day knew that a bodily entrance into that hidden phase of space would prevent him from dying in the ordinary physical sense research showed him that the principle of reflection undoubtedly forms the chief gate to all dimensions beyond our familiar three and chance placed in his hands a small and very ancient glass whose cryptic properties he believed he could turn to advantage once inside this mirror according to the method he had envisaged he felt that life in the sense of form and consciousness would go on virtually forever provided the mirror could be preserved indefinitely from breakage or deteriorationholm made a magnificent mirror such as would be prized and carefully preserved and in it deftly fused the strange whorlconfigured relic he had acquired having thus prepared his refuge and his trap he began to plan his mode of entrance and conditions of tenancy he would have with him both servitors and companions and as an experimental beginning he sent before him into the glass two dependable negro slaves brought from the west indies what his sensations must have been upon beholding this first concrete demonstration of his theories only imagination can conceiveundoubtedly a man of his knowledge realized that absence from the outside world if deferred beyond the natural span of life of those within must mean instant dissolution at the first attempt to return to that world but barring that misfortune or accidental breakage those within would remain forever as they were at the time of entrance they would never grow old and would need neither food nor drinkto make his prison tolerable he sent ahead of him certain books and writing materials a chair and table of stoutest workmanship and a few other accessories he knew that the images which the glass would reflect or absorb would not be tangible but would merely extend around him like a background of dream his own transition in 1687 was a momentous experience and must have been attended by mixed sensations of triumph and terror had anything gone wrong there were frightful possibilities of being lost in dark and inconceivable multiple dimensionsfor over fifty years he had been unable to secure any additions to the little company of himself and slaves but later on he had perfected his telepathic method of visualizing small sections of the outside world close to the glass and attracting certain individuals in those areas through the mirrors strange entrance thus robert influenced into a desire to press upon the door had been lured within such visualizations depended wholly on telepathy since no one inside the mirror could see out into the world of menit was in truth a strange life that holm and his company had lived inside the glass since the mirror had stood for fully a century with its face to the dusty stone wall of the shed where i found it robert was the first being to enter this limbo after all that interval his arrival was a gala event for he brought news of the outside world which must have been of the most startling impressiveness to the more thoughtful of those within he in his turnyoung though he wasfelt overwhelmingly the weirdness of meeting and talking with persons who had been alive in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesthe deadly monotony of life for the prisoners can only be vaguely conjectured as mentioned its extensive spatial variety was limited to localities which had been reflected in the mirror for long periods and many of these had become dim and strange as tropical climates had made inroads on the surface certain localities were bright and beautiful and in these the company usually gathered but no scene could be fully satisfying since the visible objects were all unreal and intangible and often of perplexingly indefinite outline when the tedious periods of darkness came the general custom was to indulge in memories reflections or conversations each one of that strange pathetic group had retained his or her personality unchanged and unchangeable since becoming immune to the time effects of outside spacethe number of inanimate objects within the glass aside from the clothing of the prisoners was very small being largely limited to the accessories holm had provided for himself the rest did without even furniture since sleep and fatigue had vanished along with most other vital attributes such inorganic things as were present seemed as exempt from decay as the living beings the lower forms of animal life were wholly absentrobert derived most of his information from herr thiele the gentleman who spoke english with a scandinavian accent this portly dane had taken a fancy to him and talked at considerable length the others too had received him with courtesy and goodwill holm himself seeming welldisposed had told him about various matters including the door of the trapthe boy as he told me later was sensible enough never to attempt communication with me when holm was nearby twice while thus engaged he had seen holm appear and had accordingly ceased at once at no time could i see the world behind the mirrors surface roberts visual image which included his bodily form and the clothing connected with it waslike the aural image of his halting voice and like his own visualization of myselfa case of purely telepathic transmission and did not involve true interdimensional sight however had robert been as trained a telepathist as holm he might have transmitted a few strong images apart from his immediate personthroughout this period of revelation i had of course been desperately trying to devise a method for roberts release on the fourth daythe ninth after the disappearancei hit on a solution everything considered my laboriously formulated process was not a very complicated one though i could not tell beforehand how it would work while the possibility of ruinous consequences in case of a slip was appalling this process depended basically on the fact that there was no possible exit from inside the glass if holm and his prisoners were permanently sealed in then release must come wholly from outside other considerations included the disposal of the other prisoners if any survived and especially of axel holm what robert had told me of him was anything but reassuring and i certainly did not wish him loose in my apartment free once more to work his evil will upon the world the telepathic messages had not made fully clear the effect of liberation on those who had entered the glass so long agothere was too a final though minor problem in case of successthat of getting robert back into the routine of school life without having to explain the incredible in case of failure it was highly inadvisable to have witnesses present at the release operationsand lacking these i simply could not attempt to relate the actual facts if i should succeed even to me the reality seemed a mad one whenever i let my mind turn from the data so compellingly presented in that tense series of dreamswhen i had thought these problems through as far as possible i procured a large magnifyingglass from the school laboratory and studied minutely every square millimeter of that whorlcenter which presumably marked the extent of the original ancient mirror used by holm even with this aid i could not quite trace the exact boundary between the old area and the surface added by the danish wizard but after a long study decided on a conjectural oval boundary which i outlined very precisely with a soft blue pencil i then made a trip to stamford where i procured a heavy glasscutting tool for my primary idea was to remove the ancient and magically potent mirror from its later settingmy next step was to figure out the best time of day to make the crucial experiment i finally settled on twothirty amboth because it was a good season for uninterrupted work and because it was the opposite of twothirty pm the probable moment at which robert had entered the mirror this form of oppositeness may or may not have been relevant but i knew at least that the chosen hour was as good as anyand perhaps better than mosti finally set to work in the early morning of the eleventh day after the disappearance having drawn all the shades of my livingroom and closed and locked the door into the hallway following with breathless care the elliptical line i had traced i worked around the whorlsection with my steelwheeled cutting tool the ancient glass half an inch thick crackled crisply under the firm uniform pressure and upon completing the circuit i cut around it a second time crunching the roller more deeply into the glassthen very carefully indeed i lifted the heavy mirror down from its console and leaned it faceinward against the wall prying off two of the thin narrow boards nailed to the back with equal caution i smartly tapped the cutaround space with the heavy wooden handle of the glasscutterat the very first tap the whorlcontaining section of glass dropped out on the bokhara rug beneath i did not know what might happen but was keyed up for anything and took a deep involuntary breath i was on my knees for convenience at the moment with my face quite near the newly made aperture and as i breathed there poured into my nostrils a powerfuldustyodora smell not comparable to any other i have ever encountered then everything within my range of vision suddenly turned to a dull gray before my failing eyesight as i felt myself overpowered by an invisible force which robbed my muscles of their power to functioni remember grasping weakly and futilely at the edge of the nearest window drapery and feeling it rip loose from its fastening then i sank slowly to the floor as the darkness of oblivion passed over mewhen i regained consciousness i was lying on the bokhara rug with my legs held unaccountably up in the air the room was full of that hideous and inexplicable dusty smelland as my eyes began to take in definite images i saw that robert grandison stood in front of me it was hefully in the flesh and with his coloring normalwho was holding my legs aloft to bring the blood back to my head as the schools firstaid course had taught him to do with persons who had fainted for a moment i was struck mute by the stifling odor and by a bewilderment which quickly merged into a sense of triumph then i found myself able to move and speak collectedlyi raised a tentative hand and waved feebly at robertall right old man i murmured you can let my legs down now many thanks im all right again i think it was the smelli imaginethat got me open that farthest window pleasewidefrom the bottom thats itthanks noleave the shade down the way it wasi struggled to my feet my disturbed circulation adjusting itself in waves and stood upright hanging to the back of a big chair i was still groggy but a blast of fresh bitterly cold air from the window revived me rapidly i sat down in the big chair and looked at robert now walking toward mefirst i said hurriedly tell me robertthose othersholm what happened tothemwhen iopened the exitrobert paused halfway across the room and looked at me very gravelyi saw them fade awayinto nothingnessmr canevin he said with solemnity and with themeverything there isnt any more inside sirthank god and you sirand young robert at last yielding to the sustained strain which he had borne through all those terrible eleven days suddenly broke down like a little child and began to weep hysterically in great stifling dry sobsi picked him up and placed him gently on my davenport threw a rug over him sat down by his side and put a calming hand on his foreheadtake it easy old fellow i said soothinglythe boys sudden and very natural hysteria passed as quickly as it had come on as i talked to him reassuringly about my plans for his quiet restoration to the school the interest of the situation and the need of concealing the incredible truth beneath a rational explanation took hold of his imagination as i had expected and at last he sat up eagerly telling the details of his release and listening to the instructions i had thought out he had it seems been in the projected area of my bedroom when i opened the way back and had emerged in that actual roomhardly realizing that he was out upon hearing a fall in the livingroom he had hastened thither finding me on the rug in my fainting spelli need mention only briefly my method of restoring robert in a seemingly normal wayhow i smuggled him out of the window in an old hat and sweater of mine took him down the road in my quietly started car coached him carefully in a tale i had devised and returned to arouse browne with the news of his discovery he had i explained been walking alone on the afternoon of his disappearance and had been offered a motor ride by two young men who as a joke and over his protests that he could go no farther than stamford and back had begun to carry him past that town jumping from the car during a traffic stop with the intention of hitchhiking back before callover he had been hit by another car just as the traffic was releasedawakening ten days later in the greenwich home of the people who had hit him on learning the date i added he had immediately telephoned the school and i being the only one awake had answered the call and hurried after him in my car without stopping to notify anyonebrowne who at once telephoned to roberts parents accepted my story without question and forbore to interrogate the boy because of the latters manifest exhaustion it was arranged that he should remain at the school for a rest under the expert care of mrs browne a former trained nurse i naturally saw a good deal of him during the remainder of the christmas vacation and was thus enabled to fill in certain gaps in his fragmentary dreamstorynow and then we would almost doubt the actuality of what had occurred wondering whether we had not both shared some monstrous delusion born of the mirrors glittering hypnotism and whether the tale of the ride and accident were not after all the real truth but whenever we did so we would be brought back to belief by some monstrous and haunting memory with me of roberts dreamfigure and its thick voice and inverted colors with him of the whole fantastic pageantry of ancient people and dead scenes that he had witnessed and then there was that joint recollection of that damnable dusty odor we knew what it meant the instant dissolution of those who had entered an alien dimension a century and more agothere are in addition at least two lines of rather more positive evidence one of which comes through my researches in danish annals concerning the sorcerer axel holm such a person indeed left many traces in folklore and written records and diligent library sessions plus conferences with various learned danes have shed much more light on his evil fame at present i need say only that the copenhagen glassblowerborn in 1612was a notorious luciferian whose pursuits and final vanishing formed a matter of awed debate over two centuries ago he had burned with a desire to know all things and to conquer every limitation of mankindto which end he had delved deeply into occult and forbidden fields ever since he was a childhe was commonly held to have joined a coven of the dreaded witchcult and the vast lore of ancient scandinavian mythwith its loki the sly one and the accursed fenriswolfwas soon an open book to him he had strange interests and objectives few of which were definitely known but some of which were recognized as intolerably evil it is recorded that his two negro helpers originally slaves from the danish west indies had become mute soon after their acquisition by him and that they had disappeared not long before his own disappearance from the ken of mankindnear the close of an already long life the idea of a glass of immortality appears to have entered his mind that he had acquired an enchanted mirror of inconceivable antiquity was a matter of common whispering it being alleged that he had purloined it from a fellowsorcerer who had entrusted it to him for polishingthis mirroraccording to popular tales a trophy as potent in its way as the betterknown aegis of minerva or hammer of thorwas a small oval object called lokis glass made of some polished fusible mineral and having magical properties which included the divination of the immediate future and the power to show the possessor his enemies that it had deeper potential properties realizable in the hands of an erudite magician none of the common people doubted and even educated persons attached much fearful importance to holms rumored attempts to incorporate it in a larger glass of immortality then had come the wizards disappearance in 1687 and the final sale and dispersal of his goods amidst a growing cloud of fantastic legendry it was altogether just such a story as one would laugh at if possessed of no particular key yet to me remembering those dream messages and having robert grandisons corroboration before me it formed a positive confirmation of all the bewildering marvels that had been unfoldedbut as i have said there is still another line of rather positive evidenceof a very different characterat my disposal two days after his release as robert greatly improved in strength and appearance was placing a log on my livingroom fire i noticed a certain awkwardness in his motions and was struck by a persistent idea summoning him to my desk i suddenly asked him to pick up an inkstandand was scarcely surprised to note that despite lifelong righthandedness he obeyed unconsciously with his left hand without alarming him i then asked that he unbutton his coat and let me listen to his cardiac action what i found upon placing my ear to his chestand what i did not tell him for some time afterwardwas thathis heart was beating on his right sidehe had gone into the glass righthanded and with all organs in their normal positions now he was lefthanded and with organs reversed and would doubtless continue so for the rest of his life clearly the dimensional transition had been no illusionfor this physical change was tangible and unmistakable had there been a natural exit from the glass robert would probably have undergone a thorough rereversal and emerged in perfect normalityas indeed the colorscheme of his body and clothing did emerge the forcible nature of his release however undoubtedly set something awry so that dimensions no longer had a chance to right themselves as chromatic wavefrequencies still didi had not merelyopenedholms trap i haddestroyedit and at the particular stage of destruction marked by roberts escape some of the reversing properties had perished it is significant that in escaping robert had felt no pain comparable to that experienced in entering had the destruction been still more sudden i shiver to think of the monstrosities of color the boy would always have been forced to bear i may add that after discovering roberts reversal i examined the rumpled and discarded clothing he had worn in the glass and found as i had expected a complete reversal of pockets buttons and all other corresponding detailsat this moment lokis glass just as it fell on my bokhara rug from the now patched and harmless mirror weighs down a sheaf of papers on my writingtable here in st thomas venerable capital of the danish west indiesnow the american virgin islands various collectors of old sandwich glass have mistaken it for an odd bit of that early american productbut i privately realize that my paperweight is an antique of far subtler and more paleogean craftsmanship still i do not disillusion such enthusiasts,1
fata viam invenienton a verdant slope of mount maenalus in arcadia there stands an olive grove about the ruins of a villa close by is a tomb once beautiful with the sublimest sculptures but now fallen into as great decay as the house at one end of that tomb its curious roots displacing the timestained blocks of pentelic marble grows an unnaturally large olive tree of oddly repellent shape so like to some grotesque man or deathdistorted body of a man that the country folk fear to pass it at night when the moon shines faintly through the crooked boughs mount maenalus is a chosen haunt of dreaded pan whose queer companions are many and simple swains believe that the tree must have some hideous kinship to these weird panisci but an old beekeeper who lives in the neighbouring cottage told me a different storymany years ago when the hillside villa was new and resplendent there dwelt within it the two sculptors kalos and musides from lydia to neapolis the beauty of their work was praised and none dared say that the one excelled the other in skill the hermes of kalos stood in a marble shrine in corinth and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar in athens near the parthenon all men paid homage to kalos and musides and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of their brotherly friendshipbut though kalos and musides dwelt in unbroken harmony their natures were not alike whilst musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of tegea kalos would remain at home stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove there he would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind and there devise the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble idle folk indeed said that kalos conversed with the spirits of the grove and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he met therefor he patterned his work after no living modelso famous were kalos and musides that none wondered when the tyrant of syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of tych which he had planned for his city of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue be for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance and for this honour kalos and musides were invited to compete their brotherly love was well known and the crafty tyrant surmised that each instead of concealing his work from the other would offer aid and advice this charity producing two images of unheardof beauty the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams of poetswith joy the sculptors hailed the tyrants offer so that in the days that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels not from each other did kalos and musides conceal their work but the sight was for them alone saving theirs no eyes beheld the two divine figures released by skilful blows from the rough blocks that had imprisoned them since the world beganat night as of yore musides sought the banquet halls of tegea whilst kalos wandered alone in the olive grove but as time passed men observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling musides it was strange they said amongst themselves that depression should thus seize one with so great a chance to win arts loftiest reward many months passed yet in the sour face of musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arousethen one day musides spoke of the illness of kalos after which none marvelled again at his sadness since the sculptors attachment was known to be deep and sacred subsequently many went to visit kalos and indeed noticed the pallor of his face but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of musideswho was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of tych little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful attendantas kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved there he would ask to be left alone as if wishing to speak with unseen things musides ever granted his requests though his eyes filled with visible tears at the thought that kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than for him at last the end drew near and kalos discoursed of things beyond this life musides weeping promised him a sepulchre more lovely than the tomb of mausolus but kalos bade him speak no more of marble glories only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his restingplaceclose to his head and one night sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove kalos diedbeautiful beyond words was the marble sepulchre which stricken musides carved for his beloved friend none but kalos himself could have fashioned such basreliefs wherein were displayed all the splendours of elysium nor did musides fail to bury close to kalos head the olive twigs from the groveas the first violence of musides grief gave place to resignation he laboured with diligence upon his figure of tych all honour was now his since the tyrant of syracuse would have the work of none save him or kalos his task proved a vent for his emotion and he toiled more steadily each day shunning the gaieties he once had relished meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleepers head so swift was the growth of this tree and so strange was its form that all who beheld it exclaimed in surprise and musides seemed at once fascinated and repelledthree years after the death of kalos musides despatched a messenger to the tyrant and it was whispered in the agora at tegea that the mighty statue was finished by this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions exceeding all other trees of its kind and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which musides laboured as many visitors came to view the prodigious tree as to admire the art of the sculptor so that musides was seldom alone but he did not mind his multitude of guests indeed he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done the bleak mountain wind sighing through the olive grove and the tombtree had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate soundsthe sky was dark on the evening that the tyrants emissaries came to tegea it was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of tych and bring eternal honour to musides so their reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth as the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of maenalus and the men from far syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town they talked of their illustrious tyrant and of the splendour of his capital and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for him and then the men of tegea spoke of the goodness of musides and of his heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of art could console him in the absence of kalos who might have worn those laurels instead of the tree which grew by the tomb near the head of kalos they also spoke the wind shrieked more horribly and both the syracusans and the arcadians prayed to aiolosin the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrants messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor but the nightwind had done strange things slaves cries ascended from a scene of desolation and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein musides had dreamed and toiled lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins strangers and tegeans stood aghast looking from the wreckage to the great sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of kalos and their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment for of the gentle musides and of the marvellously fashioned image of tych no trace could be discovered amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt and the representatives of two cities left disappointed syracusans that they had no statue to bear home tegeans that they had no artist to crown however the syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in athens and the tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts virtues and brotherly piety of musidesbut the olive grove still stands as does the tree growing out of the tomb of kalos and the old beekeeper told me that sometimes the boughs whisper to one another in the nightwind saying over and over again i know i know,1
isoutheast of hampden near the tortuous salmon river gorge is a range of steep rocky hills which have defied all efforts of sturdy homesteaders the canyons are too deep and the slopes too precipitous to encourage anything save seasonal livestock grazing the last time i visited hampden the regionknown as hells acreswas part of the blue mountain forest reserve there are no roads linking this inaccessible locality with the outside world and the hillfolk will tell you that it is indeed a spot transplanted from his satanic majestys front yard there is a local superstition that the area is hauntedbut by what or by whom no one seems to know natives will not venture within its mysterious depths for they believe the stories handed down to them by the nez perce indians who have shunned the region for untold generations because according to them it is a playground of certain giant devils from the outside these suggestive tales made me very curiousmy first excursionand my last thank godinto those hills occurred while constantine theunis and i were living in hampden the summer of 1938 he was writing a treatise on egyptian mythology and i found myself alone much of the time despite the fact that we shared a modest cabin on beacon street within sight of the infamous pirate house built by exer jones over sixty years agothe morning of june 23rd found me walking in those oddly shaped hills which had since seven oclock seemed very ordinary indeed i must have been about seven miles south of hampden before i noticed anything unusual i was climbing a grassy ridge overlooking a particularly deep canyon when i came upon an area totally devoid of the usual bunchgrass and greaseweed it extended southward over numerous hills and valleys at first i thought the spot had been burned over the previous fall but upon examining the turf i found no signs of a blaze the nearby slopes and ravines looked terribly scarred and seared as if some gigantic torch had blasted them wiping away all vegetation and yet there was no evidence of fire i moved on over rich black soil in which no grass flourished as i headed for the approximate center of this desolate area i began to notice a strange silence there were no larks no rabbits and even the insects seemed to have deserted the place i gained the summit of a lofty knoll and tried to guess at the size of that bleak inexplicable region then i saw the lone treeit stood on a hill somewhat higher than its companions and attracted the eye because it was so utterly unexpected i had seen no trees for miles thorn and hackberry bushes clustered the shallower ravines but there had been no mature trees strange to find one standing on the crest of the hilli crossed two steep canyons before i came to it and a surprise awaited me it was not a pine tree nor a fir tree nor a hackberry tree i had never in all my life seen one to compare with itand i never have to this day for which i am eternally thankfulmore than anything it resembled an oak it had a huge twisted trunk fully a yard in diameter and the large limbs began spreading outward scarcely seven feet from the ground the leaves were round and curiously alike in size and design it might have been a tree painted on a canvas but i will swear that it was real i shall always know that itwasreal despite what theunis said lateri recall that i glanced at the sun and judged the time to be about ten oclock am although i did not look at my watch the day was becoming warm and i sat for a while in the welcome shade of the huge tree then i regarded the rank grass that flourished beneath itanother singular phenomenon when i remembered the bleak terrain through which i had passed a wild maze of hills ravines and bluffs hemmed me in on all sides although the rise on which i sat was rather higher than any other within miles i looked far to the eastand i jumped to my feet startled and amazed shimmering through a blue haze of distance were the bitterroot mountains there is no other range of snowcapped peaks within three hundred miles of hampden and i knewat this altitudethat i shouldnt be seeing them at all for several minutes i gazed at the marvel then i became drowsy i lay in the rank grass beneath the tree i unstrapped my camera took off my hat and relaxed staring skyward through the green leaves i closed my eyesthen a curious phenomenon began to assail mea vague cloudy sort of visionglimpsing or daydreaming seemingly without relevance to anything familiar i thought i saw a great temple by a sea of ooze where three suns gleamed in a pale red sky the vast tomb or temple was an anomalous colora nameless blueviolet shade large beasts flew in the cloudy sky and i seemed to hear the pounding of their scaly wings i went nearer the stone temple and a huge doorway loomed in front of me within that portal were swirling shadows that seemed to dart and leer and try to snatch me inside that awful darkness i thought i saw three flaming eyes in the shifting void of a doorway and i screamed with mortal fear in that noisome depth i knew lurked utter destructiona living hell even worse than death i screamed again the vision fadedi saw the round leaves and the sane earthly sky i struggled to rise i was trembling cold perspiration beaded my brow i had a mad impulse to flee run insanely from that sinister tree on the hillbut i checked the absurd intuition and sat down trying to collect my senses never had i dreamed anything so realistic so horrifying what had caused the vision i had been reading several of theunis tomes on ancient egypt i mopped my forehead and decided that it was time for lunch but i did not feel like eatingthen i had an inspiration i would take a few snapshots of the tree for theunis they might shock him out of his habitual air of unconcern perhaps i would tell him about the dream opening my camera i took half a dozen shots of the tree and every aspect of the landscape as seen from the tree also i included one of the gleaming snowcrested peaks i might want to return and these photos would help folding the camera i returned to my cushion of soft grass had that spot beneath the tree a certain alien enchantment i know that i was reluctant to leave it i gazed upward at the curious round leaves i closed my eyes a breeze stirred the branches and their whispered music lulled me into tranquil oblivion and suddenly i saw again the pale red sky and the three suns the land of three shadows again the great temple came into view i seemed to be floating on the aira disembodied spirit exploring the wonders of a mad multidimensional world the temples oddly angled cornices frightened me and i knew that this place was one that no man on earth had ever seen in his wildest dreamsagain the vast doorway yawned before me and i was sucked within that black writhing cloud i seemed to be staring at space unlimited i saw a void beyond my vocabulary to describe a dark bottomless gulf teeming with nameless shapes and entitiesthings of madness and delirium as tenuous as a mist from shamballahmy soul shrank i was terribly afraid i screamed and screamed and felt that i would soon go mad then in my dream i ran and ran in a fever of utter terror but i did not know what i was running from i left that hideous temple and that hellish void yet i knew i must barring some miracle return at last my eyes flew open i was not beneath the tree i was sprawled on a rocky slope my clothing torn and disordered my hands were bleeding i stood up pain stabbing through me i recognized the spotthe ridge where i had first seen the blasted area i must have walked milesunconscious the tree was not in sight and i was glad even the knees of my trousers were torn as if i had crawled part of the way i glanced at the sun late afternoonwherehad i been i snatched out my watch it had stopped at 1034 iiso you have the snapshots theunis drawled i met his gray eyes across the breakfast table three days had slipped by since my return from hells acres i had told him about the dream beneath the tree and he had laughedyes i replied they came last night havent had a chance to open them yet give em a good careful studyif they arent all failures perhaps youll change your mindtheunis smiled sipped his coffee i gave him the unopened envelope and he quickly broke the seal and withdrew the pictures he glanced at the first one and the smile faded from his leonine face he crushed out his cigarettemy god man look at thisi seized the glossy rectangle it was the first picture of the tree taken at a distance of fifty feet or so the cause of theunis excitement escaped me there it was standing boldly on the hill while below it grew the jungle of grass where i had lain in the distance were my snowcapped mountainsthere you are i cried the proof of my storylook at it theunis snapped the shadowsthere are three for every rock bush and treehe was right below the tree spread in fanlike incongruity lay three overlapping shadows suddenly i realized that the picture held an abnormal and inconsistent element the leaves on the thing were too lush for the work of sane nature while the trunk was bulged and knotted in the most abhorrent shapes theunis dropped the picture on the tablethere is something wrong i muttered the tree i saw didnt look as repulsive as thatare you sure theunis grated the fact is you may have seen many things not recorded on this filmit shows more than i sawthats the point there is something damnably out of place in this landscape something i cant understand the tree seems to suggest a thoughtbeyond my grasp it is too misty too uncertain too unreal to be natural he rapped nervous fingers on the table he snatched the remaining films and shuffled through them rapidlyi reached for the snapshot he had dropped and sensed a touch of bizarre uncertainty and strangeness as my eyes absorbed its every detail the flowers and weeds pointed at varying angles while some of the grass grew in the most bewildering fashion the tree seemed too veiled and clouded to be readily distinguished but i noted the huge limbs and the halfbent flower stems that were ready to fall over yet did not fall and the many overlapping shadows they were altogether very disquieting shadowstoo long or short when compared to the stems they fell below to give one a feeling of comfortable normality the landscape hadnt shocked me the day of my visit there was a dark familiarity and mocking suggestion in it something tangible yet distant as the stars beyond the galaxytheunis came back to earth did you mentionthreesuns in your dreaming orgyi nodded frankly puzzled then it dawned on me my fingers trembled slightly as i stared at the picture again my dream of coursethe others are just like it theunis said that same uncertainness thatsuggestioni should be able to catch the mood of the thing see it in its real light but it is too perhaps later i shall find out if i look at it long enoughwe sat in silence for some time a thought came to me suddenly prompted by a strange inexplicable longing to visit the tree again lets make an excursion i think i can take you there in half a dayyoud better stay away replied theunis thoughtfully i doubt if you could find the place again if you wanted tononsense i replied surely with these photos to guide usdid you see any familiar landmarks in themhis observation was uncanny after looking through the remaining snaps carefully i had to admit that there were nonetheunis muttered under his breath and drew viciously on his cigarette a perfectly normalor nearly sopicture of a spot apparently dropped from nowhere seeing mountains at this low altitude is preposterous but waithe sprang from the chair as a hunted animal and raced from the room i could hear him moving about in our makeshift library cursing volubly before long he reappeared with an old leatherbound volume theunis opened it reverently and peered over the odd characterswhat do you call that i inquiredthis is an early english translation of thechronicle of nathwritten by rudolf yergler a german mystic and alchemist who borrowed some of his lore from hermes trismegistus the ancient egyptian sorcerer there is a passage here that might interest youmight make you understand why this business is even further from the natural than you suspect listenso in the year of the black goat there came unto nath a shadow that should not be on earth and that had no form known to the eyes of earth and it fed on the souls of men they that it gnawed being lured and blinded with dreams till the horror and the endless night lay upon them nor did they see that which gnawed them for the shadow took false shapes that men know or dream of and only freedom seemed waiting in the land of the three suns but it was told by priests of the old book that he who could see the shadows true shape and live after the seeing might shun its doom and send it back to the starless gulf of its spawning this none could do save through the gem wherefore did kanefer the highpriest keep that gem sacred in the temple and when it was lost with phrenes he who braved the horror and was never seen more there was weeping in nath yet did the shadow depart sated at last nor shall it hunger again till the cycles roll back to the year of the black goattheunis paused while i stared bewildered finally he spoke now single i suppose you can guess how all this links up there is no need of going deep into the primal lore behind this business but i may as well tell you that according to the old legends this is the socalled year of the black goatwhen certain horrors from the fathomless outside are supposed to visit the earth and do infinite harm we dont know how theyll be manifest but theres reason to think that strange mirages and hallucinations will be mixed up in the matter i dont like the thing youve run up againstthe story or the pictures it may be pretty bad and i warn you to look out but first i must try to do what old yergler saysto see if i can glimpse the matter as it is fortunately the old gem he mentions has been rediscoveredi know where i can get at it we must use it on the photographs and see what we seeits more or less like a lens or prism though one cant take photographs with it someone of peculiar sensitiveness might look through and sketch what he sees theres a bit of danger and the looker may have his consciousness shaken a trifle for the real shape of the shadow isnt pleasant and doesnt belong on this earth but it would be a lot more dangerous not to do anything about it meanwhile if you value your life and sanity keep away from that hilland from the thing you think is a tree on iti was more bewildered than ever how can there be organized beings from the outside in our midst i cried how do we know that such things existyou reason in terms of this tiny earth theunis said surely you dont think that the world is a rule for measuring the universe there are entities we never dream of floating under our very noses modern science is thrusting back the borderland of the unknown and proving that the mystics were not so far off the tracksuddenly i knew that i did not want to look at the picture again i wanted to destroy it i wanted to run from it theunis was suggesting something beyond a trembling cosmic fear gripped me and drew me away from the hideous picture for i was afraid i would recognize some object in it i glanced at my friend he was poring over the ancient book a strange expression on his face he sat up straight lets call the thing off for today im tired of this endless guessing and wondering i must get the loan of the gem from the museum where it is and do what is to be doneas you say i replied will you have to go to croydonhe noddedthen well both go home i said decisivelyiiii need not chronicle the events of the fortnight that followed with me they formed a constant and enervating struggle between a mad longing to return to the cryptic tree of dreams and freedom and a frenzied dread of that selfsame thing and all connected with it that i did not return is perhaps less a matter of my own will than a matter of pure chance meanwhile i knew that theunis was desperately active in some investigation of the strangest naturesomething which included a mysterious motor trip and a return under circumstances of the greatest secrecy by hints over the telephone i was made to understand that he had somewhere borrowed the obscure and primal object mentioned in the ancient volume as the gem and that he was busy devising a means of applying it to the photographs i had left with him he spoke fragmentarily of refraction polarization and unknown angles of space and time and indicated that he was building a kind of box or camera obscura for the study of the curious snapshots with the gems aidit was on the sixteenth day that i received the startling message from the hospital in croydon theunis was there and wanted to see me at once he had suffered some odd sort of seizure being found prone and unconscious by friends who found their way into his house after hearing certain cries of mortal agony and fear though still weak and helpless he had now regained his senses and seemed frantic to tell me something and have me perform certain important duties this much the hospital informed me over the wire and within half an hour i was at my friends bedside marveling at the inroads which worry and tension had made on his features in so brief a time his first act was to move away the nurses in order to speak in utter confidencesinglei saw it his voice was strained and husky you must destroy them allthose pictures i sent it back by seeing it but the pictures had better go that tree will never be seen on the hill againat least i hope nottill thousands of eons bring back the year of the black goat you are safe nowmankind is safe he paused breathing heavily and continuedtake the gem out of the apparatus and put it in the safeyou know the combination it must go back where it came from for theres a time when it may be needed to save the world they wont let me leave here yet but i can rest if i know its safe dont look through the box as it isit would fix you as its fixed me and burn those damned photographs the one in the box and the others but theunis was exhausted now and the nurses advanced and motioned me away as he leaned back and closed his eyesin another halfhour i was at his house and looking curiously at the long black box on the library table beside the overturned chair scattered papers blew about in a breeze from the open window and close to the box i recognized with a queer sensation the envelope of pictures i had taken it required only a moment for me to examine the box and detach at one end my earliest picture of the tree and at the other end a strange bit of ambercolored crystal cut in devious angles impossible to classify the touch of the glass fragment seemed curiously warm and electric and i could scarcely bear to put it out of sight in theunis wall safe the snapshot i handled with a disconcerting mixture of emotions even after i had replaced it in the envelope with the rest i had a morbid longing to save it and gloat over it and rush out and up the hill toward its original peculiar linearrangements sprang out of its details to assault and puzzle my memory pictures behind pictures secrets lurking in halffamiliar shapes but a saner contrary instinct operating at the same time gave me the vigor and avidity of unplaceable fear as i hastily kindled a fire in the grate and watched the problematic envelope burn to ashes somehow i felt that the earth had been purged of a horror on whose brink i had trembled and which was none the less monstrous because i did not know what it wasof the source of theunis terrific shock i could form no coherent guess nor did i dare to think too closely about it it is notable that i did not at any time have the least impulse to look through the box before removing the gem and photograph what was shown in the picture by the antique crystals lens or prismlike power was not i felt curiously certain anything that a normal brain ought to be called upon to face whatever it was i had myself been close to ithad been completely under the spell of its allurementas it brooded on that remote hill in the form of a tree and an unfamiliar landscape and i did not wish to know what i had so narrowly escapedwould that my ignorance might have remained complete i could sleep better at night as it was my eye was arrested before i left the room by the pile of scattered papers rustling on the table beside the black box all but one were blank but that one bore a crude drawing in pencil suddenly recalling what theunis had once said about sketching the horror revealed by the gem i strove to turn away but sheer curiosity defeated my sane design looking again almost furtively i observed the nervous haste of the strokes and the unfinished edge left by the sketchers terrified seizure then in a burst of perverse boldness i looked squarely at the dark and forbidden designand fell in a fainti shall never describe fully what i saw after a time i regained my senses thrust the sheet into the dying fire and staggered out through the quiet streets to my home i thanked god that i had not looked through the crystal at the photograph and prayed fervently that i might forget the drawings terrible hint of what theunis had beheld since then i have never been quite the same even the fairest scenes have seemed to hold some vague ambiguous hint of the nameless blasphemies which may underlie them and form their masquerading essence and yet the sketch was so slightso little indicative of all that theunis to judge from his guarded accounts later on must have discernedonly a few basic elements of the landscape were in the thing for the most part a cloudy exoticlooking vapor dominated the view every object that might have been familiar was seen to be part of something vague and unknown and altogether unterrestrialsomething infinitely vaster than any human eye could grasp and infinitely alien monstrous and hideous as guessed from the fragment within rangewhere i had in the landscape itself seen the twisted halfsentient tree there was here visible only a gnarled terrible hand or talon with fingers or feelers shockingly distended and evidently groping toward something on the ground or in the spectators direction and squarely below the writhing bloated digits i thought i saw an outline in the grass where a man had lain but the sketch was hasty and i could not be sure,1
not all of the few remaining inhabitants of daalbergen that dismal little village in the ramapo mountains believe that my uncle old dominie vanderhoof is really dead some of them believe he is suspended somewhere between heaven and hell because of the old sextons curse if it had not been for that old magician he might still be preaching in the little damp church across the moorafter what has happened to me in daalbergen i can almost share the opinion of the villagers i am not sure that my uncle is dead but i am very sure that he is not alive upon this earth there is no doubt that the old sexton buried him once but he is not in that grave now i can almost feel him behind me as i write impelling me to tell the truth about those strange happenings in daalbergen so many years agoit was the fourth day of october when i arrived at daalbergen in answer to a summons the letter was from a former member of my uncles congregation who wrote that the old man had passed away and that there should be some small estate which i as his only living relative might inherit having reached the secluded little hamlet by a wearying series of changes on branch railways i found my way to the grocery store of mark haines writer of the letter and he leading me into a stuffy back room told me a peculiar tale concerning dominie vanderhoofs deathy should be careful hoffman haines told me when y meet that old sexton abel foster hes in league with the devil sures youre alive twant two weeks ago sam pryor when he passed the old graveyard heared him mumblin t the dead there twant right he should talk that wayan sam does vow that there was a voice answered hima kind o halfvoice hollow and muffledlike as though it come out o th ground theres others too as could tell y about seein him standin afore old dominie slotts gravethat one right agin the church wallawringin his hands an atalkin t th moss on th tombstone as though it was the old dominie himselfold foster haines said had come to daalbergen about ten years before and had been immediately engaged by vanderhoof to take care of the damp stone church at which most of the villagers worshipped no one but vanderhoof seemed to like him for his presence brought a suggestion almost of the uncanny he would sometimes stand by the door when the people came to church and the men would coldly return his servile bow while the women brushed past in haste holding their skirts aside to avoid touching him he could be seen on week days cutting the grass in the cemetery and tending the flowers around the graves now and then crooning and muttering to himself and few failed to notice the particular attention he paid to the grave of the reverend guilliam slott first pastor of the church in 1701it was not long after fosters establishment as a village fixture that disaster began to lower first came the failure of the mountain mine where most of the men worked the vein of iron had given out and many of the people moved away to better localities while those who had large holdings of land in the vicinity took to farming and managed to wrest a meager living from the rocky hillsides then came the disturbances in the church it was whispered about that the reverend johannes vanderhoof had made a compact with the devil and was preaching his word in the house of god his sermons had become weird and grotesqueredolent with sinister things which the ignorant people of daalbergen did not understand he transported them back over ages of fear and superstition to regions of hideous unseen spirits and peopled their fancy with nighthaunting ghouls one by one the congregation dwindled while the elders and deacons vainly pleaded with vanderhoof to change the subject of his sermons though the old man continually promised to comply he seemed to be enthralled by some higher power which forced him to do its willa giant in stature johannes vanderhoof was known to be weak and timid at heart yet even when threatened with expulsion he continued his eerie sermons until scarcely a handful of people remained to listen to him on sunday morning because of weak finances it was found impossible to call a new pastor and before long not one of the villagers dared venture near the church or the parsonage which adjoined it everywhere there was fear of those spectral wraiths with whom vanderhoof was apparently in leaguemy uncle mark haines told me had continued to live in the parsonage because there was no one with sufficient courage to tell him to move out of it no one ever saw him again but lights were visible in the parsonage at night and were even glimpsed in the church from time to time it was whispered about the town that vanderhoof preached regularly in the church every sunday morning unaware that his congregation was no longer there to listen he had only the old sexton who lived in the basement of the church to take care of him and foster made a weekly visit to what remained of the business section of the village to buy provisions he no longer bowed servilely to everyone he met but instead seemed to harbor a demoniac and illconcealed hatred he spoke to no one except as was necessary to make his purchases and glanced from left to right out of evilfilled eyes as he walked the street with his cane tapping the uneven pavements bent and shriveled with extreme age his presence could actually be felt by anyone near him so powerful was that personality which said the townspeople had made vanderhoof accept the devil as his master no person in daalbergen doubted that abel foster was at the bottom of all the towns ill luck but not a one dared lift a finger against him or could even approach him without a tremor of fear his name as well as vanderhoofs was never mentioned aloud whenever the matter of the church across the moor was discussed it was in whispers and if the conversation chanced to be nocturnal the whisperers would keep glancing over their shoulders to make sure that nothing shapeless or sinister crept out of the darkness to bear witness to their wordsthe churchyard continued to be kept just as green and beautiful as when the church was in use and the flowers near the graves in the cemetery were tended just as carefully as in times gone by the old sexton could occasionally be seen working there as if still being paid for his services and those who dared venture near said that he maintained a continual conversation with the devil and with those spirits which lurked within the graveyard wallsone morning haines went on to say foster was seen digging a grave where the steeple of the church throws its shadow in the afternoon before the sun goes down behind the mountain and puts the entire village in semitwilight later the church bell silent for months tolled solemnly for a halfhour and at sundown those who were watching from a distance saw foster bring a coffin from the parsonage on a wheelbarrow dump it into the grave with slender ceremony and replace the earth in the holethe sexton came to the village the next morning ahead of his usual weekly schedule and in much better spirits than was customary he seemed willing to talk remarking that vanderhoof had died the day before and that he had buried his body beside that of dominie slott near the church wall he smiled from time to time and rubbed his hands in an untimely and unaccountable glee it was apparent that he took a perverse and diabolic delight in vanderhoofs death the villagers were conscious of an added uncanniness in his presence and avoided him as much as they could with vanderhoof gone they felt more insecure than ever for the old sexton was now free to cast his worst spells over the town from the church across the moor muttering something in a tongue which no one understood foster made his way back along the road over the swampit was then it seems that mark haines remembered having heard dominie vanderhoof speak of me as his nephew haines accordingly sent for me in the hope that i might know something which would clear up the mystery of my uncles last years i assured my summoner however that i knew nothing about my uncle or his past except that my mother had mentioned him as a man of gigantic physique but with little courage or power of willhaving heard all that haines had to tell me i lowered the front legs of my chair to the floor and looked at my watch it was late afternoonhow far is it out to the church i inquired think i can make it before sunsetsure lad y aint goin out there tnight not t that place the old man trembled noticeably in every limb and half rose from his chair stretching out a lean detaining hand why its plumb foolishness he exclaimedi laughed aside his fears and informed him that come what may i was determined to see the old sexton that evening and get the whole matter over as soon as possible i did not intend to accept the superstitions of ignorant country folk as truth for i was convinced that all i had just heard was merely a chain of events which the overimaginative people of daalbergen had happened to link with their illluck i felt no sense of fear or horror whateverseeing that i was determined to reach my uncles house before nightfall haines ushered me out of his office and reluctantly gave me the few required directions pleading from time to time that i change my mind he shook my hand when i left as though he never expected to see me againtake keer that old devil foster dont git ye he warned again and again i wouldnt go near him after dark fer love nr money no siree he reentered his store solemnly shaking his head while i set out along a road leading to the outskirts of the towni had walked barely two minutes before i sighted the moor of which haines had spoken the road flanked by a whitewashed fence passed over the great swamp which was overgrown with clumps of underbrush dipping down into the dank slimy ooze an odor of deadness and decay filled the air and even in the sunlit afternoon little wisps of vapor could be seen rising from the unhealthful spoton the opposite side of the moor i turned sharply to the left as i had been directed branching from the main road there were several houses in the vicinity i noticed houses which were scarcely more than huts reflecting the extreme poverty of their owners the road here passed under the drooping branches of enormous willows which almost completely shut out the rays of the sun the miasmal odor of the swamp was still in my nostrils and the air was damp and chilly i hurried my pace to get out of that dismal tunnel as soon as possiblepresently i found myself in the light again the sun now hanging like a red ball upon the crest of the mountain was beginning to dip low and there some distance ahead of me bathed in its bloody iridescence stood the lonely church i began to sense that uncanniness which haines had mentioned that feeling of dread which made all daalbergen shun the place the squat stone hulk of the church itself with its blunt steeple seemed like an idol to which the tombstones that surrounded it bowed down and worshipped each with an arched top like the shoulders of a kneeling person while over the whole assemblage the dingy gray parsonage hovered like a wraithi had slowed my pace a trifle as i took in the scene the sun was disappearing behind the mountain very rapidly now and the damp air chilled me turning my coat collar up about my neck i plodded on something caught my eye as i glanced up again in the shadow of the church wall was something whitea thing which seemed to have no definite shape straining my eyes as i came nearer i saw that it was a cross of new timber surmounting a mound of freshly turned earth the discovery sent a new chill through me i realized that this must be my uncles grave but something told me that it was not like the other graves near it it did not seem like adeadgrave in some intangible way it appeared to belivingif a grave can be said to live very close to it i saw as i came nearer was another grave an old mound with a crumbling stone about it dominie slotts tomb i thought remembering hainess storythere was no sign of life anywhere about the place in the semitwilight i climbed the low knoll upon which the parsonage stood and hammered upon the door there was no answer i skirted the house and peered into the windows the whole place seemed desertedthe lowering mountains had made night fall with disarming suddenness the minute the sun was fully hidden i realized that i could see scarcely more than a few feet ahead of me feeling my way carefully i rounded a corner of the house and paused wondering what to do nexteverything was quiet there was not a breath of wind nor were there even the usual noises made by animals in their nocturnal ramblings all dread had been forgotten for a time but in the presence of that sepulchral calm my apprehensions returned i imagined the air peopled with ghastly spirits that pressed around me making the air almost unbreathable i wondered for the hundredth time where the old sexton might beas i stood there half expecting some sinister demon to creep from the shadows i noticed two lighted windows glaring from the belfry of the church i then remembered what haines had told me about fosters living in the basement of the building advancing cautiously through the blackness i found a side door of the church ajarthe interior had a musty and mildewed odor everything i touched was covered with a cold clammy moisture i struck a match and began to explore to discover if i could how to get into the belfry suddenly i stopped in my tracksa snatch of song loud and obscene sung in a voice that was guttural and thick with drink came from above me the match burned my fingers and i dropped it two pinpoints of light pierced the darkness of the farther wall of the church and below them to one side i could see a door outlined where light filtered through its cracks the song stopped as abruptly as it had commenced and there was absolute silence again my heart was thumping and blood racing through my temples had i not been petrified with fear i should have fled immediatelynot caring to light another match i felt my way among the pews until i stood in front of the door so deep was the feeling of depression which had come over me that i felt as though i were acting in a dream my actions were almost involuntarythe door was locked as i found when i turned the knob i hammered upon it for some time but there was no answer the silence was as complete as before feeling around the edge of the door i found the hinges removed the pins from them and allowed the door to fall toward me dim light flooded down a steep flight of steps there was a sickening odor of whisky i could now hear someone stirring in the belfry room above venturing a low halloo i thought i heard a groan in reply and cautiously climbed the stairsmy first glance into that unhallowed place was indeed startling strewn about the little room were old and dusty books and manuscriptsstrange things that bespoke almost unbelievable age on rows of shelves which reached to the ceiling were horrible things in glass jars and bottlessnakes and lizards and bats dust and mold and cobwebs encrusted everything in the center behind a table upon which was a lighted candle a nearly empty bottle of whisky and a glass was a motionless figure with a thin scrawny wrinkled face and wild eyes that stared blankly through me i recognized abel foster the old sexton in an instant he did not move or speak as i came slowly and fearfully toward himmr foster i asked trembling with unaccountable fear when i heard my voice echo within the close confines of the room there was no reply and no movement from the figure behind the table i wondered if he had not drunk himself to insensibility and went behind the table to shake himat the mere touch of my arm upon his shoulder the strange old man started from his chair as though terrified his eyes still having in them that same blank stare were fixed upon me swinging his arms like flails he backed awaydont he screamed dont touch me go backgo backi saw that he was both drunk and struck with some kind of a nameless terror using a soothing tone i told him who i was and why i had come he seemed to understand vaguely and sank back into his chair sitting limp and motionlessi thought ye was him he mumbled i thought ye was him come back fer it hes been atryin t get outatryin t get out sence i put him in there his voice again rose to a scream and he clutched his chair maybe hes got out now maybe hes outi looked about half expecting to see some spectral shape coming up the stairsmaybe whos out i inquiredvanderhoof he shrieked th cross over his grave keeps fallin down in th night every morning the earth is loose and gets harder t pat down hell come out an i wont be able t do nothinforcing him back into the chair i seated myself on a box near him he was trembling in mortal terror with the saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth from time to time i felt that sense of horror which haines had described when he told me of the old sexton truly there was something uncanny about the man his head had now sunk forward upon his breast and he seemed calmer mumbling to himselfi quietly arose and opened a window to let out the fumes of whisky and the musty odor of dead things light from a dim moon just risen made objects below barely visible i could just see dominie vanderhoofs grave from my position in the belfry and blinked my eyes as i gazed at it that crosswastilted i remembered that it had been vertical an hour ago fear took possession of me again i turned quickly foster sat in his chair watching me his glance was saner than beforeso yere vanderhoofs nephew he mumbled in a nasal tone waal ye mights well know it all hell be back arter me afore long he willjus as soon as he can get out o that there grave ye mights well know all about it nowhis terror appeared to have left him he seemed resigned to some horrible fate which he expected any minute his head dropped down upon his chest again and he went on muttering in that nasal monotoneye see all them there books and papers waal they was once dominie slottsdominie slott who was here years ago all them things is got t do with magicblack magic that th old dominie knew afore he come t this country they used t burn em an boil em in oil fer knowin that over there they did but old slott knew and he didnt go fer t tell nobody no sir old slott used to preach here generations ago an he used to come up here an study them books an use all them dead things in jars an pronounce magic curses an things but he didnt let nobody know it no nobody knowed it but dominie slott an meyou i ejaculated leaning across the table toward himthat is me after i learned it his face showed lines of trickery as he answered me i found all this stuff here when i come t be church sexton an i used t read it when i want at work an i soon got t know all about itthe old man droned on while i listened spellbound he told about learning the difficult formulae of demonology so that by means of incantations he could cast spells over human beings he had performed horrible occult rites of his hellish creed calling down anathema upon the town and its inhabitants crazed by his desires he tried to bring the church under his spell but the power of god was too strong finding johannes vanderhoof very weakwilled he bewitched him so that he preached strange and mystic sermons which struck fear into the simple hearts of the country folk from his position in the belfry room he said behind a painting of the temptation of christ which adorned the rear wall of the church he would glare at vanderhoof while he was preaching through holes which were the eyes of the devil in the picture terrified by the uncanny things which were happening in their midst the congregation left one by one and foster was able to do what he pleased with the church and with vanderhoofbut what did you do with him i asked in a hollow voice as the old sexton paused in his confession he burst into a cackle of laughter throwing back his head in drunken gleei took his soul he howled in a tone that set me trembling i took his soul and put it in a bottlein a little black bottle and i buried him but he aint got his soul an he caint go neither t heaven nr hell but hes acomin back after it hes atrying t get out o his grave now i can hear him pushin his way up through the ground hes that strongas the old man had proceeded with his story i had become more and more convinced that he must be telling me the truth and not merely gibbering in drunkenness every detail fitted what haines had told me fear was growing upon me by degrees with the old wizard now shouting with demoniac laughter i was tempted to bolt down the narrow stairway and leave that accursed neighborhood to calm myself i rose and again looked out of the window my eyes nearly started from their sockets when i saw that the cross above vanderhoofs grave had fallen perceptibly since i had last looked at it it was now tilted to an angle of fortyfive degreescant we dig up vanderhoof and restore his soul i asked almost breathlessly feeling that something must be done in a hurry the old man rose from his chair in terrorno no no he screamed hed kill me ive fergot th formula an if he gets out hell be alive without a soul hed kill us bothwhere is the bottle that contains his soul i asked advancing threateningly toward him i felt that some ghastly thing was about to happen which i must do all in my power to preventi wont tell ye ye young whelp he snarled i felt rather than saw a queer light in his eyes as he backed into a corner an dont ye touch me either or yell wish ye hadnti moved a step forward noticing that on a low stool behind him there were two black bottles foster muttered some peculiar words in a low singsong voice everything began to turn gray before my eyes and something within me seemed to be dragged upward trying to get out at my throat i felt my knees become weaklurching forward i caught the old sexton by the throat and with my free arm reached for the bottles on the stool but the old man fell backward striking the stool with his foot and one bottle fell to the floor as i snatched the other there was a flash of blue flame and a sulfurous smell filled the room from the little heap of broken glass a white vapor rose and followed the draft out the windowcurse ye ye rascal sounded a voice that seemed faint and far away foster whom i had released when the bottle broke was crouching against the wall looking smaller and more shriveled than before his face was slowly turning greenishblackcurse ye said the voice again hardly sounding as though it came from his lips im done fer that one in there was minedominie slott took it out two hundred years agohe slid slowly toward the floor gazing at me with hatred in eyes that were rapidly dimming his flesh changed from white to black and then to yellow i saw with horror that his body seemed to be crumbling away and his clothing falling into limp foldsthe bottle in my hand was growing warm i glanced at it fearfully it glowed with a faint phosphorescence stiff with fright i set it upon the table but could not keep my eyes from it there was an ominous moment of silence as its glow became brighter and then there came distinctly to my ears the sound of sliding earth gasping for breath i looked out of the window the moon was now well up in the sky and by its light i could see that the fresh cross above vanderhoofs grave had completely fallen once again there came the sound of trickling gravel and no longer able to control myself i stumbled down the stairs and found my way out of doors falling now and then as i raced over the uneven ground i ran on in abject terror when i had reached the foot of the knoll at the entrance to that gloomy tunnel beneath the willows i heard a horrible roar behind me turning i glanced back toward the church its wall reflected the light of the moon and silhouetted against it was a gigantic loathsome black shadow climbing from my uncles grave and floundering gruesomely toward the churchi told my story to a group of villagers in hainess store the next morning they looked from one to the other with little smiles during my tale i noticed but when i suggested that they accompany me to the spot gave various excuses for not caring to go though there seemed to be a limit to their credulity they cared to run no risks i informed them that i would go alone though i must confess that the project did not appeal to meas i left the store one old man with a long white beard hurried after me and caught my armill go wi ye lad he said it do seem that i once heared my granpap tell o suthin o the sort concernin old dominie slott a queer old man ive heared he were but vanderhoofs been worsedominie vanderhoofs grave was open and deserted when we arrived of course it could have been graverobbers the two of us agreed and yet in the belfry the bottle which i had left upon the table was gone though the fragments of the broken one were found on the floor and upon the heap of yellow dust and crumpled clothing that had once been abel foster were certain immense footprintsafter glancing at some of the books and papers strewn about the belfry room we carried them down the stairs and burned them as something unclean and unholy with a spade which we found in the church basement we filled in the grave of johannes vanderhoof and as an afterthought flung the fallen cross upon the flamesold wives say that now when the moon is full there walks about the churchyard a gigantic and bewildered figure clutching a bottle and seeking some unremembered goal,1
imystery attracts mystery ever since the wide appearance of my name as a performer of unexplained feats i have encountered strange narratives and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities some of these have been trivial and irrelevant some deeply dramatic and absorbing some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and historical research many of these matters i have told and shall continue to tell freely but there is one of which i speak with great reluctance and which i am now relating only after a session of grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine who had heard vague rumours of it from other members of my familythe hitherto guarded subject pertains to my nonprofessional visit to egypt fourteen years ago and has been avoided by me for several reasons for one thing i am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at cairo who cannot be wholly ignorant of them for another thing i dislike to recount an incident in which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part what i sawor thought i sawcertainly did not take place but is rather to be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in egyptology and of the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally prompted these imaginative stimuli magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long pastin january 1910 i had finished a professional engagement in england and signed a contract for a tour of australian theatres a liberal time being allowed for the trip i determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly interests me so accompanied by my wife i drifted pleasantly down the continent and embarked at marseilles on the p o steamermalwabound for port said from that point i proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower egypt before leaving finally for australiathe voyage was an agreeable one and enlivened by many of the amusing incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work i had intended for the sake of quiet travel to keep my name a secret but was goaded into betraying myself by a fellowmagician whose anxiety to astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito i mention this because of its ultimate effectan effect i should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter throughout the nile valley what it did was to herald my identity wherever i subsequently went and deprive my wife and me of all the placid inconspicuousness we had sought travelling to seek curiosities i was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myselfwe had come to egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically impressive but found little enough when the ship edged up to port said and discharged its passengers in small boats low dunes of sand bobbing buoys in shallow water and a drearily european small town with nothing of interest save the great de lesseps statue made us anxious to get on to something more worth our while after some discussion we decided to proceed at once to cairo and the pyramids later going to alexandria for the australian boat and for whatever graecoroman sights that ancient metropolis might presentthe railway journey was tolerable enough and consumed only four hours and a half we saw much of the suez canal whose route we followed as far as ismailiya and later had a taste of old egypt in our glimpse of the restored freshwater canal of the middle empire then at last we saw cairo glimmering through the growing dusk a twinkling constellation which became a blaze as we halted at the great gare centralebut once more disappointment awaited us for all that we beheld was european save the costumes and the crowds a prosaic subway led to a square teeming with carriages taxicabs and trolleycars and gorgeous with electric lights shining on tall buildings whilst the very theatre where i was vainly requested to play and which i later attended as a spectator had recently been renamed the american cosmograph we stopped at shepherds hotel reached in a taxi that sped along broad smartly builtup streets and amidst the perfect service of its restaurant elevators and generally angloamerican luxuries the mysterious east and immemorial past seemed very far awaythe next day however precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the arabian nights atmosphere and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of cairo the bagdad of harounalraschid seemed to live again guided by our baedeker we had struck east past the ezbekiyeh gardens along the mouski in quest of the native quarter and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone whonotwithstanding later developmentswas assuredly a master at his trade not until afterward did i see that i should have applied at the hotel for a licenced guide this man a shaven peculiarly hollowvoiced and relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a pharaoh and called himself abdul reis el drogman appeared to have much power over others of his kind though subsequently the police professed not to know him and to suggest thatreisis merely a name for any person in authority whilst drogman is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word for a leader of tourist partiesdragomanabdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of old cairo is itself a storybook and a dreamlabyrinths of narrow alleys redolent of aromatic secrets arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting above the cobbled streets maelstroms of oriental traffic with strange cries cracking whips rattling carts jingling money and braying donkeys kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes veils turbans and tarbushes watercarriers and dervishes dogs and cats soothsayers and barbers and over all the whining of blind beggars crouched in alcoves and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep unchanging bluethe roofed quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring spice perfume incense beads rugs silks and brassold mahmoud suleiman squats crosslegged amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverise mustard in the hollowedout capital of an ancient classic columna roman corinthian perhaps from neighbouring heliopolis where augustus stationed one of his three egyptian legions antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism and then the mosques and the museumwe saw them all and tried not to let our arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of pharaonic egypt which the museums priceless treasures offered that was to be our climax and for the present we concentrated on the mediaeval saracenic glories of the caliphs whose magnificent tombmosques form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the arabian desertat length abdul took us along the sharia mohammed ali to the ancient mosque of sultan hassan and the towerflanked babelazab beyond which climbs the steepwalled pass to the mighty citadel that saladin himself built with the stones of forgotten pyramids it was sunset when we scaled that cliff circled the modern mosque of mohammed ali and looked down from the dizzying parapet over mystic cairomystic cairo all golden with its carven domes its ethereal minarets and its flaming gardens far over the city towered the great roman dome of the new museum and beyond itacross the cryptic yellow nile that is the mother of aeons and dynastieslurked the menacing sands of the libyan desert undulant and iridescent and evil with older arcana the red sun sank low bringing the relentless chill of egyptian dusk and as it stood poised on the worlds rim like that ancient god of heliopolisreharakhte the horizonsunwe saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the pyramids of gizehthe palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when tutankhamen mounted his golden throne in distant thebes then we knew that we were done with saracen cairo and that we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal egyptthe black khem of re and amen isis and osiristhe next morning we visited the pyramids riding out in a victoria across the great nile bridge with its bronze lions the island of ghizereh with its massive lebbakh trees and the smaller english bridge to the western shore down the shore road we drove between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast zological gardens to the suburb of gizeh where a new bridge to cairo proper has since been built then turning inland along the shariaelharam we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till before us loomed the objects of our quest cleaving the mists of dawn and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools forty centuries as napoleon had told his campaigners there indeed looked down upon usthe road now rose abruptly till we finally reached our place of transfer between the trolley station and the mena house hotel abdul reis who capably purchased our pyramid tickets seemed to have an understanding with the crowding yelling and offensive bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveller for he kept them very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us himself mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys more expensive than useful the area to be traversed was so small that camels were hardly needed but we did not regret adding to our experience this troublesome form of desert navigationthe pyramids stand on a high rock plateau this group forming next to the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the neighbourhood of the extinct capital memphis which lay on the same side of the nile somewhat south of gizeh and which flourished between 3400 and 2000 b c the greatest pyramid which lies nearest the modern road was built by king cheops or khufu about 2800 b c and stands more than 450 feet in perpendicular height in a line southwest from this are successively the second pyramid built a generation later by king khephren and though slightly smaller looking even larger because set on higher ground and the radically smaller third pyramid of king mycerinus built about 2700 b c near the edge of the plateau and due east of the second pyramid with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of khephren its royal restorer stands the monstrous sphinxmute sardonic and wise beyond mankind and memoryminor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several places and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than royal rank these latter were originally marked bymastabasor stone benchlike structures about the deep burial shafts as found in other memphian cemeteries and exemplified by pernebs tomb in the metropolitan museum of new york at gizeh however all such visible things have been swept away by time and pillage and only the rockhewn shafts either sandfilled or cleared out by archaeologists remain to attest their former existence connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the hoveringkaor vital principle of the deceased the small tombs have their chapels contained in their stonemastabasor superstructures but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids where regal pharaohs lay were separate temples each to the east of its corresponding pyramid and connected by a causeway to a massive gatechapel or propylon at the edge of the rock plateauthe gatechapel leading to the second pyramid nearly buried in the drifting sands yawns subterraneously southeast of the sphinx persistent tradition dubs it the temple of the sphinx and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the sphinx indeed represents the second pyramids builder khephren there are unpleasant tales of the sphinx before khephrenbut whatever its elder features were the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus without fear it was in the great gatewaytemple that the lifesize diorite statue of khephren now in the cairo museum was found a statue before which i stood in awe when i beheld it whether the whole edifice is now excavated i am not certain but in 1910 most of it was below ground with the entrance heavily barred at night germans were in charge of the work and the war or other things may have stopped them i would give much in view of my experience and of certain bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in cairo to know what has developed in connexion with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of the pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboonsthe road as we traversed it on our camels that morning curved sharply past the wooden police quarters postoffice drugstore and shops on the left and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the great pyramid past cyclopean masonry we rode rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal nile glistened to the east and the eternal desert shimmered to the west very close loomed the three major pyramids the greatest devoid of outer casing and shewing its bulk of great stones but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering which had made them smooth and finished in their daypresently we descended toward the sphinx and sat silent beneath the spell of those terrible unseeing eyes on the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the emblem of reharakhte for whose image the sphinx was mistaken in a late dynasty and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws we recalled what thutmosis iv inscribed thereon and the dream he had when a prince it was then that the smile of the sphinx vaguely displeased us and made us wonder about the legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature leading down down to depths none might dare hint atdepths connected with mysteries older than the dynastic egypt we excavate and having a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal animalheaded gods in the ancient nilotic pantheon then too it was i asked myself an idle question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hourother tourists now began to overtake us and we moved on to the sandchoked temple of the sphinx fifty yards to the southeast which i have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the second pyramids mortuary chapel on the plateau most of it was still underground and although we dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall i felt that abdul and the local german attendant had not shewn us all there was to see after this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau examining the second pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east the third pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the fourth and fifth dynasties and the famous campells tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for 53 feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our cameldrivers divested of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by ropecries now assailed us from the great pyramid where bedouins were besieging a party of tourists with offers of guidance to the top or of displays of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and down seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent but many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite impetus of liberalbaksheeshthey did not get this impetus though we did let abdul take us up thus obtaining a view of unprecedented magnificence which included not only remote and glittering cairo with its crowned citadel and background of goldviolet hills but all the pyramids of the memphian district as well from abu roash on the north to the dashur on the south the sakkara steppyramid which marks the evolution of the lowmastabainto the true pyramid shewed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance it is close to this transitionmonument that the famed tomb of perneb was foundmore than 400 miles north of the theban rock valley where tutankhamen sleeps again i was forced to silence through sheer awe the prospect of such antiquity and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood over filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave mefatigued by our climb and disgusted with the importunate bedouins whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste we omitted the arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through cheops mightiest memorial as we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to cairo with abdul reis under the afternoon sun we half regretted the omission we had made such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid passages not in the guidebooks passages whose entrances had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them of course this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it but it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the pyramids at night or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the great pyramid perhaps in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was fearedthe effect on the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry joined to the life he has known by the merest tube in which he may only crawl and which any accident or evil design might block the whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity for me this opportunity came much earlier than i expectedthat evening the members of our party feeling somewhat tired after the strenuous programme of the day i went alone with abdul reis for a walk through the picturesque arab quarter though i had seen it by day i wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamour and fantastic illusion the native crowds were thinning but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of revelling bedouins in the sukennahhasin or bazaar of the coppersmiths their apparent leader an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush took some notice of us and evidently recognised with no great friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide perhaps i thought he resented that odd reproduction of the sphinxs halfsmile which i had often remarked with amused irritation or perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of abduls voice at any rate the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk and before long ali ziz as i heard the stranger called when called by no worse name began to pull violently at abduls robe an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and would have reached an even direr condition had i not intervened and separated them by main forcemy interference at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides succeeded at last in effecting a truce sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire and with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden the two formed a curious pact of honour which i soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in cairoa pact for the settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop the great pyramid long after the departure of the last moonlight sightseer each duellist was to assemble a party of seconds and the affair was to begin at midnight proceeding by rounds in the most civilised possible fashion in all this planning there was much which excited my interest the fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular while the thought of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every fibre of imagination in me a request found abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds so that all the rest of the early evening i accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions of the townmostly northeast of the ezbekiyehwhere he gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his pugilistic backgroundshortly after nine our party mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or touristreminiscent names as rameses mark twain j p morgan and minnehaha edged through street labyrinths both oriental and occidental crossed the muddy and mastforested nile by the bridge of the bronze lions and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to gizeh slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists saluted the last inbound trolleycar and were alone with the night and the past and the spectral moonthen we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue ghoulish with a dim atavistical menace which i had not seemed to notice in the daytime even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastlyfor was it not in this that they had buried queen nitokris alive in the sixth dynasty subtle queen nitokris who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the nile and drowned them by opening the watergates i recalled that the arabs whisper things about nitokris and shun the third pyramid at certain phases of the moon it must have been over her that thomas moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by memphian boatmenthe subterranean nymph that dwellsmid sunless gems and glories hidthe lady of the pyramidearly as we were ali ziz and his party were ahead of us for we saw their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at kafrelharam toward which squalid arab settlement close to the sphinx we had diverged instead of following the regular road to the mena house where some of the sleepy inefficient police might have observed and halted us here where filthy bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of khephrens courtiers we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the great pyramid up whose timeworn sides the arabs swarmed eagerly abdul reis offering me the assistance i did not needas most travellers know the actual apex of this structure has long been worn away leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square on this eerie pinnacle a squared circle was formed and in a few moments the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which but for the quality of the ringside cries might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in america as i watched it i felt that some of our less desirable institutions were not lacking for every blow feint and defence bespoke stalling to my not inexperienced eye it was quickly over and despite my misgivings as to methods i felt a sort of proprietary pride when abdul reis was adjudged the winnerreconciliation was phenomenally rapid and amidst the singing fraternising and drinking which followed i found it difficult to realise that a quarrel had ever occurred oddly enough i myself seemed to be more of a centre of notice than the antagonists and from my smattering of arabic i judged that they were discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me but a distinct hostility and scepticism concerning my feats of escape it gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of egypt did not depart without leaving traces and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly cultpractices have survived surreptitiously amongst the fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed i thought of how much my hollowvoiced guide abdul reis looked like an old egyptian priest or pharaoh or smiling sphinx and wonderedsuddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby i had accepted this nights events as other than the empty and malicious frameup they now shewed themselves to be without warning and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign from abdul the entire band of bedouins precipitated itself upon me and having produced heavy ropes soon had me bound as securely as i was ever bound in the course of my life either on the stage or off i struggled at first but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians my hands were tied behind my back my knees bent to their fullest extent and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords a stifling gag was forced into my mouth and a blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes then as the arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid i heard the taunts of my late guide abdul who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice and assured me that i was soon to have my magic powers put to a supreme test which would quickly remove any egotism i might have gained through triumphing over all the tests offered by america and europe egypt he reminded me is very old and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today whose devices had so uniformly failed to entrap mehow far or in what direction i was carried i cannot tell for the circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment i know however that it could not have been a great distance since my bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time it is this perplexing brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever i think of gizeh and its plateaufor one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist routes of what existed then and must exist stillthe evil abnormality i speak of did not become manifest at first setting me down on a surface which i recognised as sand rather than rock my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in the ground into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling for apparent aeons i bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which i took to be one of the numerous burial shafts of the plateau until the prodigious almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecturethe horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second that any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core of the planet itself or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless profundities of nether earth were beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to accept them even now i am uncertain for i know how deceitful the sense of time becomes when one or more of the usual perceptions or conditions of life is removed or distorted but i am quite sure that i preserved a logical consciousness that far that at least i did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucinationall this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting the shocking ordeal was cumulative and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase in my rate of descent they were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly now and i scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as i shot madly downward my clothing was in tatters and i felt the trickle of blood all over even above the mounting and excruciating pain my nostrils too were assailed by a scarcely definable menace a creeping odour of damp and staleness curiously unlike anything i had ever smelt before and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of mockerythen the mental cataclysm came it was horriblehideous beyond all articulate description because it was all of the soul with nothing of detail to describe it was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish the suddenness of it was apocalyptic and daemoniacone moment i was plunging agonisingly down that narrow well of milliontoothed torture yet the next moment i was soaring on batwings in the gulfs of hell swinging free and swoopingly through illimitable miles of boundless musty space rising dizzily to measureless pinnacles of chilling ether then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous nauseous lower vacua thank god for the mercy that shut out in oblivion those clawing furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties and tore harpylike at my spirit that one respite short as it was gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the road aheadiiit was very gradually that i regained my senses after that eldritch flight through stygian space the process was infinitely painful and coloured by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment the precise nature of these dreams was very clear while i was experiencing them but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward and was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible eventsreal or imaginarywhich followed i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw a yellow hairy fiveclawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulf me and when i stopped to reflect what the paw was it seemed to me that it was egypt in the dream i looked back at the events of the preceding weeks and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little subtly and insidiously by some hellish ghoulspirit of the elder nile sorcery some spirit that was in egypt before ever man was and that will be when man is no morei saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of egypt and the grisly alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead i saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls falcons cats and ibises phantom processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly and offering unnamable sacrifices to indescribable gods stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch and behind it all i saw the ineffable malignity of primordial necromancy black and amorphous and fumbling greedily after me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by emulation in my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and pursuit and i saw the black soul of egypt singling me out and calling me in inaudible whispers calling and luring me leading me on with the glitter and glamour of a saracenic surface but ever pulling me down to the agemad catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heartthen the dreamfaces took on human resemblances and i saw my guide abdul reis in the robes of a king with the sneer of the sphinx on his features and i knew that those features were the features of khephren the great who raised the second pyramid carved over the sphinxs face in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock and i looked at the long lean rigid hand of khephren the long lean rigid hand as i had seen it on the diorite statue in the cairo museumthe statue they had found in the terrible gateway templeand wondered that i had not shrieked when i saw it on abdul reis that hand it was hideously cold and it was crushing me it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus the chill and constriction of unrememberable egypt it was nighted necropolitan egypt itself that yellow paw and they whisper such things of khephren but at this juncture i began to awakeor at least to assume a condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding i recalled the fight atop the pyramid the treacherous bedouins and their attack my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic putrescence i perceived that i now lay on a damp rock floor and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force it was very cold and i seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across me the cuts and bruises i had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft were paining me woefully their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draught and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony as i turned i felt a tug from above and concluded that the rope whereby i was lowered still reached to the surface whether or not the arabs still held it i had no idea nor had i any idea how far within the earth i was i knew that the darkness around me was wholly or nearly total since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold but i did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had characterised my descentknowing at least that i was in a space of considerable extent reached from the surface directly above by an opening in the rock i doubtfully conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old khephrenthe temple of the sphinxperhaps some inner corridor which the guides had not shewn me during my morning visit and from which i might easily escape if i could find my way to the barred entrance it would be a labyrinthine wandering but no worse than others out of which i had in the past found my way the first step was to get free of my bonds gag and blindfold and this i knew would be no great task since subtler experts than these arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an exponent of escape yet had never succeeded in defeating my methodsthen it occurred to me that the arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably held this of course was taking for granted that my place of confinement was indeed khephrens temple of the sphinx the direct opening in the roof wherever it might lurk could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the sphinx if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous i had not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage but knew that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands thinking these matters over as i lay bent and bound on the rock floor i nearly forgot the horrors of the abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so lately reduced me to a coma my present thought was only to outwit the arabs and i accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedomthis however was more easily determined than effected a few preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable motion and it did not surprise me when after one especially energetic struggle i began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me obviously i thought the bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope hastening no doubt to the temples true entrance to lie murderously in wait for me the prospect was not pleasingbut i had faced worse in my time without flinching and would not flinch now at present i must first of all free myself of bonds then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed it is curious how implicitly i had come to believe myself in the old temple of khephren beside the sphinx only a short distance below the groundthat belief was shattered and every pristine apprehension of preternatural depth and daemoniac mystery revived by a circumstance which grew in horror and significance even as i formulated my philosophical plan i have said that the falling rope was piling up about and upon me now i saw that it wascontinuing to pileas no rope of normal length could possibly do it gained in momentum and became an avalanche of hemp accumulating mountainously on the floor and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils soon i was completely engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and stifled me my senses tottered again and i vainly tried to fight off a menace desperate and ineluctable it was not merely that i was tortured beyond human endurancenot merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of meit was the knowledge ofwhat those unnatural lengths of rope impliedand the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me my endless descent and swinging flight through goblin space then must have been real and even now i must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet such a sudden confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable and a second time i lapsed into merciful oblivionwhen i say oblivion i do not imply that i was free from dreams on the contrary my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most unutterable hideousness god if only i had not read so much egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror this second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realisation of the country and its archaic secrets and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in souland bodybeyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves i recalled in dreamshapes which it is well that i do not remember the peculiar and elaborate construction of egyptian sepulchres and the exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this constructionall these people thought of was death and the dead they conceived of a literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse whilst besides the body they believed in two other elements the soul which after its weighing and approval by osiris dwelt in the land of the blest and the obscure and portentouskaor lifeprinciple which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a horrible way demanding occasional access to the preserved body consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel and sometimesas men whisperedtaking its body or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly repellentfor thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring glassily upward when not visited by thekaawaiting the day when osiris should restore bothkaand soul and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep it was to have been a glorious rebirthbut not all souls were approved nor were all tombs inviolate so that certain grotesquemistakesand fiendishabnormalitieswere to be looked for even today the arabs murmur of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether abysses which only winged invisiblekasand soulless mummies may visit and return unscathedperhaps the most leeringly bloodcongealing legends are those which relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraftcomposite mummiesmade by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods at all stages of history the sacred animals were mummified so that consecrated bulls cats ibises crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater glory but only in the decadence did they mix the human and animal in the same mummyonly in the decadence when they did not understand the rights and prerogatives of thekaand the soul what happened to those composite mummies is not told ofat least publiclyand it is certain that no egyptologist ever found one the whispers of arabs are very wild and cannot be relied upon they even hint that old khephrenhe of the sphinx the second pyramid and the yawning gateway templelives far underground wedded to the ghoulqueen nitokris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of beastit was of theseof khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid deadthat i dreamed and that is why i am glad the exact dreamshapes have faded from my memory my most horrible vision was connected with an idle question i had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depths the temple so close to it might be secretly connected that question so innocent and whimsical then assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to representmy second awakeningif awakening it wasis a memory of stark hideousness which nothing else in my lifesave one thing which came aftercan parallel and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most mens remember that i had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position now as perception returned i felt the entire weight gone and realised upon rolling over that although i was still tied gagged and blindfoldedsome agency had removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed methe significance of this condition of course came to me only gradually but even so i think it would have brought unconsciousness again had i not by this time reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference i was alone withwhatbefore i could torture myself with any new reflection or make any fresh effort to escape from my bonds an additional circumstance became manifest pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs and i seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could furnish my chest too seemed pierced by an hundred wounds as though some malign titanic ibis had been pecking at it assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled to desist yet at the time my sensations were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect instead of sinking into a bottomless pit of despair i was stirred to a new courage and action for now i felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on an even basison the strength of this thought i tugged again at my bonds and used all the art of a lifetime to free myself as i had so often done amidst the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds the familiar details of my escaping process commenced to engross me and now that the long rope was gone i half regained my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all and that there had never been any terrible shaft measureless abyss or interminable rope was i after all in the gateway temple of khephren beside the sphinx and had the sneaking arabs stolen in to torture me as i lay helpless there at any rate i must be free let me stand up unbound ungagged and with eyes open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source and i could actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foeshow long i took in shaking off my encumbrances i cannot tell it must have been longer than in my exhibition performances because i was wounded exhausted and enervated by the experiences i had passed through when i was finally free and taking deep breaths of a chill damp evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges i found that i was too cramped and fatigued to move at once there i lay trying to stretch a frame bent and mangled for an indefinite period and straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my positionby degrees my strength and flexibility returned but my eyes beheld nothing as i staggered to my feet i peered diligently in every direction yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that i had known when blindfolded i tried my legs bloodencrusted beneath my shredded trousers and found that i could walk yet could not decide in what direction to go obviously i ought not to walk at random and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance i sought so i paused to note the direction of the cold foetid natronscented aircurrent which i had never ceased to feel accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to the abyss i strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward iti had had a match box with me and even a small electric flashlight but of course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy articles as i walked cautiously in the blackness the draught grew stronger and more offensive till at length i could regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapour pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the fishermans jar in the eastern tale the east egypt truly this dark cradle of civilisation was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels unspeakable the more i reflected on the nature of this cavern wind the greater my sense of disquiet became for although despite its odour i had sought its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world i now saw plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connexion whatsoever with the clean air of the libyan desert but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down i had then been walking in the wrong directionafter a moments reflection i decided not to retrace my steps away from the draught i would have no landmarks for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of distinctive configurations if however i followed up the strange current i would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort from whose gate i could perhaps work round the walls to the opposite side of this cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall that i might fail i well realised i saw that this was no part of khephrens gateway temple which tourists know and it struck me that this particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists and merely stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant arabs who had imprisoned me if so was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer airwhat evidence indeed did i now possess that this was the gateway temple at all for a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me and i thought of that vivid mlange of impressionsdescent suspension in space the rope my wounds and the dreams that were frankly dreams was this the end of life for me or indeed would it be merciful if this momentwerethe end i could answer none of my own questions but merely kept on till fate for a third time reduced me to oblivion this time there were no dreams for the suddenness of the incident shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the offensive draught became strong enough to offer an actual physical resistance i was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelievedthat i ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy human organism often i look back to that night and feel a touch of actualhumourin those repeated lapses of consciousness lapses whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period of course it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred and that all the features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic and dawnflushed face of the great sphinxi prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as i can hence was glad when the police told me that the barrier to khephrens gateway temple had been found unfastened and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part i was glad too when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be expected from my seizure blindfolding lowering struggling with bonds falling some distanceperhaps into a depression in the temples inner gallerydragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it and experiences like that a very soothing diagnosis and yet i know that there must be more than appears on the surface that extreme descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissedand it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my guide abdul reis el drogmanthe tombthroated guide who looked and smiled like king khephreni have digressed from my connected narrativeperhaps in the vain hope of evading the telling of that final incident that incident which of all is most certainly an hallucination but i promised to relate it and do not break promises when i recoveredor seemed to recovermy senses after that fall down the black stone stairs i was quite as alone and in darkness as before the windy stench bad enough before was now fiendish yet i had acquired enough familiarity by this time to bear it stoically dazedly i began to crawl away from the place whence the putrid wind came and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal blocks of a mighty pavement once my head struck against a hard object and when i felt of it i learned that it was the base of a columna column of unbelievable immensitywhose surface was covered with gigantic chiselled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch crawling on i encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances apart when suddenly my attention was captured by the realisation of something which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of itfrom some still lower chasm in earths bowels were proceeding certainsoundsmeasured and definite and like nothing i had ever heard before that they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial i felt almost intuitively and much reading in egyptology led me to associate them with the flute the sambuke the sistrum and the tympanum in their rhythmic piping droning rattling and beating i felt an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of eartha terror peculiarly dissociated from personal fear and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for our planet that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies the sounds increased in volume and i felt that they were approaching thenand may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears againi began to hear faintly and afar offthe morbid and millennial tramping of the marching thingsit was hideous that footfalls sodissimilarshould move in such perfect rhythm the training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of earths inmost monstrosities padding clicking walking stalking rumbling lumbering crawling and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments and then god keep the memory of those arab legends out of my head the mummies without souls the meetingplace of the wanderingkas the hordes of the devilcursed pharaonic dead of forty centuries thecomposite mummiesled through the uttermost onyx voids by king khephren and his ghoulqueen nitokris the tramping drew nearerheaven save me from the sound of those feet and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous wind and i drew behind the enormous circumference of a cyclopic column that i might escape for a while the horror that was stalking millionfooted toward me through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity the flickers increased and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud in the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that i gasped from a sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion bases of columns whose middles were higher than human sight mere bases of things that must each dwarf the eiffel tower to insignificance hieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend iwould notlook at the marching things that i desperately resolved as i heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead tramping it was merciful that they did not speak but godtheir crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columnsheaven take it awayhippopotami should not have human hands and carry torches men should not have the heads of crocodiles i tried to turn away but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were everywhere then i remembered something i used to do in halfconscious nightmares as a boy and began to repeat to myself this is a dream this is a dream but it was of no use and i could only shut my eyes and pray at least that is what i think i did for one is never sure in visionsand i know this can have been nothing more i wondered whether i should ever reach the world again and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if i could discern any feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction the topless columns and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror the sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone and unless this hellish place were wholly without walls i could not fail to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon but i had to shut my eyes again when i realisedhow manyof the things were assemblingand when i glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadilywithout any body above the waista fiendish and ululant corpsegurgle or deathrattle now split the very atmospherethe charnel atmosphere poisonous with naphtha and bitumen blastsin one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies my eyes perversely shaken open gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic fear and physical exhaustion the things had filed ceremonially in one direction the direction of the noisome wind where the light of their torches shewed their bended heads or the bended heads of such as had heads they were worshipping before a great black foetorbelching aperture which reached up almost out of sight and which i could see was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in shadow one of these was indubitably the staircase i had fallen downthe dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columnsan ordinary house would have been lost in it and any average public building could easily have been moved in and out it was so vast a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its boundaries so vast so hideously black and so aromatically stinking directly in front of this yawning polyphemusdoor the things were throwing objectsevidently sacrifices or religious offerings to judge by their gestures khephren was their leader sneering king khephrenor the guide abdul reiscrowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead by his side knelt beautiful queen nitokris whom i saw in profile for a moment noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls and i shut my eyes again when i sawwhatobjects were being thrown as offerings to the foetid aperture or its possible local deityit occurred to me that judging from the elaborateness of this worship the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance was it osiris or isis horus or anubis or some vast unknown god of the dead still more central and supreme there is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an unknown one before ever the known gods were worshipped and now as i steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of those nameless things a thought of escape flashed upon me the hall was dim and the columns heavy with shadow with every creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures it might be barely possible for me to creep past to the faraway end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen trusting to fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches where i was i neither knew nor seriously reflected uponand for a moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which i knew to be a dream was i in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of khephrens gateway templethat temple which generations have persistently called the temple of the sphinx i could not conjecture but i resolved to ascend to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry mewriggling flat on my stomach i began the anxious journey toward the foot of the lefthand staircase which seemed the more accessible of the two i cannot describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl but they may be guessed when one reflects onwhat i had to watch steadily in that malign windblown torchlightin order to avoid detection the bottom of the staircase was as i have said far away in shadow as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted landing above the titanic aperture this placed the last stages of my crawl at some distance from the noisome herd though the spectacle chilled me even when quite remote at my rightat length i succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb keeping close to the wall on which i observed decorations of the most hideous sort and relying for safety on the absorbed ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched the foulbreezed aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before it though the staircase was huge and steep fashioned of vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant the ascent seemed virtually interminable dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of agonising memory i had intended on reaching the landing to climb immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet belowyet a sudden repetition of that thunderous corpsegurgle and deathrattle chorus coming as i had nearly gained the top of the flight and shewing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapetthe monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it it was something quite ponderous even as seen from my height something yellowish and hairy and endowed with a sort of nervous motion it was as large perhaps as a goodsized hippopotamus but very curiously shaped it seemed to have no neck but five separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk the first very small the second goodsized the third and fourth equal and largest of all and the fifth rather small though not so small as the first out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on theexcessively greatquantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture once in a while the thing would leap up and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner its locomotion was so inexplicable that i stared in fascination wishing it would emerge further from the cavernous lair beneath methen itdidemerge itdidemerge and at the sight i turned and fled into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me fled unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or logic guided me and which i must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation it must have been dream or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic dawnflushed face of the great sphinxthe great sphinx godthatidle questioni asked myself on that sunblest morning before what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to representaccursed is the sight be it in dream or not that revealed to me the supreme horrorthe unknown god of the dead which licks its colossal chops in the unsuspected abyss fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not exist the fiveheaded monster that emerged that fiveheaded monster as large as a hippopotamus the

we were sitting on a dilapidated seventeenthcentury tomb in the late afternoon of an autumn day at the old buryingground in arkham and speculating about the unnamable looking toward the giant willow in the centre of the cemetery whose trunk has nearly engulfed an ancient illegible slab i had made a fantastic remark about the spectral and unmentionable nourishment which the colossal roots must be sucking in from that hoary charnel earth when my friend chided me for such nonsense and told me that since no interments had occurred there for over a century nothing could possibly exist to nourish the tree in other than an ordinary manner besides he added my constant talk about unnamable and unmentionable things was a very puerile device quite in keeping with my lowly standing as an author i was too fond of ending my stories with sights or sounds which paralysed my heroes faculties and left them without courage words or associations to tell what they had experienced we know things he said only through our five senses or our religious intuitions wherefore it is quite impossible to refer to any object or spectacle which cannot be clearly depicted by the solid definitions of fact or the correct doctrines of theologypreferably those of the congregationalists with whatever modifications tradition and sir arthur conan doyle may supplywith this friend joel manton i had often languidly disputed he was principal of the east high school born and bred in boston and sharing new englands selfsatisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life it was his view that only our normal objective experiences possess any aesthetic significance and that it is the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action ecstasy and astonishment as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate detailed transcripts of everyday affairs especially did he object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained for although believing in the supernatural much more fully than i he would not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment that a mind can find its greatest pleasure in escapes from the daily treadmill and in original and dramatic recombinations of images usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the hackneyed patterns of actual existence was something virtually incredible to his clear practical and logical intellect with him all things and feelings had fixed dimensions properties causes and effects and although he vaguely knew that the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of far less geometrical classifiable and workable nature he believed himself justified in drawing an arbitrary line and ruling out of court all that cannot be experienced and understood by the average citizen besides he was almost sure that nothing can be really unnamable it didnt sound sensible to himthough i well realised the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sundweller something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness the crumbling slate slabs the patriarchal trees and the centuried gambrel roofs of the witchhaunted old town that stretched around all combined to rouse my spirit in defence of my work and i was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemys own country it was not indeed difficult to begin a counterattack for i knew that joel manton actually half clung to many oldwives superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives to credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers i now insisted argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts it argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world or down the stretch of the centuries how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things or that old graveyards teem with the terrible unbodied intelligence of generations and since spirit in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapesor absences of shapeswhich must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly unnamable common sense in reflecting on these subjects i assured my friend with some warmth is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibilitytwilight had now approached but neither of us felt any wish to cease speaking manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments and eager to refute them having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his success as a teacher whilst i was too sure of my ground to fear defeat the dusk fell and lights faintly gleamed in some of the distant windows but we did not move our seat on the tomb was very comfortable and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient rootdisturbed brickwork close behind us or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering deserted seventeenthcentury house between us and the nearest lighted road there in the dark upon that riven tomb by the deserted house we talked on about the unnamable and after my friend had finished his scoffing i told him of the awful evidence behind the story at which he had scoffed the mostmy tale had been called the attic window and appeared in the january 1922 issue ofwhispersin a good many places especially the south and the pacific coast they took the magazines off the stands at the complaints of silly milksops but new england didnt get the thrill and merely shrugged its shoulders at my extravagance the thing it was averred was biologically impossible to start with merely another of those crazy country mutterings which cotton mather had been gullible enough to dump into his chaoticmagnalia christi americanaand so poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where the horror occurred and as to the way i amplified the bare jotting of the old mysticthat was quite impossible and characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler mather had indeed told of the thing as being born but nobody but a cheap sensationalist would think of having it grow up look into peoples windows at night and be hidden in the attic of a house in flesh and in spirit till someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldnt describe what it was that turned his hair grey all this was flagrant trashiness and my friend manton was not slow to insist on that fact then i told him what i had found in an old diary kept between 1706 and 1723 unearthed among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting that and the certain reality of the scars on my ancestors chest and back which the diary described i told him too of the fears of others in that region and how they were whispered down for generations and how no mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an abandoned house to examine certain traces suspected to be thereit had been an eldritch thingno wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts so little is known of what went on beneath the surfaceso little yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses the witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in mens crushed brains but even that is a trifle there was no beauty no freedomwe can see that from the architectural and household remains and the poisonous sermons of the cramped divines and inside that rusted iron straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness perversion and diabolism here truly was the apotheosis of the unnamablecotton mather in that daemoniac sixth book which no one should read after dark minced no words as he flung forth his anathema stern as a jewish prophet and laconically unamazed as none since his day could be he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than beast but less than manthe thing with the blemished eyeand of the screaming drunken wretch that they hanged for having such an eye this much he baldly told yet without a hint of what came after perhaps he did not know or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell others knew but did not dare to tellthere is no public hint of why they whispered about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a childless broken embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab by an avoided grave although one may trace enough evasive legends to curdle the thinnest bloodit is all in that ancestral diary i found all the hushed innuendoes and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the night or in deserted meadows near the woods something had caught my ancestor on a dark valley road leaving him with marks of horns on his chest and of apelike claws on his back and when they looked for prints in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and vaguely anthropoid paws once a postrider said he saw an old man chasing and calling to a frightful loping nameless thing on meadow hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn and many believed him certainly there was strange talk one night in 1710 when the childless broken old man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of the blank slate slab they never unlocked that attic door but left the whole house as it was dreaded and deserted when noises came from it they whispered and shivered and hoped that the lock on that attic door was strong then they stopped hoping when the horror occurred at the parsonage leaving not a soul alive or in one piece with the years the legends take on a spectral characteri suppose the thing if it was a living thing must have died the memory had lingered hideouslyall the more hideous because it was so secretduring this narration my friend manton had become very silent and i saw that my words had impressed him he did not laugh as i paused but asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793 and who had presumably been the hero of my fiction i told him why the boy had gone to that shunned deserted house and remarked that he ought to be interested since he believed that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them the boy had gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic because of tales of things seen behind them and had come back screaming maniacallymanton remained thoughtful as i said this but gradually reverted to his analytical mood he granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of nature need not beunnamableor scientifically indescribable i admired his clearness and persistence and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people those later spectral legends i made plain related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house the crypt behind it and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death as told in uncorroborated traditions they had produced a strong and consistent impression and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives though largely forgotten by the last two generationsperhaps dying for lack of being thought about moreover so far as aesthetic theory was involved if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the spectre of a malign chaotic perversion itself a morbid blasphemy against nature moulded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely the shriekinglyunnamablethe hour must now have grown very late a singularly noiseless bat brushed by me and i believe it touched manton also for although i could not see him i felt him raise his arm presently he spokebut is that house with the attic window still standing and desertedyes i answered i have seen itand did you find anything therein the attic or anywhere elsethere were some bones up under the eaves they may have been what that boy sawif he was sensitive he wouldnt have needed anything in the windowglass to unhinge him if they all came from the same object it must have been an hysterical delirious monstrosity it would have been blasphemous to leave such bones in the world so i went back with a sack and took them to the tomb behind the house there was an opening where i could dump them in dont think i was a foolyou ought to have seen that skull it had fourinch horns but a face and jaw something like yours and mineat last i could feel a real shiver run through manton who had moved very near but his curiosity was undeterredand what about the windowpanesthey were all gone one window had lost its entire frame and in the other there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond apertures they were that kindthe old lattice windows that went out of use before 1700 i dont believe theyve had any glass for an hundred years or moremaybe the boy broke em if he got that far the legend doesnt saymanton was reflecting againid like to see that house carter where is it glass or no glass i must explore it a little and the tomb where you put those bones and the other grave without an inscriptionthe whole thing must be a bit terribleyou did see ituntil it got darkmy friend was more wrought upon than i had suspected for at this touch of harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and actually cried out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain of previous repression it was an odd cry and all the more terrible because it was answered for as it was still echoing i heard a creaking sound through the pitchy blackness and knew that a lattice window was opening in that accursed old house beside us and because all the other frames were long since fallen i knew that it was the grisly glassless frame of that daemoniac attic windowthen came a noxious rush of noisome frigid air from that same dreaded direction followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster in another instant i was knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen entity of titanic size but undetermined nature knocked sprawling on the rootclutched mould of that abhorrent graveyard while from the tomb came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy peopled the rayless gloom with miltonic legions of the misshapen damned there was a vortex of withering icecold wind and then the rattle of loose bricks and plaster but i had mercifully fainted before i could learn what it meantmanton though smaller than i is more

thursdaynovember 3 1927dear melmoth so you are busy delving into the shady past of that insufferable young asiatic varius avitus bassianus ugh there are few persons i loathe more than that cursed little syrian rati have myself been carried back to roman times by my recent perusal of james rhoadesneida translation never before read by me and more faithful to p maro than any other versified version i have ever seenincluding that of my late uncle dr clark which did not attain publication this virgilian diversion together with the spectral thoughts incident to all hallows eve with its witchsabbaths on the hills produced in me last monday night a roman dream of such supernal clearness and vividness and such titanic adumbrations of hidden horror that i verily believe i shall some day employ it in fiction roman dreams were no uncommon features of my youthi used to follow the divine julius all over gallia as a tribunus militum onightsbut i had so long ceased to experience them that the present one impressed me with extraordinary forceit was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town of pompelo at the foot of the pyrenees in hispania citerior the year must have been in the late republic for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prtorian legate of augustus and the day was the first before the kalends of november the hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to the east groups of citizensbroadbrowed roman colonists and coarsehaired romanised natives together with obvious hybrids of the two strains alike clad in cheap woollen togasand sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarsemantled blackbearded tribesmen of the circumambient vasconesall thronged the few paved streets and forum moved by some vague and illdefined uneasinessi myself had just alighted from a litter which the illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in some haste from calagurris across the iberus to the southward it appeared that i was a provincial qustor named l clius rufus and that i had been summoned by the proconsul p scribonius libo who had come from tarraco some days before the soldiers were the fifth cohort of the xiith legion under the military tribune sex asellius and the legatus of the whole region cn balbutius had also come from calagurris where the permanent station wasthe cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills all the townsfolk were frightened and had begged the presence of a cohort from calagurris it was the terrible season of the autumn and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns they were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the vascones could not understand one seldom saw them but a few times a year they sent down little yellow squinteyed messengers who looked like scythians to trade with the merchants by means of gestures and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks their howlings and altarfires throwing terror into the villages always the samethe night before the kalends of maius and the night before the kalends of november townsfolk would disappear just before these nights and would never be heard of again and there were whispers that the native shepherds and farmers were not illdisposed toward the very old folkthat more than one thatched hut was vacant before midnight on the two hideous sabbathsthis year the horror was very great for the people knew that the wrath of the very old folk was upon pompelo three months previously five of the little squinteyed traders had come down from the hills and in a market brawl three of them had been killed the remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their mountainsand this autumn not a single villager had disappeared there was menace in this immunity it was not like the very old folk to spare their victims at the sabbath it was too good to be normal and the villagers were afraidfor many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills and at last the dile tib annus stilpo half native in blood had sent to balbutius at calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the sabbath on the terrible night balbutius had carelessly refused on the ground that the villagers fears were empty and that the loathsome rites of hill folk were of no concern to the roman people unless our own citizens were menaced i however who seemed to be a close friend of balbutius had disagreed with him averring that i had studied deeply in the black forbidden lore and that i believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost any nameless doom upon the town which after all was a roman settlement and contained a great number of our citizens the complaining diles own mother helvia was a pure roman the daughter of m helvius cinna who had come over with scipios army accordingly i had sent a slavea nimble little greek called antipaterto the proconsul with letters and scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered balbutius to send his fifth cohort under asellius to pompelo entering the hills at dusk on the eve of novembers kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies he might findbringing such prisoners as he might take to tarraco for the next proprtors court balbutius however had protested so that more correspondence had ensued i had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested and had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horrorhe had at length proceeded to pompelo with his lictors and attendants there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed and standing firmly by his order for the sabbaths extirpation desirous of conferring with one who had studied the subject he ordered me to accompany asellius cohortand balbutius had also come along to press his adverse advice for he honestly believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the vascones both tribal and settledso here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hillsold scribonius libo in his toga prtexta the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate blueshaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition young asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer and the curious throng of townsfolk legionaries tribesmen peasants lictors slaves and attendants i myself seemed to wear a common toga and to have no especially distinguishing characteristic and everywhere horror brooded the town and country folk scarcely dared speak aloud and the men of libos entourage who had been there nearly a week seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread old scribonius himself looked very grave and the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic godwe entered the prtorium and held grave converse balbutius pressed his objections and was sustained by asellius who appeared to hold all the natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite them both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction than to antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread ritesi on the other hand renewed my demand for action and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake i pointed out that the barbarous vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions and that it would ill become the representatives of the roman people to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the republic demanded that on the other hand the successful administration of a province depended primarily upon the safety and goodwill of the civilised element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed and in whose veins a large mixture of our own italian blood coursed these though in numbers they might form a minority were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the imperium of the senate and the roman people it was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection due to roman citizens even and here i shot a sarcastic look at balbutius and asellius at the expense of a little trouble and activity and of a slight interruption of the draughtplaying and cockfighting at the camp in calagurris that the danger to the town and inhabitants of pompelo was a real one i could not from my studies doubt i had read many scrolls out of syria and gyptus and the cryptic towns of etruria and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of diana aricina in his temple in the woods bordering lacus nemorensis there were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the sabbaths dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the roman people and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers a postumius being consul had executed so many roman citizens for the practice of the bacchanaliaa matter kept ever in memory by the senatus consultum de bacchanalibus graven upon bronze and set open to every eye checked in time before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a roman pilum might not be able to deal the sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort only participants need be apprehended and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel in short both principle and policy demanded stern action and i could not doubt but that publius scribonius bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman people would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort me accompanying despite such objections as balbutius and aselliusspeaking indeed more like provincials than romansmight see fit to offer and multiplythe slanting sun was now very low and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour then p scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus balbutius and asellius assenting the former with better grace than the latter as twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes a measured hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm some few of the legionarii shewed timidity but sharp commands brought them into line and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus libo himself as well as balbutius insisted on accompanying the cohort but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain finally a young man named vercellius the son of pure roman parents agreed to take us at least past the foothills we began to march in the new dusk with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left that which disquieted us most wasthe fact that the sabbath was to be held at allreports of the coming cohort must have reached the hills and even the lack of a final decision could not make the rumour less alarmingyet there were the sinister drums as of yore as if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the roman people marched against them the sound grew louder as we entered a rising gap in the hills steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on either side and displaying curiously fantastic treetrunks in the light of our bobbing torches all were afoot save libo balbutius asellius two or three of the centuriones and myself and at length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them a squad of ten men being left to guard them though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of terror once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby and after a halfhours climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the advance of so great a body of menover 300 all toldexceedingly cumbrous and difficult then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below it was from the tethered horsesthey hadscreamednot neighed butscreamedand there was no light down there nor the sound of any human thing to shew why they had done so at the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead so that terror seemed to lurk equally well before and behind us looking for the youth vercellius our guide we found only a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood in his hand was a short sword snatched from the belt of d vibulanus a subcenturio and on his face was such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the sight he had killed himself when the horses screamed he who had been born and lived all his life in that region and knew what men whispered about the hills all the torches now began to dim and the cries of frightened legionaries mingled with the unceasing screams of the tethered horses the air grew perceptibly colder more suddenly so than is usual at novembers brink and seemed stirred by terrible undulations which i could not help connecting with the beating of huge wings the whole cohort now remained at a standstill and as the torches faded i watched what i thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by the spectral luminosity of the via lactea as it flowed through perseus cassiopeia cepheus and cygnus then suddenly all the stars were blotted from the skyeven bright deneb and vega ahead and the lone altair and fomalhaut behind us and as the torches died out altogether there remained above the stricken and shrieking cohort only the noxious and horrible altarflames on the towering peaks hellish and red and now silhouetting the mad leaping and colossal forms of such nameless beasts as had never a phrygian priest or campanian grandam whispered of in the wildest of furtive tales and above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dmonic drumming rose to louder pitch whilst an icecold wind of shocking sentience and deliberateness swept down from those forbidden heights and coiled about each man separately till all the cohort was struggling and screaming in the dark as if acting out the fate of laocon and his sons only old scribonius libo seemed resigned he uttered words amidst the screaming and they echo still in my earsmalitia vetusmalitia vetus est venit tandem venit and then i waked it was the most vivid dream in years drawing upon wells of the subconscious long untouched and

i hate the mooni am afraid of itfor when it shines on certain scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideousit was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where i wandered the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild and manycoloured dreams and as i walked by the shallow crystal stream i saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world silent and sparkling bright and baleful those mooncursed waters hurried i knew not whither whilst from the embowered banks white lotos blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate nightwind and dropped despairingly into the stream swirling away horribly under the arched carven bridge and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm dead facesand as i ran along the shore crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces i saw that the garden had no end under that moon for where by day the walls were there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths flowers and shrubs stone idols and pagodas and bendings of the yellowlitten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble and the lips of the dead lotosfaces whispered sadly and bade me follow nor did i cease my steps till the stream became a river and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless seaupon that sea the hateful moon shone and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded and as i saw therein the lotosfaces vanish i longed for nets that i might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night but when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore i saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed and knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come i trembled and did not wish again to speak with the lotosfacesyet when i saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef i would fain have questioned him and asked him of those whom i had known when they were alive this i would have asked him had he not been so far away but he was very far and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reefso i watched the tide go out under that sinking moon and saw gleaming the spires the towers and the roofs of that dead dripping city and as i watched my nostrils tried to close against the perfumeconquering stench of the worlds dead for truly in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy seaworms to gnaw and glut uponover those horrors the evil moon now hung very low but the puffy worms of the sea need no moon to feed by and as i watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath i felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen itnor had my flesh trembled without cause for when i raised my eyes i saw that the waters had ebbed very low shewing much of the vast reef whose rim i had seen before and when i saw that this reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shone in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below i shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moonand to escape this relentless thing i plunged gladly and unhesitatingly into the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat seaworms feast upon the worlds dead,1
ibear in mind closely that i did not see any actual visual horror at the end to say that a mental shock was the cause of what i inferredthat last straw which sent me racing out of the lonely akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of vermont in a commandeered motor at nightis to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience notwithstanding the deep extent to which i shared the information and speculations of henry akeley the things i saw and heard and the admitted vividness of the impression produced on me by these things i cannot prove even now whether i was right or wrong in my hideous inference for after all akeleys disappearance establishes nothing people found nothing amiss in his house despite the bulletmarks on the outside and inside it was just as though he had walked out casually for a ramble in the hills and failed to return there was not even a sign that a guest had been there or that those horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study that he had mortally feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had been born and reared means nothing at all either for thousands are subject to just such morbid fears eccentricity moreover could easily account for his strange acts and apprehensions toward the lastthe whole matter began so far as i am concerned with the historic and unprecedented vermont floods of november 3 1927 i was then as now an instructor of literature at miskatonic university in arkham massachusetts and an enthusiastic amateur student of new england folklore shortly after the flood amidst the varied reports of hardship suffering and organised relief which filled the press there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in some of the swollen rivers so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions and appealed to me to shed what light i could on the subject i felt flattered at having my folklore study taken so seriously and did what i could to belittle the wild vague tales which seemed so clearly an outgrowth of old rustic superstitions it amused me to find several persons of education who insisted that some stratum of obscure distorted fact might underlie the rumoursthe tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings though one yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a letter from his mother in hardwick vermont the type of thing described was essentially the same in all cases though there seemed to be three separate instances involvedone connected with the winooski river near montpelier another attached to the west river in windham county beyond newfane and a third centring in the passumpsic in caledonia county above lyndonville of course many of the stray items mentioned other instances but on analysis they all seemed to boil down to these three in each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre and disturbing objects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills and there was a widespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive halfforgotten cycle of whispered legend which old people resurrected for the occasionwhat people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had ever seen before naturally there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic period but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were not human despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline nor said the witnesses could they have been any kind of animal known to vermont they were pinkish things about five feet long with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated limbs and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid covered with multitudes of very short antennae where a head would ordinarily be it was really remarkable how closely the reports from different sources tended to coincide though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old legends shared at one time throughout the hill country furnished a morbidly vivid picture which might well have coloured the imaginations of all the witnesses concerned it was my conclusion that such witnessesin every case naive and simple backwoods folkhad glimpsed the battered and bloated bodies of human beings or farm animals in the whirling currents and had allowed the halfremembered folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantastic attributesthe ancient folklore while cloudy evasive and largely forgotten by the present generation was of a highly singular character and obviously reflected the influence of still earlier indian tales i knew it well though i had never been in vermont through the exceedingly rare monograph of eli davenport which embraces material orally obtained prior to 1839 among the oldest people of the state this material moreover closely coincided with tales which i had personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of new hampshire briefly summarised it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked somewhere among the remoter hillsin the deep woods of the highest peaks and the dark valleys where streams trickle from unknown sources these beings were seldom glimpsed but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certain deep steepsided gorges that even the wolves shunnedthere were queer footprints or clawprints in the mud of brookmargins and barren patches and curious circles of stones with the grass around them worn away which did not seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by nature there were too certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the hills with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and away from themif indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated and worst of all there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal hillclimbingit would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had not agreed so well as it was nearly all the rumours had several points in common averring that the creatures were a sort of huge lightred crab with many pairs of legs and with two great batlike wings in the middle of the back they sometimes walked on all their legs and sometimes on the hindmost pair only using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature on one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation once a specimen was seen flyinglaunching itself from the top of a bald lonely hill at night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant against the full moonthese things seemed content on the whole to let mankind alone though they were at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individualsespecially persons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains many localities came to be known as inadvisable to settle in the feeling persisting long after the cause was forgotten people would look up at some of the neighbouring mountainprecipices with a shudder even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost and how many farmhouses burnt to ashes on the lower slopes of those grim green sentinelsbut while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world there were tales of the queer clawprints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas tales besides of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cartpaths in the deep woods and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards in the final layer of legendsthe layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded placesthere are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings in one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred thingsas to what the things wereexplanations naturally varied the common name applied to them was those ones or the old ones though other terms had a local and transient use perhaps the bulk of the puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil and made them a basis of awed theological speculation those with celtic legendry in their heritagemainly the scotchirish element of new hampshire and their kindred who had settled in vermont on governor wentworths colonial grantslinked them vaguely with the malign fairies and little people of the bogs and raths and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations but the indians had the most fantastic theories of all while different tribal legends differed there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earththe pennacook myths which were the most consistent and picturesque taught that the winged ones came from the great bear in the sky and had mines in our earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world they did not live here said the myths but merely maintained outposts and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north they harmed only those earthpeople who got too near them or spied upon them animals shunned them through instinctive hatred not because of being hunted they could not eat the things and animals of earth but brought their own food from the stars it was bad to get near them and sometimes young hunters who went into their hills never came back it was not good either to listen to what they whispered at night in the forest with voices like a bees that tried to be like the voices of men they knew the speech of all kinds of menpennacooks hurons men of the five nationsbut did not seem to have or need any speech of their own they talked with their heads which changed colour in different ways to mean different thingsall the legendry of course white and indian alike died down during the nineteenth century except for occasional atavistical flareups the ways of the vermonters became settled and once their habitual paths and dwellings were established according to a certain fixed plan they remembered less and less what fears and avoidances had determined that plan and even that there had been any fears or avoidances most people simply knew that certain hilly regions were considered as highly unhealthy unprofitable and generally unlucky to live in and that the farther one kept from them the better off one usually was in time the ruts of custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in approved places that there was no longer any reason for going outside them and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design save during infrequent local scares only wonderloving grandmothers and retrospective nonagenarians ever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills and even such whisperers admitted that there was not much to fear from those things now that they were used to the presence of houses and settlements and now that human beings let their chosen territory severely aloneall this i had known from my reading and from certain folktales picked up in new hampshire hence when the floodtime rumours began to appear i could easily guess what imaginative background had evolved them i took great pains to explain this to my friends and was correspondingly amused when several contentious souls continued to insist on a possible element of truth in the reports such persons tried to point out that the early legends had a significant persistence and uniformity and that the virtually unexplored nature of the vermont hills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not dwell among them nor could they be silenced by my assurance that all the myths were of a wellknown pattern common to most of mankind and determined by early phases of imaginative experience which always produced the same type of delusionit was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the vermont myths differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs suggested thekallikanzariof modern greece and gave to wild wales and ireland their dark hints of strange small and terrible hidden races of troglodytes and burrowers no use either to point out the even more startlingly similar belief of the nepalese hill tribes in the dreadedmigoor abominable snowmen who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the himalayan summits when i brought up this evidence my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder earthrace driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind which might very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent timesor even to the presentthe more i laughed at such theories the more these stubborn friends asseverated them adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were too clear consistent detailed and sanely prosaic in manner of telling to be completely ignored two or three fanatical extremists went so far as to hint at possible meanings in the ancient indian tales which gave the hidden beings a nonterrestrial origin citing the extravagant books of charles fort with their claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited earth most of my foes however were merely romanticists who insisted on trying to transfer to real life the fantastic lore of lurking little people made popular by the magnificent horrorfiction of arthur macheniias was only natural under the circumstances this piquant debating finally got into print in the form of letters to thearkham advertisersome of which were copied in the press of those vermont regions whence the floodstories came therutland heraldgave half a page of extracts from the letters on both sides while thebrattleboro reformerreprinted one of my long historical and mythological summaries in full with some accompanying comments in the pendrifters thoughtful column which supported and applauded my sceptical conclusions by the spring of 1928 i was almost a wellknown figure in vermont notwithstanding the fact that i had never set foot in the state then came the challenging letters from henry akeley which impressed me so profoundly and which took me for the first and last time to that fascinating realm of crowded green precipices and muttering forest streamsmost of what i now know of henry wentworth akeley was gathered by correspondence with his neighbours and with his only son in california after my experience in his lonely farmhouse he was i discovered the last representative on his home soil of a long locally distinguished line of jurists administrators and gentlemenagriculturists in him however the family mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship so that he had been a notable student of mathematics astronomy biology anthropology and folklore at the university of vermont i had never previously heard of him and he did not give many autobiographical details in his communications but from the first i saw he was a man of character education and intelligence albeit a recluse with very little worldly sophisticationdespite the incredible nature of what he claimed i could not help at once taking akeley more seriously than i had taken any of the other challengers of my views for one thing he was really close to the actual phenomenavisible and tangiblethat he speculated so grotesquely about and for another thing he was amazingly willing to leave his conclusions in a tentative state like a true man of science he had no personal preferences to advance and was always guided by what he took to be solid evidence of course i began by considering him mistaken but gave him credit for being intelligently mistaken and at no time did i emulate some of his friends in attributing his ideas and his fear of the lonely green hills to insanity i could see that there was a great deal to the man and knew that what he reported must surely come from strange circumstances deserving investigation however little it might have to do with the fantastic causes he assigned later on i received from him certain material proofs which placed the matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basisi cannot do better than transcribe in full so far as is possible the long letter in which akeley introduced himself and which formed such an important landmark in my own intellectual history it is no longer in my possession but my memory holds almost every word of its portentous message and again i affirm my confidence in the sanity of the man who wrote it here is the texta text which reached me in the cramped archaiclooking scrawl of one who had obviously not mingled much

reformersreprint apr 23 28 of your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded streams last fall and on the curious folklore they so well agree with it is easy to see why an outlander would take the position you take and even why pendrifter agrees with you that is the attitude generally taken by educated persons both in and out of vermont and was my own attitude as a young man i am now 57 before my studies both general and in davenports book led me to do some exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visitedi was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales i used to hear from elderly farmers of the more ignorant sort but now i wish i had let the whole matter alone i might say with all proper modesty that the subject of anthropology and folklore is by no means strange to me i took a good deal of it at college and am familiar with most of the standard authorities such as tylor lubbock frazer quatrefages murray osborn keith boule g elliot smith and so on it is no news to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind i have seen the reprints of letters from you and those arguing with you in therutland heraldand guess i know about where your controversy stands at the present timewhat i desire to say now is that i am afraid your adversaries are nearer right than yourself even though all reason seems to be on your side they are nearer right than they realise themselvesfor of course they go only by theory and cannot know what i know if i knew as little of the matter as they i would not feel justified in believing as they do i would be wholly on your sideyou can see that i am having a hard time getting to the point probably because i really dread getting to the point but the upshot of the matter is thati have certain evidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high hills which nobody visitsi have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers as reportedbut i have seen things like themunder circumstances i dread to repeat i have seen footprints and of late have seen them nearer my own home i live in the old akeley place south of townshend village on the side of dark mountain than i dare tell you now and i have overheard voices in the woods at certain points that i will not even begin to describe on paperat one place i heard them so much that i took a phonograph therewith a dictaphone attachment and wax blankand i shall try to arrange to have you hear the record i got i have run it on the machine for some of the old people up here and one of the voices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its likeness to a certain voice that buzzing voice in the woods which davenport mentions that their grandmothers have told about and mimicked for them i know what most people think of a man who tells about hearing voicesbut before you draw conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older backwoods people what they think of it if you can account for it normally very well but there must be something behind itex nihilo nihil fityou knownow my object in writing you is not to start an argument but to give you information which i think a man of your tastes will find deeply interestingthis is private publicly i am on your sidefor certain things shew me that it does not do for people to know too much about these matters my own studies are now wholly private and i would not think of saying anything to attract peoples attention and cause them to visit the places i have explored it is trueterribly truethat there arenonhuman creatures watching us all the timewith spies among us gathering information it is from a wretched man who if he was sane as i think he waswas one of those spiesthat i got a large part of my clues to the matter he later killed himself but i have reason to think there are others nowthe things come from another planet being able to live in interstellar space and fly through iton clumsy powerful wings which have a way of resisting the ether but which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them about on earth i will tell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as a madman they come here to get metals from mines that go deep under the hillsand i think i know where they come fromthey will not hurt us if we let them alone but no one can say what will happen if we get too curious about them of course a good army of men could wipe out their mining colony that is what they are afraid of but if that happened more would come fromoutsideany number of them they could easily conquer the earth but have not tried so far because they have not needed to they would rather leave things as they are to save botheri think they mean to get rid of me because of what i have discovered there is a great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which i found in the woods on round hill east of here and after i took it home everything became different if they think i suspect too much they will either kill meor take me off the earth to where they come fromthey like to take away men of learning once in a while to keep informed on the state of things in the human worldthis leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing younamely to urge you to hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicitypeople must be kept away from these hillsand in order to effect this their curiosity ought not to be aroused any further heaven knows there is peril enough anyway with promoters and real estate men flooding vermont with herds of summer people to overrun the wild places and cover the hills with cheap bungalowsi shall welcome further communication with you and shall try to send you that phonograph record and black stone which is so worn that photographs dont shew much by express if you are willing i say try because i think those creatures have a way of tampering with things around here there is a sullen furtive fellow named brown on a farm near the village who i think is their spy little by little they are trying to cut me off from our world because i know too much about their worldthey have the most amazing way of finding out what i do you may not even get this letter i think i shall have to leave this part of the country and go to live with my son in san diego cal if things get any worse but it is not easy to give up the place you were born in and where your family has lived for six generations also i would hardly dare sell this house to anybody now that thecreatureshave taken notice of it they seem to be trying to get the black stone back and destroy the phonograph record but i shall not let them if i can help it my great police dogs always hold them back for there are very few here as yet and they are clumsy in getting about as i have said their wings are not much use for short flights on earth i am on the very brink of deciphering that stonein a very terrible wayand with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply missing links enough to help me i suppose you know all about the fearful myths antedating the coming of man to the earththe yogsothoth and cthulhu cycleswhich are hinted at in thenecronomiconi had access to a copy of that once and hear that you have one in your college library under lock and keyto conclude mr wilmarth i think that with our respective studies we can be very useful to each other i dont wish to put you in any peril and suppose i ought to warn you that possession of the stone and the record wont be very safe but i think you will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge i will drive down to newfane or brattleboro to send whatever you authorise me to send for the express offices there are more to be trusted i might say that i live quite alone now since i cant keep hired help any more they wont stay because of the things that try to get near the house at night and that keep the dogs barking continually i am glad i didnt get as deep as this into the business while my wife was alive for it would have driven her madhoping that i am not bothering you unduly and that you will decide to get in touch with me rather than throw this letter into the waste basket as a madmans raving i amyrs very trulyhenry w akeleyps i am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me which i think will help to prove a number of the points i have touched on the old people think they are monstrously true i shall send you these very soon if you are interested hwait would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange document for the first time by all ordinary rules i ought to have laughed more loudly at these extravagances than at the far milder theories which had previously moved me to mirth yet something in the tone of the letter made me take it with paradoxical seriousness not that i believed for a moment in the hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of but that after some grave preliminary doubts i grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity and of his confrontation by some genuine though singular and abnormal phenomenon which he could not explain except in this imaginative way it could not be as he thought it i reflected yet on the other hand it could not be otherwise than worthy of investigation the man seemed unduly excited and alarmed about something but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking he was so specific and logical in certain waysand after all his yarn did fit in so perplexingly well with some of the old mythseven the wildest indian legendsthat he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills and had really found the black stone he spoke about was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he had madeinferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outer beings and had later killed himself it was easy to deduce that this man must have been wholly insane but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive akeleyalready prepared for such things by his folklore studiesbelieve his tale as for the latest developmentsit appeared from his inability to keep hired help that akeleys humbler rustic neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at night the dogs really barked tooand then the matter of that phonograph record which i could not but believe he had obtained in the way he said it must mean something whether animal noises deceptively like human speech or the speech of some hidden nighthaunting human being decayed to a state not much above that of lower animals from this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed stone and to speculations upon what it might mean then too what of the photographs which akeley said he was about to send and which the old people had found so convincingly terribleas i reread the cramped handwriting i felt as never before that my credulous opponents might have more on their side than i had conceded after all there might be some queer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills even though no such race of starborn monsters as folklore claimed and if there were then the presence of strange bodies in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief was it too presumptuous to suppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind them but even as i harboured these doubts i felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of bizarrerie as henry akeleys wild letter had brought them upin the end i answered akeleys letter adopting a tone of friendly interest and soliciting further particulars his reply came almost by return mail and contained true to promise a number of kodak views of scenes and objects illustrating what he had to tell glancing at these pictures as i took them from the envelope i felt a curious sense of fright and nearness to forbidden things for in spite of the vagueness of most of them they had a damnably suggestive power which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographsactual optical links with what they portrayed and the product of an impersonal transmitting process without prejudice fallibility or mendacitythe more i looked at them the more i saw that my serious estimate of akeley and his story had not been unjustified certainly these pictures carried conclusive evidence of something in the vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our common knowledge and belief the worst thing of all was the footprinta view taken where the sun shone on a mud patch somewhere in a deserted upland this was no cheaply counterfeited thing i could see at a glance for the sharply defined pebbles and grassblades in the field of vision gave a clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure i have called the thing a footprint but clawprint would be a better term even now i can scarcely describe it save to say that it was hideously crablike and that there seemed to be some ambiguity about its direction it was not a very deep or fresh print but seemed to be about the size of an average mans foot from a central pad pairs of sawtoothed nippers projected in opposite directionsquite baffling as to function if indeed the whole object were exclusively an organ of locomotionanother photographevidently a timeexposure taken in deep shadowwas of the mouth of a woodland cave with a boulder of rounded regularity choking the aperture on the bare ground in front of it one could just discern a dense network of curious tracks and when i studied the picture with a magnifier i felt uneasily sure that the tracks were like the one in the other view a third picture shewed a druidlike circle of standing stones on the summit of a wild hill around the cryptic circle the grass was very much beaten down and worn away though i could not detect any footprints even with the glass the extreme remoteness of the place was apparent from the veritable sea of tenantless mountains which formed the background and stretched away toward a misty horizonbut if the most disturbing of all the views was that of the footprint the most curiously suggestive was that of the great black stone found in the round hill woods akeley had photographed it on what was evidently his study table for i could see rows of books and a bust of milton in the background the thing as nearly as one might guess had faced the camera vertically with a somewhat irregularly curved surface of one by two feet but to say anything definite about that surface or about the general shape of the whole mass almost defies the power of language what outlandish geometrical principles had guided its cuttingfor artificially cut it surely wasi could not even begin to guess and never before had i seen anything which struck me as so strangely and unmistakably alien to this world of the hieroglyphics on the surface i could discern very few but one or two that i did see gave me rather a shock of course they might be fraudulent for others besides myself had read the monstrous and abhorrednecronomiconof the mad arab abdul alhazred but it nevertheless made me shiver to recognise certain ideographs which study had taught me to link with the most bloodcurdling and blasphemous whispers of things that had had a kind of mad halfexistence before the earth and the other inner worlds of the solar system were madeof the five remaining pictures three were of swamp and hill scenes which seemed to bear traces of hidden and unwholesome tenancy another was of a queer mark in the ground very near akeleys house which he said he had photographed the morning after a night on which the dogs had barked more violently than usual it was very blurred and one could really draw no certain conclusions from it but it did seem fiendishly like that other mark or clawprint photographed on the deserted upland the final picture was of the akeley place itself a trim white house of two stories and attic about a century and a quarter old and with a wellkept lawn and stonebordered path leading up to a tastefully carved georgian doorway there were several huge police dogs on the lawn squatting near a pleasantfaced man with a closecropped grey beard whom i took to be akeley himselfhis own photographer one might infer from the tubeconnected bulb in his right handfrom the pictures i turned to the bulky closely written letter itself and for the next three hours was immersed in a gulf of unutterable horror where akeley had given only outlines before he now entered into minute details presenting long transcripts of words overheard in the woods at night long accounts of monstrous pinkish forms spied in thickets at twilight on the hills and a terrible cosmic narrative derived from the application of profound and varied scholarship to the endless bygone discourses of the mad selfstyled spy who had killed himself i found myself faced by names and terms that i had heard elsewhere in the most hideous of connexionsyuggoth great cthulhu tsathoggua yogsothoth rlyeh nyarlathotep azathoth hastur yian leng the lake of hali bethmoora the yellow sign lmurkathulos bran and the magnum innominandumand was drawn back through nameless aeons and inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder outer entity at which the crazed author of thenecronomiconhad only guessed in the vaguest way i was told of the pits of primal life and of the streams that had trickled down therefrom and finally of the tiny rivulet from one of those streams which had become entangled with the destinies of our own earthmy brain whirled and where before i had attempted to explain things away i now began to believe in the most abnormal and incredible wonders the array of vital evidence was damnably vast and overwhelming and the cool scientific attitude of akeleyan attitude removed as far as imaginable from the demented the fanatical the hysterical or even the extravagantly speculativehad a tremendous effect on my thought and judgment by the time i laid the frightful letter aside i could understand the fears he had come to entertain and was ready to do anything in my power to keep people away from those wild haunted hills even now when time has dulled the impression and made me half question my own experience and horrible doubts there are things in that letter of akeleys which i would not quote or even form into words on paper i am almost glad that the letter and record and photographs are gone nowand i wish for reasons i shall soon make clear that the new planet beyond neptune had not been discoveredwith the reading of that letter my public debating about the vermont horror permanently ended arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put off with promises and eventually the controversy petered out into oblivion during late may and june i was in constant correspondence with akeley though once in a while a letter would be lost so that we would have to retrace our ground and perform considerable laborious copying what we were trying to do as a whole was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological scholarship and arrive at a clearer correlation of the vermont horrors with the general body of primitive world legendfor one thing we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellish himalayanmigowere one and the same order of incarnated nightmare there were also absorbing zological conjectures which i would have referred to professor dexter in my own college but for akeleys imperative command to tell no one of the matter before us if i seem to disobey that command now it is only because i think that at this stage a warning about those farther vermont hillsand about those himalayan peaks which bold explorers are more and more determined to ascendis more conducive to public safety than silence would be one specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics on that infamous black stonea deciphering which might well place us in possession of secrets deeper and more dizzying than any formerly known to maniiitoward the end of june the phonograph record cameshipped from brattleboro since akeley was unwilling to trust conditions on the branch line north of there he had begun to feel an increased sense of espionage aggravated by the loss of some of our letters and said much about the insidious deeds of certain men whom he considered tools and agents of the hidden beings most of all he suspected the surly farmer walter brown who lived alone on a rundown hillside place near the deep woods and who was often seen loafing around corners in brattleboro bellows falls newfane and south londonderry in the most inexplicable and seemingly unmotivated way browns voice he felt convinced was one of those he had overheard on a certain occasion in a very terrible conversation and he had once found a footprint or clawprint near browns house which might possess the most ominous significance it had been curiously near some of browns own footprintsfootprints that faced toward itso the record was shipped from brattleboro whither akeley drove in his ford car along the lonely vermont back roads he confessed in an accompanying note that he was beginning to be afraid of those roads and that he would not even go into townshend for supplies now except in broad daylight it did not pay he repeated again and again to know too much unless one were very remote from those silent and problematical hills he would be going to california pretty soon to live with his son though it was hard to leave a place where all ones memories and ancestral feelings centredbefore trying the record on the commercial machine which i borrowed from the college administration building i carefully went over all the explanatory matter in akeleys various letters this record he had said was obtained about 1 am on the first of may 1915 near the closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west slope of dark mountain rises out of lees swamp the place had always been unusually plagued with strange voices this being the reason he had brought the phonograph dictaphone and blank in expectation of results former experience had told him that mayevethe hideous sabbatnight of underground european legendwould probably be more fruitful than any other date and he was not disappointed it was noteworthy though that he never again heard voices at that particular spotunlike most of the overheard forest voices the substance of the record was quasiritualistic and included one palpably human voice which akeley had never been able to place it was not browns but seemed to be that of a man of greater cultivation the second voice however was the real crux of the thingfor this was the accursedbuzzingwhich had no likeness to humanity despite the human words which it uttered in good english grammar and a scholarly accentthe recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well and had of course been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled nature of the overheard ritual so that the actual speech secured was very fragmentary akeley had given me a transcript of what he believed the spoken words to be and i glanced through this again as i prepared the machine for action the text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible though a knowledge of its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror which any words could well possess i will present it here in full as i remember itand i am fairly confident that i know it correctly by heart not only from reading the transcript but from playing the record itself over and over again it is not a thing which one might readily forgetindistinguishable soundsa cultivated male human voice is the lord of the woods even to and the

words for which i was to listen when i started the phonograph it was with a trace of genuine dread and reluctance that i pressed the lever and heard the preliminary scratching of the sapphire point and i was glad that the first faint fragmentary words were in a human voicea mellow educated voice which seemed vaguely bostonian in accent and which was certainly not that of any native of the vermont hills as i listened to the tantalisingly feeble rendering i seemed to find the speech identical with akeleys carefully prepared transcript on it chanted in that mellow bostonian voice i shubniggurath the goat with a thousand young and then i heardthe other voiceto this hour i shudder retrospectively when i think of how it struck me prepared though i was by akeleys accounts those to whom i have since described the record profess to find nothing but cheap imposture or madness in it butcould they have heard the accursed thing itselfor read the bulk of akeleys correspondence especially that terrible and encyclopaedic second letter i know they would think differently it is after all a tremendous pity that i did not disobey akeley and play the record for othersa tremendous pity too that all of his letters were lost to me with my firsthand impression of the actual sounds and with my knowledge of the background and surrounding circumstances the voice was a monstrous thing it swiftly followed the human voice in ritualistic response but in my imagination it was a morbid echo winging its way across unimaginable abysses from unimaginable outer hells it is more than two years now since i last ran off that blasphemous waxen cylinder but at this moment and at all other moments i can still hear that feeble fiendish buzzing as it reached me for the first timei shubniggurath the black goat of the woods with a thousand youngbut though that voice is always in my ears i have not even yet been able to analyse it well enough for a graphic description it was like the drone of some loathsome gigantic insect ponderously shaped into the articulate speech of an alien species and i am perfectly certain that the organs producing it can have no resemblance to the vocal organs of man or indeed to those of any of the mammalia there were singularities in timbre range and overtones which placed this phenomenon wholly outside the sphere of humanity and earthlife its sudden advent that first time almost stunned me and i heard the rest of the record through in a sort of abstracted daze when the longer passage of buzzing came there was a sharp intensification of that feeling of blasphemous infinity which had struck me during the shorter and earlier passage at last the record ended abruptly during an unusually clear speech of the human and bostonian voice but i sat stupidly staring long after the machine had automatically stoppedi hardly need say that i gave that shocking record many another playing and that i made exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes with akeley it would be both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we concluded but i may hint that we agreed in believing we had secured a clue to the source of some of the most repulsive primordial customs in the cryptic elder religions of mankind it seemed plain to us also that there were ancient and elaborate alliances between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of the human race how extensive these alliances were and how their state today might compare with their state in earlier ages we had no means of guessing yet at best there was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation there seemed to be an awful immemorial linkage in several definite stages betwixt man and nameless infinity the blasphemies which appeared on earth it was hinted came from the dark planet yuggoth at the rim of the solar system but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose ultimate source must lie far outside even the einsteinian spacetime continuum or greatest known cosmosmeanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of getting it to arkhamakeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of his nightmare studies for some reason or other akeley was afraid to trust the thing to any ordinary or expected transportation route his final idea was to take it across county to bellows falls and ship it on the boston and maine system through keene and winchendon and fitchburg even though this would necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more foresttraversing hill roads than the main highway to brattleboro he said he had noticed a man around the express office at brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph record whose actions and expression had been far from reassuring this man had seemed too anxious to talk with the clerks and had taken the train on which the record was shipped akeley confessed that he had not felt strictly at ease about that record until he heard from me of its safe receiptabout this timethe second week in julyanother letter of mine went astray as i learned through an anxious communication from akeley after that he told me to address him no more at townshend but to send all mail in care of the general delivery at brattleboro whither he would make frequent trips either in his car or on the motorcoach line which had lately replaced passenger service on the lagging branch railway i could see that he was getting more and more anxious for he went into much detail about the increased barking of the dogs on moonless nights and about the fresh clawprints he sometimes found in the road and in the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came once he told about a veritable army of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and resolute line of dogtracks and sent a loathsomely disturbing kodak picture to prove it that was after a night on which the dogs had outdone themselves in barking and howlingon the morning of wednesday july 18 i received a telegram from bellows falls in which akeley said he was expressing the black stone over the b m on train no 5508 leaving bellows falls at 1215 pm standard time and due at the north station in boston at 412 pm it ought i calculated to get up to arkham at least by the next noon and accordingly i stayed in all thursday morning to receive it but noon came and went without its advent and when i telephoned down to the express office i was informed that no shipment for me had arrived my next act performed amidst a growing alarm was to give a longdistance call to the express agent at the boston north station and i was scarcely surprised to learn that my consignment had not appeared train no 5508 had pulled in only 35 minutes late on the day before but had contained no box addressed to me the agent promised however to institute a searching inquiry and i ended the day by sending akeley a nightletter outlining the situationwith commendable promptness a report came from the boston office on the following afternoon the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts it seemed that the railway express clerk on no 5508 had been able to recall an incident which might have much bearing on my lossan argument with a very curiousvoiced man lean sandy and rusticlooking when the train was waiting at keene nh shortly after one oclock standard timethe man he said was greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed to expect but which was neither on the train nor entered on the companys books he had given the name of stanley adams and had had such a queerly thick droning voice that it made the clerk abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him the clerk could not remember quite how the conversation had ended but recalled starting into a fuller awakeness when the train began to move the boston agent added that this clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned veracity and reliability of known antecedents and long with the companythat evening i went to boston to interview the clerk in person having obtained his name and address from the office he was a frank prepossessing fellow but i saw that he could add nothing to his original account oddly he was scarcely sure that he could even recognise the strange inquirer again realising that he had no more to tell i returned to arkham and sat up till morning writing letters to akeley to the express company and to the police department and station agent in keene i felt that the strangevoiced man who had so queerly affected the clerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business and hoped that keene station employees and telegraphoffice records might tell something about him and about how he happened to make his inquiry when and where he didi must admit however that all my investigations came to nothing the queervoiced man had indeed been noticed around the keene station in the early afternoon of july 18 and one lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a heavy box but he was altogether unknown and had not been seen before or since he had not visited the telegraph office or received any message so far as could be learned nor had any message which might justly be considered a notice of the black stones presence on no 5508 come through the office for anyone naturally akeley joined with me in conducting these inquiries and even made a personal trip to keene to question the people around the station but his attitude toward the matter was more fatalistic than mine he seemed to find the loss of the box a portentous and menacing fulfilment of inevitable tendencies and had no real hope at all of its recovery he spoke of the undoubted telepathic and hypnotic powers of the hill creatures and their agents and in one letter hinted that he did not believe the stone was on this earth any longer for my part i was duly enraged for i had felt there was at least a chance of learning profound and astonishing things from the old blurred hieroglyphs the matter would have rankled bitterly in my mind had not akeleys immediate subsequent letters brought up a new phase of the whole horrible hill problem which at once seized all my attentionivthe unknown things akeley wrote in a script grown pitifully tremulous had begun to close in on him with a wholly new degree of determination the nocturnal barking of the dogs whenever the moon was dim or absent was hideous now and there had been attempts to molest him on the lonely roads he had to traverse by day on the second of august while bound for the village in his car he had found a treetrunk laid in his path at a point where the highway ran through a deep patch of woods while the savage barking of the two great dogs he had with him told all too well of the things which must have been lurking near what would have happened had the dogs not been there he did not dare guessbut he never went out now without at least two of his faithful and powerful pack other road experiences had occurred on august 5th and 6th a shot grazing his car on one occasion and the barking of the dogs telling of unholy woodland presences on the otheron august 15th i received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly and which made me wish akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the aid of the law there had been frightful happenings on the night of the 1213th bullets flying outside the farmhouse and three of the twelve great dogs being found shot dead in the morning there were myriads of clawprints in the road with the human prints of walter brown among them akeley had started to telephone to brattleboro for more dogs but the wire had gone dead before he had a chance to say much later he went to brattleboro in his car and learned there that linemen had found the main telephone cable neatly cut at a point where it ran through the deserted hills north of newfane but he was about to start home with four fine new dogs and several cases of ammunition for his biggame repeating rifle the letter was written at the post office in brattleboro and came through to me without delaymy attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly slipping from a scientific to an alarmedly personal one i was afraid for akeley in his remote lonely farmhouse and half afraid for myself because of my now definite connexion with the strange hill problem the thing wasreaching outso would it suck me in and engulf me in replying to his letter i urged him to seek help and hinted that i might take action myself if he did not i spoke of visiting vermont in person in spite of his wishes and of helping him explain the situation to the proper authorities in return however i received only a telegram from bellows falls which read thusappreciate your position but can do nothing take no action yourself for it could only harm both wait for explanationhenry akelybut the affair was steadily deepening upon my replying to the telegram i received a shaky note from akeley with the astonishing news that he had not only never sent the wire but had not received the letter from me to which it was an obvious reply hasty inquiries by him at bellows falls had brought out that the message was deposited by a strange sandyhaired man with a curiously thick droning voice though more than this he could not learn the clerk shewed him the original text as scrawled in pencil by the sender but the handwriting was wholly unfamiliar it was noticeable that the signature was misspelledakely without the second e certain conjectures were inevitable but amidst the obvious crisis he did not stop to elaborate upon themhe spoke of the death of more dogs and the purchase of still others and of the exchange of gunfire which had become a settled feature each moonless night browns prints and the prints of at least one or two more shod human figures were now found regularly among the clawprints in the road and at the back of the farmyard it was akeley admitted a pretty bad business and before long he would probably have to go to live with his california son whether or not he could sell the old place but it was not easy to leave the only spot one could really think of as home he must try to hang on a little longer perhaps he could scare off the intrudersespecially if he openly gave up all further attempts to penetrate their secretswriting akeley at once i renewed my offers of aid and spoke again of visiting him and helping him convince the authorities of his dire peril in his reply he seemed less set against that plan than his past attitude would have led one to predict but said he would like to hold off a little while longerlong enough to get his things in order and reconcile himself to the idea of leaving an almost morbidly cherished birthplace people looked askance at his studies and speculations and it would be better to get quietly off without setting the countryside in a turmoil and creating widespread doubts of his own sanity he had had enough he admitted but he wanted to make a dignified exit if he couldthis letter reached me on the twentyeighth of august and i prepared and mailed as encouraging a reply as i could apparently the encouragement had effect for akeley had fewer terrors to report when he acknowledged my note he was not very optimistic though and expressed the belief that it was only the full moon season which was holding the creatures off he hoped there would not be many densely cloudy nights and talked vaguely of boarding in brattleboro when the moon waned again i wrote him encouragingly but on september 5th there came a fresh communication which had obviously crossed my letter in the mails and to this i could not give any such hopeful response in view of its importance i believe i had better give it in fullas best i can do from memory of the shaky script it ran substantially as followsmondaydear wilmartha rather discouraging ps to my last last night was thickly cloudythough no rainand not a bit of moonlight got through things were pretty bad and i think the end is getting near in spite of all we have hoped after midnight something landed on the roof of the house and the dogs all rushed up to see what it was i could hear them snapping and tearing around and then one managed to get on the roof by jumping from the low ell there was a terrible fight up there and i heard a frightfulbuzzingwhich ill never forget and then there was a shocking smell about the same time bullets came through the window and nearly grazed me i think the main line of the hill creatures had got close to the house when the dogs divided because of the roof business what was up there i dont know yet but im afraid the creatures are learning to steer better with their space wings i put out the light and used the windows for loopholes and raked all around the house with rifle fire aimed just high enough not to hit the dogs that seemed to end the business but in the morning i found great pools of blood in the yard beside pools of a green sticky stuff that had the worst odour i have ever smelled i climbed up on the roof and found more of the sticky stuff there five of the dogs were killedim afraid i hit one by aiming too low for he was shot in the back now i am setting the panes the shots broke and am going to brattleboro for more dogs i guess the men at the kennels think i am crazy will drop another note later suppose ill be ready for moving in a week or two though it nearly kills me to think of ithastilyakeleybut this was not the only letter from akeley to cross mine on the next morningseptember 6thstill another came this time a frantic scrawl which utterly unnerved me and put me at a loss what to say or do next again i cannot do better than quote the text as faithfully as memory will let metuesdayclouds didnt break so no moon againand going into the wane anyhow id have the house wired for electricity and put in a searchlight if i didnt know theyd cut the cables as fast as they could be mendedi think i am going crazy it may be that all i have ever written you is a dream or madness it was bad enough before but this time it is too muchthey talked to me last nighttalked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me thingsthat i dare not repeat to youi heard them plainly over the barking of the dogs and once when they were drowned outa human voice helped themkeep out of this wilmarthit is worse than either you or i ever suspectedthey dont mean to let me get to california nowthey want to take me off alive or what theoretically and mentally amounts to alivenot only to yuggoth but beyond thataway outside the galaxyand possibly beyond the last curved rim of spacei told them i wouldnt go where they wishor in the terrible way they propose to take mebut im afraid it will be no use my place is so far out that they may come by day as well as by night before long six more dogs killed and i felt presences all along the wooded parts of the road when i drove to brattleboro todayit was a mistake for me to try to send you that phonograph record and black stone better smash the record before its too late will drop you another line tomorrow if im still here wish i could arrange to get my books and things to brattleboro and board there i would run off without anything if i could but something inside my mind holds me back i can slip out to brattleboro where i ought to be safe but i feel just as much a prisoner there as at the house and i seem to know that i couldnt get much farther even if i dropped everything and tried it is horribledont get mixed up in thisyrsakeleyi did not sleep at all the night after receiving this terrible thing and was utterly baffled as to akeleys remaining degree of sanity the substance of the note was wholly insane yet the manner of expressionin view of all that had gone beforehad a grimly potent quality of convincingness i made no attempt to answer it thinking it better to wait until akeley might have time to reply to my latest communication such a reply indeed came on the following day though the fresh material in it quite overshadowed any of the points brought up by the letter it nominally answered here is what i recall of the text scrawled and blotted as it was in the course of a plainly frantic and hurried compositionwednesdaywyr letter came but its no use to discuss anything any more i am fully resigned wonder that i have even enough will power left to fight them off cant escape even if i were willing to give up everything and run theyll get mehad a letter from them yesterdayrfd man brought it while i was at brattleboro typed and postmarked bellows falls tells what they want to do with mei cant repeat it look out for yourself too smash that record cloudy nights keep up and moon waning all the time wish i dared to get helpit might brace up my will powerbut everyone who would dare to come at all would call me crazy unless there happened to be some proof couldnt ask people to come for no reason at allam all out of touch with everybody and have been for yearsbut i havent told you the worst wilmarth brace up to read this for it will give you a shock i am telling the truth though it is thisi have seen and touched one of the things or part of one of the thingsgod man but its awful it was dead of course one of the dogs had it and i found it near the kennel this morning i tried to save it in the woodshed to convince people of the whole thing but it all evaporated in a few hours nothing left you know all those things in the rivers were seen only on the first morning after the flood and heres the worst i tried to photograph it for you but when i developed the filmthere wasnt anything visible except the woodshedwhat can the thing have been made of i saw it and felt it and they all leave footprints it was surely made of matterbut what kind of matter the shape cant be described it was a great crab with a lot of pyramided fleshy rings or knots of thick ropy stuff covered with feelers where a mans head would be that green sticky stuff is its blood or juice and there are more of them due on earth any minutewalter brown is missinghasnt been seen loafing around any of his usual corners in the villages hereabouts i must have got him with one of my shots though the creatures always seem to try to take their dead and wounded awaygot into town this afternoon without any trouble but am afraid theyre beginning to hold off because theyre sure of me am writing this in brattleboro po this may be goodbyeif it is write my son george goodenough akeley 176 pleasant st san diego calbut dont come up herewrite the boy if you dont hear from me in a week and watch the papers for newsim going to play my last two cards nowif i have the will power left first to try poison gas on the things ive got the right chemicals and have fixed up masks for myself and the dogs and then if that doesnt work tell the sheriff they can lock me in a madhouse if they want toitll be better than what theother creatureswould do perhaps i can get them to pay attention to the prints around the housethey are faint but i can find them every morning suppose though police would say i faked them somehow for they all think im a queer charactermust try to have a state policeman spend a night here and see for himselfthough it would be just like the creatures to learn about it and hold off that night they cut my wires whenever i try to telephone in the nightthe linemen think it is very queer and may testify for me if they dont go and imagine i cut them myself i havent tried to keep them repaired for over a week nowi could get some of the ignorant people to testify for me about the reality of the horrors but everybody laughs at what they say and anyway they have shunned my place for so long that they dont know any of the new events you couldnt get one of those rundown farmers to come within a mile of my house for love or money the mailcarrier hears what they say and jokes me about itgod if i only dared tell him how real it is i think ill try to get him to notice the prints but he comes in the afternoon and theyre usually about gone by that time if i kept one by setting a box or pan over it hed think surely it was a fake or jokewish i hadnt gotten to be such a hermit so folks dont drop around as they used to ive never dared shew the black stone or the kodak pictures or play that record to anybody but the ignorant people the others would say i faked the whole business and do nothing but laugh but i may yet try shewing the pictures they give those clawprints clearly even if the things that made them cant be photographed what a shame nobody else saw thatthingthis morning before it went to nothingbut i dont know as i care after what ive been through a madhouse is as good a place as any the doctors can help me make up my mind to get away from this house and that is all that will save mewrite my son george if you dont hear soon goodbye smash that record and dont mix up in thisyrsakeleythe letter frankly plunged me into the blackest of terror i did not know what to say in answer but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and encouragement and sent them by registered mail i recall urging akeley to move to brattleboro at once and place himself under the protection of the authorities adding that i would come to that town with the phonograph record and help convince the courts of his sanity it was time too i think i wrote to alarm the people generally against this thing in their midst it will be observed that at this moment of stress my own belief in all akeley had told and claimed was virtually complete though i did think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was due not to any freak of nature but to some excited slip of his ownvthen apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me saturday afternoon september 8th came that curiously different and calming letter neatly typed on a new machine that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which must have marked so prodigious a transition in the whole nightmare drama of the lonely hills again i will quote from memoryseeking for special reasons to preserve as much of the flavour of the style as i can it was postmarked bellows falls and the signature as well as the body of the letter was typedas is frequent with beginners in typing the text though was marvellously accurate for a tyros work and i concluded that akeley must have used a machine at some previous periodperhaps in college to say that the letter relieved me would be only fair yet beneath my relief lay a substratum of uneasiness if akeley had been sane in his terror was he now sane in his deliverance and the sort of improved rapport mentioned what was it the entire thing implied such a diametrical reversal of akeleys previous attitude but here is the substance of the text carefully transcribed from a memory in which i take some pridetownshend vermontthursday sept 6 1928my dear wilmarthit gives me great pleasure to be able to set you at rest regarding all the silly things ive been writing you i say silly although by that i mean my frightened attitude rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena those phenomena are real and important enough my mistake had been in establishing an anomalous attitude toward themi think i mentioned that my strange visitors were beginning to communicate with me and to attempt such communication last night this exchange of speech became actual in response to certain signals i admitted to the house a messenger from those outsidea fellowhuman let me hasten to say he told me much that neither you nor i had even begun to guess and shewed clearly how totally we had misjudged and misinterpreted the purpose of the outer ones in maintaining their secret colony on this planetit seems that the evil legends about what they have offered to men and what they wish in connexion with the earth are wholly the result of an ignorant misconception of allegorical speechspeech of course moulded by cultural backgrounds and thoughthabits vastly different from anything we dream of my own conjectures i freely own shot as widely past the mark as any of the guesses of illiterate farmers and savage indians what i had thought morbid and shameful and ignominious is in reality awesome and mindexpanding and evengloriousmy previous estimate being merely a phase of mans eternal tendency to hate and fear and shrink from theutterly differentnow i regret the harm i have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beings in the course of our nightly skirmishes if only i had consented to talk peacefully and reasonably with them in the first place but they bear me no grudge their emotions being organised very differently from ours it is their misfortune to have had as their human agents in vermont some very inferior specimensthe late walter brown for example he prejudiced me vastly against them actually they have never knowingly harmed men but have often been cruelly wronged and spied upon by our species there is a whole secret cult of evil men a man of your mystical erudition will understand me when i link them with hastur and the yellow sign devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions it is against these aggressorsnot against normal humanitythat the drastic precautions of the outer ones are directed incidentally i learned that many of our lost letters were stolen not by the outer ones but by the emissaries of this malign cultall that the outer ones wish of man is peace and nonmolestation and an increasing intellectual rapport this latter is absolutely necessary now that our inventions and devices are expanding our knowledge and motions and making it more and more impossible for the outer ones necessary outposts to existsecretlyon this planet the alien beings desire to know mankind more fully and to have a few of mankinds philosophic and scientific leaders know more about them with such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass and a satisfactorymodus vivendibe established the very idea of any attempt toenslaveordegrademankind is ridiculousas a beginning of this improved rapport the outer ones have naturally chosen mewhose knowledge of them is already so considerableas their primary interpreter on earth much was told me last nightfacts of the most stupendous and vistaopening natureand more will be subsequently communicated to me both orally and in writing i shall not be called upon to make any tripoutsidejust yet though i shall probablywishto do so later onemploying special means and transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as human experience my house will be besieged no longer everything has reverted to normal and the dogs will have no further occupation in place of terror i have been given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure which few other mortals have ever sharedthe outer beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyond all space and timemembers of a cosmoswide race of which all other lifeforms are merely degenerate variants they are more vegetable than animal if these terms can be applied to the sort of matter composing them and have a somewhat fungoid structure though the presence of a chlorophylllike substance and a very singular nutritive system differentiate them altogether from true cormophytic fungi indeed the type is composed of a form of matter totally alien to our part of spacewith electrons having a wholly different vibrationrate that is why the beings cannot be photographed on theordinarycamera films and plates of our known universe even though our eyes can see them with proper knowledge however any good chemist could make a photographic emulsion which would record their imagesthe genus is unique in its ability to traverse the heatless and airless interstellar void in full corporeal form and some of its variants cannot do this without mechanical aid or curious surgical transpositions only a few species have the etherresisting wings characteristic of the vermont variety those inhabiting certain remote peaks in the old world were brought in other ways their external resemblance to animal life and to the sort of structure we understand as material is a matter of parallel evolution rather than of close kinship their braincapacity exceeds that of any other surviving lifeform although the winged types of our hill country are by no means the most highly developed telepathy is their usual means of discourse though they have rudimentary vocal organs which after a slight operation for surgery is an incredibly expert and everyday thing among them can roughly duplicate the speech of such types of organism as still use speechtheir mainimmediateabode is a still undiscovered and almost lightless planet at the very edge of our solar systembeyond neptune and the ninth in distance from the sun it is as we have inferred the object mystically hinted at as yuggoth in certain ancient and forbidden writings and it will soon be the scene of a strange focussing of thought upon our world in an effort to facilitate mental rapport i would not be surprised if astronomers became sufficiently sensitive to these thoughtcurrents to discover yuggoth when the outer ones wish them to do so but yuggoth of course is only the steppingstone the main body of the beings inhabits strangely organised abysses wholly beyond the utmost reach of any human imagination the spacetime globule which we recognise as the totality of all cosmic entity is only an atom in the genuine infinity which is theirsand as much of this infinity as any human brain can hold is eventually to be opened up to me as it has been to not more than fifty other men since the human race has existedyou will probably call this raving at first wilmarth but in time you will appreciate the titanic opportunity i have stumbled upon i want you to share as much of it as is possible and to that end must tell you thousands of things that wont go on paper in the past i have warned you not to come to see me now that all is safe i take pleasure in rescinding that warning and inviting youcant you make a trip up here before your college term opens it would be marvellously delightful if you could bring along the phonograph record and all my letters to you as consultative datawe shall need them in piecing together the whole tremendous story you might bring the kodak prints too since i seem to have mislaid the negatives and my own prints in all this recent excitement but what a wealth of facts i have to add to all this groping and tentative materialand what a stupendous device i have to supplement my additionsdont hesitatei am free from espionage now and you will not meet anything unnatural or disturbing just come along and let my car meet you at the brattleboro stationprepare to stay as long as you can and expect many an evening of discussion of things beyond all human conjecture dont tell anyone about it of coursefor this matter must not get to the promiscuous publicthe train service to brattleboro is not badyou can get a timetable in boston take the b m to greenfield and then change for the brief remainder of the way i suggest your taking the convenient 410 pmstandardfrom boston this gets into greenfield at 735 and at 919 a train leaves there which reaches brattleboro at 1001 that is weekdays let me know the date and ill have my car on hand at the stationpardon this typed letter but my handwriting has grown shaky of late as you know and i dont feel equal to long stretches of script i got this new corona in brattleboro yesterdayit seems to work very wellawaiting word and hoping to see you shortly with the phonograph record and all my lettersand the kodak printsi amyours in anticipationhenry w akeleyto albert n wilmarth esqmiskatonic universityarkham massthe complexity of my emotions upon reading rereading and pondering over this strange and unlookedfor letter is past adequate description i have said that i was at once relieved and made uneasy but this expresses only crudely the overtones of diverse and largely subconscious feelings which comprised both the relief and the uneasiness to begin with the thing was so antipodally at variance with the whole chain of horrors preceding itthe change of mood from stark terror to cool complacency and even exultation was so unheralded lightninglike and complete i could scarcely believe that a single day could so alter the psychological perspective of one who had written that final frenzied bulletin of wednesday no matter what relieving disclosures that day might have brought at certain moments a sense of conflicting unrealities made me wonder whether this whole distantly reported drama of fantastic forces were not a kind of halfillusory dream created largely within my own mind then i thought of the phonograph record and gave way to still greater bewildermentthe letter seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected as i analysed my impression i saw that it consisted of two distinct phases first granting that akeley had been sane before and was still sane the indicated change in the situation itself was so swift and unthinkable and secondly the change in akeleys own manner attitude and language was so vastly beyond the normal or the predictable the mans whole personality seemed to have undergone an insidious mutationa mutation so deep that one could scarcely reconcile his two aspects with the supposition that both represented equal sanity wordchoice spellingall were subtly different and with my academic sensitiveness to prose style i could trace profound divergences in his commonest reactions and rhythmresponses certainly the emotional cataclysm or revelation which could produce so radical an overturn must be an extreme one indeed yet in another way the letter seemed quite characteristic of akeley the same old passion for infinitythe same old scholarly inquisitiveness i could not a momentor more than a momentcredit the idea of spuriousness or malign substitution did not the invitationthe willingness to have me test the truth of the letter in personprove its genuinenessi did not retire saturday night but sat up thinking of the shadows and marvels behind the letter i had received my mind aching from the quick succession of monstrous conceptions it had been forced to confront during the last four months worked upon this startling new material in a cycle of doubt and acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in facing the earlier wonders till long before dawn a burning interest and curiosity had begun to replace the original storm of perplexity and uneasiness mad or sane metamorphosed or merely relieved the chances were that akeley had actually encountered some stupendous change of perspective in his hazardous research some change at once diminishing his dangerreal or fanciedand opening dizzy new vistas of cosmic and superhuman knowledge my own zeal for the unknown flared up to meet his and i felt myself touched by the contagion of the morbid barrierbreaking to shake off the maddening and wearying limitations of time and space and natural lawto be linked with the vastoutsideto come close to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the infinite and the ultimatesurely such a thing was worth the risk of ones life soul and sanity and akeley had said there was no longer any perilhe had invited me to visit him instead of warning me away as before i tingled at the thought of what he might now have to tell methere was an almost paralysing fascination in the thought of sitting in that lonely and lately beleaguered farmhouse with a man who had talked with actual emissaries from outer space sitting there with the terrible record and the pile of letters in which akeley had summarised his earlier conclusionsso late sunday morning i telegraphed akeley that i would meet him in brattleboro on the following wednesdayseptember 12thif that date were convenient for him in only one respect did i depart from his suggestions and that concerned the choice of a train frankly i did not feel like arriving in that haunted vermont region late at night so instead of accepting the train he chose i telephoned the station and devised another arrangement by rising early and taking the 807 am standard into boston i could catch the 925 for greenfield arriving there at 1222 noon this connected exactly with a train reaching brattleboro at 108 pma much more comfortable hour than 1001 for meeting akeley and riding with him into the closepacked secretguarding hillsi mentioned this choice in my telegram and was glad to learn in the reply which came toward evening that it had met with my prospective hosts endorsement his wire ran thusarrangement satisfactory will meet 108 train wednesday dont forget record and letters and prints keep destination quiet expect great revelationsakeleyreceipt of this message in direct response to one sent to akeleyand necessarily delivered to his house from the townshend station either by official messenger or by a restored telephone serviceremoved any lingering subconscious doubts i may have had about the authorship of the perplexing letter my relief was markedindeed it was greater than i could account for at that time since all such doubts had been rather deeply buried but i slept soundly and long that night and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuing two daysvion wednesday i started as agreed taking with me a valise full of simple necessities and scientific data including the hideous phonograph record the kodak prints and the entire file of akeleys correspondence as requested i had told no one where i was going for i could see that the matter demanded utmost privacy even allowing for its most favourable turns the thought of actual mental contact with alien outside entities was stupefying enough to my trained and somewhat prepared mind and this being so what might one think of its effect on the vast masses of uninformed laymen i do not know whether dread or adventurous expectancy was uppermost in me as i changed trains in boston and began the long westward run out of familiar regions into those i knew less thoroughly walthamconcordayerfitchburggardneratholmy train reached greenfield seven minutes late but the northbound connecting express had been held transferring in haste i felt a curious breathlessness as the cars rumbled on through the early afternoon sunlight into territories i had always read of but had never before visited i knew i was entering an altogether olderfashioned and more primitive new england than the mechanised urbanised coastal and southern areas where all my life had been spent an unspoiled ancestral new england without the foreigners and factorysmoke billboards and concrete roads of the sections which modernity has touched there would be odd survivals of that continuous native life whose deep roots make it the one authentic outgrowth of the landscapethe continuous native life which keeps alive strange ancient memories and fertilises the soil for shadowy marvellous and seldommentioned beliefsnow and then i saw the blue connecticut river gleaming in the sun and after leaving northfield we crossed it ahead loomed green and cryptical hills and when the conductor came around i learned that i was at last in vermont he told me to set my watch back an hour since the northern hill country will have no dealings with newfangled daylight time schemes as i did so it seemed to me that i was likewise turning the calendar back a centurythe train kept close to the river and across in new hampshire i could see the approaching slope of steep wantastiquet about which singular old legends cluster then streets appeared on my left and a green island shewed in the stream on my right people rose and filed to the door and i followed them the car stopped and i alighted beneath the long trainshed of the brattleboro stationlooking over the line of waiting motors i hesitated a moment to see which one might turn out to be the akeley ford but my identity was divined before i could take the initiative and yet it was clearly not akeley himself who advanced to meet me with an outstretched hand and a mellowly phrased query as to whether i was indeed mr albert n wilmarth of arkham this man bore no resemblance to the bearded grizzled akeley of the snapshot but was a younger and more urban person fashionably dressed and wearing only a small dark moustache his cultivated voice held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity though i could not definitely place it in my memoryas i surveyed him i heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective hosts who had come down from townshend in his stead akeley he declared had suffered a sudden attack of some asthmatic trouble and did not feel equal to making a trip in the outdoor air it was not serious however and there was to be no change in plans regarding my visit i could not make out just how much this mr noyesas he announced himselfknew of akeleys researches and discoveries though it seemed to me that his casual manner stamped him as a comparative outsider remembering what a hermit akeley had been i was a trifle surprised at the ready availability of such a friend but did not let my puzzlement deter me from entering the motor to which he gestured me it was not the small ancient car i had expected from akeleys descriptions but a large and immaculate specimen of recent patternapparently noyess own and bearing massachusetts licence plates with the amusing sacred codfish device of that year my guide i concluded must be a summer transient in the townshend regionnoyes climbed into the car beside me and started it at once i was glad that he did not overflow with conversation for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made me feel disinclined to talk the town seemed very attractive in the afternoon sunlight as we swept up an incline and turned to the right into the main street it drowsed like the older new england cities which one remembers from boyhood and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and chimneys and brick walls formed contours touching deep violstrings of ancestral emotion i could tell that i was at the gateway of a region halfbewitched through the pilingup of unbroken timeaccumulations a region where old strange things have had a chance to grow and linger because they have never been stirred upas we passed out of brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding increased for a vague quality in the hillcrowded countryside with its towering threatening closepressing green and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and immemorial survivals which might or might not be hostile to mankind for a time our course followed a broad shallow river which flowed down from unknown hills in the north and i shivered when my companion told me it was the west river it was in this stream i recalled from newspaper items that one of the morbid crablike beings had been seen floating after the floodsgradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted archaic covered bridges lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills and the halfabandoned railway track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of desolation there were awesome sweeps of vivid valley where great cliffs rose new englands virgin granite shewing grey and austere through the verdure that scaled the crests there were gorges where untamed streams leaped bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a thousand pathless peaks branching away now and then were narrow halfconcealed roads that bored their way through solid luxuriant masses of forest among whose primal trees whole armies of elemental spirits might well lurk as i saw these i thought of how akeley had been molested by unseen agencies on his drives along this very route and did not wonder that such things could bethe quaint sightly village of newfane reached in less than an hour was our last link with that world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest and complete occupancy after that we cast off all allegiance to immediate tangible and timetouched things and entered a fantastic world of hushed unreality in which the narrow ribbonlike road rose and fell and curved with an almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless green peaks and halfdeserted valleys except for the sound of the motor and the faint stir of the few lonely farms we passed at infrequent intervals the only thing that reached my ears was the gurgling insidious trickle of strange waters from numberless hidden fountains in the shadowy woodsthe nearness and intimacy of the dwarfed domed hills now became veritably breathtaking their steepness and abruptness were even greater than i had imagined from hearsay and suggested nothing in common with the prosaic objective world we know the dense unvisited woods on those inaccessible slopes seemed to harbour alien and incredible things and i felt that the very outline of the hills themselves held some strange and aeonforgotten meaning as if they were vast hieroglyphs left by a rumoured titan race whose glories live only in rare deep dreams all the legends of the past and all the stupefying imputations of henry akeleys letters and exhibits welled up in my memory to heighten the atmosphere of tension and growing menace the purpose of my visit and the frightful abnormalities it postulated struck me all at once with a chill sensation that nearly overbalanced my ardour for strange delvingsmy guide must have noticed my disturbed attitude for as the road grew wilder and more irregular and our motion slower and more jolting his occasional pleasant comments expanded into a steadier flow of discourse he spoke of the beauty and weirdness of the country and revealed some acquaintance with the folklore studies of my prospective host from his polite questions it was obvious that he knew i had come for a scientific purpose and that i was bringing data of some importance but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth and awfulness of the knowledge which akeley had finally reachedhis manner was so cheerful normal and urbane that his remarks ought to have calmed and reassured me but oddly enough i felt only the more disturbed as we bumped and veered onward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods at times it seemed as if he were pumping me to see what i knew of the monstrous secrets of the place and with every fresh utterance that vague teasing bafflingfamiliarityin his voice increased it was not an ordinary or healthy familiarity despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice i somehow linked it with forgotten nightmares and felt that i might go mad if i recognised it if any good excuse had existed i think i would have turned back from my visit as it was i could not well do soand it occurred to me that a cool scientific conversation with akeley himself after my arrival would help greatly to pull me togetherbesides there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnotic landscape through which we climbed and plunged fantastically time had lost itself in the labyrinths behind and around us stretched only the flowering waves of faery and the recaptured loveliness of vanished centuriesthe hoary groves the untainted pastures edged with gay autumnal blossoms and at vast intervals the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge trees beneath vertical precipices of fragrant brier and meadowgrass even the sunlight assumed a supernal glamour as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the whole region i had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the backgrounds of italian primitives sodoma and leonardo conceived such expanses but only in the distance and through the vaultings of renaissance arcades we were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the picture and i seemed to find in its necromancy a thing i had innately known or inherited and for which i had always been vainly searchingsuddenly after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent the car came to a standstill on my left across a wellkept lawn which stretched to the road and flaunted a border of whitewashed stones rose a white twoandahalfstory house of unusual size and elegance for the region with a congeries of contiguous or arcadelinked barns sheds and windmill behind and to the right i recognised it at once from the snapshot i had received and was not surprised to see the name of henry akeley on the galvanisediron mailbox near the road for some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely wooded land extended beyond which soared a steep thickly forested hillside ending in a jagged leafy crest this latter i knew was the summit of dark mountain half way up which we must have climbed alreadyalighting from the car and taking my valise noyes asked me to wait while he went in and notified akeley of my advent he himself he added had important business elsewhere and could not stop for more than a moment as he briskly walked up the path to the house i climbed out of the car myself wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentary conversation my feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that i was on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in akeleys letters and i honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with such alien and forbidden worldsclose contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring and it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where those monstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear and death idly i noticed that none of akeleys dogs seemed to be about had he sold them all as soon as the outer ones made peace with him try as i might i could not have the same confidence in the depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in akeleys final and queerly different letter after all he was a man of much simplicity and with little worldly experience was there not perhaps some deep and sinister undercurrent beneath the surface of the new allianceled by my thoughts my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface which had held such hideous testimonies the last few days had been dry and tracks of all sorts cluttered the rutted irregular highway despite the unfrequented nature of the district with a vague curiosity i began to trace the outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions trying meanwhile to curb the flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested there was something menacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness in the muffled subtle trickle of distant brooks and in the crowding green peaks and blackwooded precipices that choked the narrow horizonand then an image shot into my consciousness which made those vague menaces and flights of fancy seem mild and insignificant indeed i have said that i was scanning the miscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiositybut all at once that curiosity was shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and paralysing gust of active terror for though the dust tracks were in general confused and overlapping and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze my restless vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joined the highway and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance of those details it was not for nothing alas that i had pored for hours over the kodak views of the outer ones clawprints which akeley had sent too well did i know the marks of those loathsome nippers and that hint of ambiguous direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet no chance had been left me for merciful mistake here indeed in objective form before my own eyes and surely made not many hours ago were at least three marks which stood out blasphemously among the surprising plethora of blurred footprints leading to and from the akeley farmhousethey were the hellish tracks of the living fungi from yuggothi pulled myself together in time to stifle a scream after all what more was there than i might have expected assuming that i had really believed akeleys letters he had spoken of making peace with the things why then was it strange that some of them had visited his house but the terror was stronger than the reassurance could any man be expected to look unmoved for the first time upon the clawmarks of animate beings from outer depths of space just then i saw noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step i must i reflected keep command of myself for the chances were this genial friend knew nothing of akeleys profoundest and most stupendous probings into the forbiddenakeley noyes hastened to inform me was glad and ready to see me although his sudden attack of asthma would prevent him from being a very competent host for a day or two these spells hit him hard when they came and were always accompanied by a debilitating fever and general weakness he never was good for much while they lastedhad to talk in a whisper and was very clumsy and feeble in getting about his feet and ankles swelled too so that he had to bandage them like a gouty old beefeater today he was in rather bad shape so that i would have to attend very largely to my own needs but he was none the less eager for conversation i would find him in the study at the left of the front hallthe room where the blinds were shut he had to keep the sunlight out when he was ill for his eyes were very sensitiveas noyes bade me adieu and rode off northward in his car i began to walk slowly toward the house the door had been left ajar for me but before approaching and entering i cast a searching glance around the whole place trying to decide what had struck me as so intangibly queer about it the barns and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough and i noticed akeleys battered ford in its capacious unguarded shelter then the secret of the queerness reached me it was the total silence ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from its various kinds of livestock but here all signs of life were missing what of the hens and the hogs the cows of which akeley had said he possessed several might conceivably be out to pasture and the dogs might possibly have been sold but the absence of any trace of cackling or grunting was truly singulari did not pause long on the path but resolutely entered the open house door and closed it behind me it had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so and now that i was shut inside i had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat not that the place was in the least sinister in visual suggestion on the contrary i thought the graceful latecolonial hallway very tasteful and wholesome and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it what made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable perhaps it was a certain odd odour which i thought i noticedthough i well knew how common musty odours are in even the best of ancient farmhousesviirefusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me i recalled noyess instructions and pushed open the sixpanelled brasslatched white door on my left the room beyond was darkened as i had known before and as i entered it i noticed that the queer odour was stronger there there likewise appeared to be some faint halfimaginary rhythm or vibration in the air for a moment the closed blinds allowed me to see very little but then a kind of apologetic hacking or whispering sound drew my attention to a great easychair in the farther darker corner of the room within its shadowy depths i saw the white blur of a mans face and hands and in a moment i had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak dim though the light was i perceived that this was indeed my host i had studied the kodak picture repeatedly and there could be no mistake about this firm weatherbeaten face with the cropped grizzled beardbut as i looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety for certainly this face was that of a very sick man i felt that there must be something more than asthma behind that strained rigid immobile expression and unwinking glassy stare and realised how terribly the strain of his frightful experiences must have told on him was it not enough to break any human beingeven a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden the strange and sudden relief i feared had come too late to save him from something like a general breakdown there was a touch of the pitiful in the limp lifeless way his lean hands rested in his lap he had on a loose dressinggown and was swathed around the head and high around the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hoodand then i saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper with which he had greeted me it was a hard whisper to catch at first since the grey moustache concealed all movements of the lips and something in its timbre disturbed me greatly but by concentrating my attention i could soon make out its purport surprisingly well the accent was by no means a rustic one and the language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to expectmr wilmarth i presume you must pardon my not rising i am quite ill as mr noyes must have told you but i could not resist having you come just the same you know what i wrote in my last letterthere is so much to tell you tomorrow when i shall feel better i cant say how glad i am to see you in person after all our many letters you have the file with you of course and the kodak prints and record noyes put your valise in the halli suppose you saw it for tonight i fear youll have to wait on yourself to a great extent your room is upstairsthe one over thisand youll see the bathroom door open at the head of the staircase theres a meal spread for you in the diningroomright through this door at your rightwhich you can take whenever you feel like it ill be a better host tomorrowbut just now weakness leaves me helplessmake yourself at homeyou might take out the letters and pictures and record and put them on the table here before you go upstairs with your bag it is here that we shall discuss themyou can see my phonograph on that corner standno thankstheres nothing you can do for me i know these spells of old just come back for a little quiet visiting before night and then go to bed when you please ill rest right hereperhaps sleep here all night as i often do in the morning ill be far better able to go into the things we must go into you realise of course the utterly stupendous nature of the matter before us to us as to only a few men on this earth there will be opened up gulfs of time and space and knowledge beyond anything within the conception of human science and philosophydo you know that einstein is wrong and that certain objects and forcescanmove with a velocity greater than that of light with proper aid i expect to go backward and forward in time and actuallyseeandfeelthe earth of remote past and future epochs you cant imagine the degree to which those beings have carried science there is nothing they cant do with the mind and body of living organisms i expect to visit other planets and even other stars and galaxies the first trip will be to yuggoth the nearest world fully peopled by the beings it is a strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar systemunknown to earthly astronomers as yet but i must have written you about this at the proper time you know the beings there will direct thoughtcurrents toward us and cause it to be discoveredor perhaps let one of their human allies give the scientists a hintthere are mighty cities on yuggothgreat tiers of terraced towers built of black stone like the specimen i tried to send you that came from yuggoth the sun shines there no brighter than a star but the beings need no light they have other subtler senses and put no windows in their great houses and temples light even hurts and hampers and confuses them for it does not exist at all in the black cosmos outside time and space where they came from originally to visit yuggoth would drive any weak man madyet i am going there the black rivers of pitch that flow under those mysterious cyclopean bridgesthings built by some elder race extinct and forgotten before the things came to yuggoth from the ultimate voidsought to be enough to make any man a dante or poe if he can keep sane long enough to tell what he has seenbut rememberthat dark world of fungoid gardens and windowless cities isnt really terrible it is only to us that it would seem so probably this world seemed just as terrible to the beings when they first explored it in the primal age you know they were here long before the fabulous epoch of cthulhu was over and remember all about sunken rlyeh when it was above the waters theyve been inside the earth toothere are openings which human beings know nothing ofsome of them in these very vermont hillsand great worlds of unknown life down there bluelitten knyan redlitten yoth and black lightless nkai its from nkai that frightful tsathoggua cameyou know the amorphous toadlike godcreature mentioned in the pnakotic manuscripts and thenecronomiconand the commoriom mythcycle preserved by the atlantean highpriest klarkashtonbut we will talk of all this later on it must be four or five oclock by this time better bring the stuff from your bag take a bite and then come back for a comfortable chatvery slowly i turned and began to obey my host fetching my valise extracting and depositing the desired articles and finally ascending to the room designated as mine with the memory of that roadside clawprint fresh in my mind akeleys whispered paragraphs had affected me queerly and the hints of familiarity with this unknown world of fungous lifeforbidden yuggothmade my flesh creep more than i cared to own i was tremendously sorry about akeleys illness but had to confess that his hoarse whisper had a hateful as well as pitiful quality if only he wouldntgloatso about yuggoth and its black secretsmy room proved a very pleasant and wellfurnished one devoid alike of the musty odour and disturbing sense of vibration and after leaving my valise there i descended again to greet akeley and take the lunch he had set out for me the diningroom was just beyond the study and i saw that a kitchen ell extended still farther in the same direction on the diningtable an ample array of sandwiches cake and cheese awaited me and a thermosbottle beside a cup and saucer testified that hot coffee had not been forgotten after a wellrelished meal i poured myself a liberal cup of coffee but found that the culinary standard had suffered a lapse in this one detail my first spoonful revealed a faintly unpleasant acrid taste so that i did not take more throughout the lunch i thought of akeley sitting silently in the great chair in the darkened next room once i went in to beg him to share the repast but he whispered that he could eat nothing as yet later on just before he slept he would take some malted milkall he ought to have that dayafter lunch i insisted on clearing the dishes away and washing them in the kitchen sinkincidentally emptying the coffee which i had not been able to appreciate then returning to the darkened study i drew up a chair near my hosts corner and prepared for such conversation as he might feel inclined to conduct the letters pictures and record were still on the large centretable but for the nonce we did not have to draw upon them before long i forgot even the bizarre odour and curious suggestions of vibrationi have said that there were things in some of akeleys lettersespecially the second and most voluminous onewhich i would not dare to quote or even form into words on paper this hesitancy applies with still greater force to the things i heard whispered that evening in the darkened room among the lonely haunted hills of the extent of the cosmic horrors unfolded by that raucous voice i cannot even hint he had known hideous things before but what he had learned since making his pact with the outside things was almost too much for sanity to bear even now i absolutely refuse to believe what he implied about the constitution of ultimate infinity the juxtaposition of dimensions and the frightful position of our known cosmos of space and time in the unending chain of linked cosmosatoms which makes up the immediate supercosmos of curves angles and material and semimaterial electronic organisationnever was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entitynever was an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and force and symmetry i learned whence cthulhufirstcame and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth i guessedfrom hints which made even my informant pause timidlythe secret behind the magellanic clouds and globular nebulae and the black truth veiled by the immemorial allegory of tao the nature of the doels was plainly revealed and i was told the essence though not the source of the hounds of tindalos the legend of yig father of serpents remained figurative no longer and i started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space which thenecronomiconhad mercifully cloaked under the name of azathoth it was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret myth cleared up in concrete terms whose stark morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of ancient and mediaeval mystics ineluctably i was led to believe that the first whisperers of these accursed tales must have had discourse with akeleys outer ones and perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms as akeley now proposed visiting themi was told of the black stone and what it implied and was glad that it had not reached me my guesses about those hieroglyphics had been all too correct and yet akeley now seemed reconciled to the whole fiendish system he had stumbled upon reconciled and eager to probe farther into the monstrous abyss i wondered what beings he had talked with since his last letter to me and whether many of them had been as human as that first emissary he had mentioned the tension in my head grew insufferable and i built up all sorts of wild theories about the queer persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the darkened roomnight was falling now and as i recalled what akeley had written me about those earlier nights i shuddered to think there would be no moon nor did i like the way the farmhouse nestled in the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to dark mountains unvisited crest with akeleys permission i lighted a small oil lamp turned it low and set it on a distant bookcase beside the ghostly bust of milton but afterward i was sorry i had done so for it made my hosts strained immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormal and corpselike he seemed halfincapable of motion though i saw him nod stiffly once in a whileafter what he had told i could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets he was saving for the morrow but at last it developed that his trip to yuggoth and beyondand my own possible participation in itwas to be the next days topic he must have been amused by the start of horror i gave at hearing a cosmic voyage on my part proposed for his head wabbled violently when i shewed my fear subsequently he spoke very gently of how human beings might accomplishand several times had accomplishedthe seemingly impossible flight across the interstellar void it seemedthat complete human bodies did not indeed make the tripbut that the prodigious surgical biological chemical and mechanical skill of the outer ones had found a way to convey human brains without their concomitant physical structurethere was a harmless way to extract a brain and a way to keep the organic residue alive during its absence the bare compact cerebral matter was then immersed in an occasionally replenished fluid within an ethertight cylinder of a metal mined in yuggoth certain electrodes reaching through and connecting at will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the three vital faculties of sight hearing and speech for the winged fungusbeings to carry the braincylinders intact through space was an easy matter then on every planet covered by their civilisation they would find plenty of adjustable facultyinstruments capable of being connected with the encased brains so that after a little fitting these travelling intelligences could be given a full sensory and articulate lifealbeit a bodiless and mechanical oneat each stage of their journeying through and beyond the spacetime continuum it was as simple as carrying a phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of the corresponding make exists of its success there could be no question akeley was not afraid had it not been brilliantly accomplished again and againfor the first time one of the inert wasted hands raised itself and pointed to a high shelf on the farther side of the room there in a neat row stood more than a dozen cylinders of a metal i had never seen beforecylinders about a foot high and somewhat less in diameter with three curious sockets set in an isosceles triangle over the front convex surface of each one of them was linked at two of the sockets to a pair of singularlooking machines that stood in the background of their purport i did not need to be told and i shivered as with ague then i saw the hand point to a much nearer corner where some intricate instruments with attached cords and plugs several of them much like the two devices on the shelf behind the cylinders were huddled togetherthere are four kinds of instruments here wilmarth whispered the voice four kindsthree faculties eachmakes twelve pieces in all you see there are four different sorts of beings presented in those cylinders up there three humans six fungoid beings who cant navigate space corporeally two beings from neptune god if you could see the body this type has on its own planet and the rest entities from the central caverns of an especially interesting dark star beyond the galaxy in the principal outpost inside round hill youll now and then find more cylinders and machinescylinders of extracosmic brains with different senses from any we knowallies and explorers from the uttermost outsideand special machines for giving them impressions and expression in the several ways suited at once to them and to the comprehensions of different types of listeners round hill like most of the beings main outposts all through the various universes is a very cosmopolitan place of course only the more common types have been lent to me for experimentheretake the three machines i point to and set them on the table that tall one with the two glass lenses in frontthen the box with the vacuum tubes and soundingboardand now the one with the metal disc on top now for the cylinder with the label b67 pasted on it just stand in that windsor chair to reach the shelf heavy never mind be sure of the numberb67 dont bother that fresh shiny cylinder joined to the two testing instrumentsthe one with my name on it set b67 on the table near where youve put the machinesand see that the dial switch on all three machines is jammed over to the extreme leftnow connect the cord of the lens machine with the upper socket on the cylinderthere join the tube machine to the lower lefthand socket and the disc apparatus to the outer socket now move all the dial switches on the machines over to the extreme rightfirst the lens one then the disc one and then the tube one thats right i might as well tell you that this is a human beingjust like any of us ill give you a taste of some of the others tomorrowto this day i do not know why i obeyed those whispers so slavishly or whether i thought akeley was mad or sane after what had gone before i ought to have been prepared for anything but this mechanical mummery seemed so like the typical vagaries of crazed inventors and scientists that it struck a chord of doubt which even the preceding discourse had not excited what the whisperer implied was beyond all human beliefyet were not the other things still farther beyond and less preposterous only because of their remoteness from tangible concrete proofas my mind reeled amidst this chaos i became conscious of a mixed grating and whirring from all three machines lately linked to the cylindera grating and whirring which soon subsided into a virtual noiselessness what was about to happen was i to hear a voice and if so what proof would i have that it was not some cleverly concocted radio device talked into by a concealed but closely watching speaker even now i am unwilling to swear just what i heard or just what phenomenon really took place before me but something certainly seemed to take placeto be brief and plain the machine with the tubes and soundbox began to speak and with a point and intelligence which left no doubt that the speaker was actually present and observing us the voice was loud metallic lifeless and plainly mechanical in every detail of its production it was incapable of inflection or expressiveness but scraped and rattled on with a deadly precision and deliberationmr wilmarth it said i hope i do not startle you i am a human being like yourself though my body is now resting safely under proper vitalising treatment inside round hill about a mile and a half east of here i myself am here with youmy brain is in that cylinder and i see hear and speak through these electronic vibrators in a week i am going across the void as i have been many times before and i expect to have the pleasure of mr akeleys company i wish i might have yours as well for i know you by sight and reputation and have kept close track of your correspondence with our friend i am of course one of the men who have become allied with the outside beings visiting our planet i met them first in the himalayas and have helped them in various ways in return they have given me experiences such as few men have ever haddo you realise what it means when i say i have been on thirtyseven different celestial bodiesplanets dark stars and less definable objectsincluding eight outside our galaxy and two outside the curved cosmos of space and time all this has not harmed me in the least my brain has been removed from my body by fissions so adroit that it would be crude to call the operation surgery the visiting beings have methods which make these extractions easy and almost normaland ones body never ages when the brain is out of it the brain i may add is virtually immortal with its mechanical faculties and a limited nourishment supplied by occasional changes of the preserving fluidaltogether i hope most heartily that you will decide to come with mr akeley and me the visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself and to shew them the great abysses that most of us have had to dream about in fanciful ignorance it may seem strange at first to meet them but i know you will be above minding that i think mr noyes will go along toothe man who doubtless brought you up here in his car he has been one of us for yearsi suppose you recognised his voice as one of those on the record mr akeley sent youat my violent start the speaker paused a moment before concludingso mr wilmarth i will leave the matter to you merely adding that a man with your love of strangeness and folklore ought never to miss such a chance as this there is nothing to fear all transitions are painless and there is much to enjoy in a wholly mechanised state of sensation when the electrodes are disconnected one merely drops off into a sleep of especially vivid and fantastic dreamsand now if you dont mind we might adjourn our session till tomorrow good nightjust turn all the switches back to the left never mind the exact order though you might let the lens machine be last good night mr akeleytreat our guest well ready now with those switchesthat was all i obeyed mechanically and shut off all three switches though dazed with doubt of everything that had occurred my head was still reeling as i heard akeleys whispering voice telling me that i might leave all the apparatus on the table just as it was he did not essay any comment on what had happened and indeed no comment could have conveyed much to my burdened faculties i heard him telling me i could take the lamp to use in my room and deduced that he wished to rest alone in the dark it was surely time he rested for his discourse of the afternoon and evening had been such as to exhaust even a vigorous man still dazed i bade my host good night and went upstairs with the lamp although i had an excellent pocket flashlight with mei was glad to be out of that downstairs study with the queer odour and vague suggestions of vibration yet could not of course escape a hideous sense of dread and peril and cosmic abnormality as i thought of the place i was in and the forces i was meeting the wild lonely region the black mysteriously forested slope towering so close behind the house the footprints in the road the sick motionless whisperer in the dark the hellish cylinders and machines and above all the invitations to strange surgery and stranger voyagingsthese things all so new and in such sudden succession rushed in on me with a cumulative force which sapped my will and almost undermined my physical strengthto discover that my guide noyes was the human celebrant in that monstrous bygone sabbatritual on the phonograph record was a particular shock though i had previously sensed a dim repellent familiarity in his voice another special shock came from my own attitude toward my host whenever i paused to analyse it for much as i had instinctively liked akeley as revealed in his correspondence i now found that he filled me with a distinct repulsion his illness ought to have excited my pity but instead it gave me a kind of shudder he was so rigid and inert and corpselikeand that incessant whispering was so hateful and unhumanit occurred to me that this whispering was different from anything else of the kind i had ever heard that despite the curious motionlessness of the speakers moustachescreened lips it had a latent strength and carryingpower remarkable for the wheezings of an asthmatic i had been able to understand the speaker when wholly across the room and once or twice it had seemed to me that the faint but penetrant sounds represented not so much weakness as deliberate repressionfor what reason i could not guess from the first i had felt a disturbing quality in their timbre now when i tried to weigh the matter i thought i could trace this impression to a kind of subconscious familiarity like that which had made noyess voice so hazily ominous but when or where i had encountered the thing it hinted at was more than i could tellone thing was certaini would not spend another night here my scientific zeal had vanished amidst fear and loathing and i felt nothing now but a wish to escape from this net of morbidity and unnatural revelation i knew enough now it must indeed be true that cosmic linkages do existbut such things are surely not meant for normal human beings to meddle withblasphemous influences seemed to surround me and press chokingly upon my senses sleep i decided would be out of the question so i merely extinguished the lamp and threw myself on the bed fully dressed no doubt it was absurd but i kept ready for some unknown emergency gripping in my right hand the revolver i had brought along and holding the pocket flashlight in my left not a sound came from below and i could imagine how my host was sitting there with cadaverous stiffness in the darksomewhere i heard a clock ticking and was vaguely grateful for the normality of the sound it reminded me though of another thing about the region which disturbed methe total absence of animal life there were certainly no farm beasts about and now i realised that even the accustomed nightnoises of wild living things were absent except for the sinister trickle of distant unseen waters that stillness was anomalousinterplanetaryand i wondered what starspawned intangible blight could be hanging over the region i recalled from old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the outer ones and thought of what those tracks in the road might meanviiido not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted or how much of what ensued was sheer dream if i tell you that i awaked at a certain time and heard and saw certain things you will merely answer that i did not wake then and that everything was a dream until the moment when i rushed out of the house stumbled to the shed where i had seen the old ford and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad aimless race over the haunted hills which at last landed meafter hours of jolting and winding through forestthreatened labyrinthsin a village which turned out to be townshendyou will also of course discount everything else in my report and declare that all the pictures recordsounds cylinderandmachine sounds and kindred evidences were bits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing henry akeley you will even hint that he conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoaxthat he had the express shipment removed at keene and that he had noyes make that terrifying wax record it is odd though that noyes has not even yet been identified that he was unknown at any of the villages near akeleys place though he must have been frequently in the region i wish i had stopped to memorise the licencenumber of his caror perhaps it is better after all that i did not for i despite all you can say and despite all i sometimes try to say to myself know that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the halfunknown hillsand that those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men to keep as far as possible from such influences and such emissaries is all that i ask of life in futurewhen my frantic story sent a sheriffs posse out to the farmhouse akeley was gone without leaving a trace his loose dressinggown yellow scarf and footbandages lay on the study floor near his corner easychair and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him the dogs and livestock were indeed missing and there were some curious bulletholes both on the houses exterior and on some of the walls within but beyond this nothing unusual could be detected no cylinders or machines none of the evidences i had brought in my valise no queer odour or vibrationsense no footprints in the road and none of the problematical things i glimpsed at the very lasti stayed a week in brattleboro after my escape making inquiries among people of every kind who had known akeley and the results convince me that the matter is no figment of dream or delusion akeleys queer purchases of dogs and ammunition and chemicals and the cutting of his telephone wires are matters of record while all who knew himincluding his son in californiaconcede that his occasional remarks on strange studies had a certain consistency solid citizens believe he was mad and unhesitatingly pronounce all reported evidences mere hoaxes devised with insane cunning and perhaps abetted by eccentric associates but the lowlier country folk sustain his statements in every detail he had shewed some of these rustics his photographs and black stone and had played the hideous record for them and they all said the footprints and buzzing voice were like those described in ancestral legendsthey said too that suspicious sights and sounds had been noticed increasingly around akeleys house after he found the black stone and that the place was now avoided by everybody except the mail man and other casual toughminded people dark mountain and round hill were both notoriously haunted spots and i could find no one who had ever closely explored either occasional disappearances of natives throughout the districts history were well attested and these now included the semivagabond walter brown whom akeleys letters had mentioned i even came upon one farmer who thought he had personally glimpsed one of the queer bodies at floodtime in the swollen west river but his tale was too confused to be really valuablewhen i left brattleboro i resolved never to go back to vermont and i feel quite certain i shall keep my resolution those wild hills are surely the outpost of a frightful cosmic raceas i doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet has been glimpsed beyond neptune just as those influences had said it would be glimpsed astronomers with a hideous appropriateness they little suspect have named this thing pluto i feel beyond question that it is nothing less than nighted yuggothand i shiver when i try to figure out the real reasonwhyits monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time i vainly try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitantsbut i have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse as i have said i did finally drop into a troubled doze a doze filled with bits of dream which involved monstrous landscapeglimpses just what awaked me i cannot yet say but that i did indeed awake at this given point i feel very certain my first confused impression was of stealthily creaking floorboards in the hall outside my door and of a clumsy muffled fumbling at the latch this however ceased almost at once so that my really clear impressions began with the voices heard from the study below there seemed to be several speakers and i judged that they were controversially engagedby the time i had listened a few seconds i was broad awake for the nature of the voices was such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous the tones were curiously varied and no one who had listened to that accursed phonograph record could harbour any doubts about the nature of at least two of them hideous though the idea was i knew that i was under the same roof with nameless things from abysmal space for those two voices were unmistakably the blasphemous buzzings which the outside beings used in their communication with men the two were individually differentdifferent in pitch accent and tempobut they were both of the same damnable general kinda third voice was indubitably that of a mechanical utterancemachine connected with one of the detached brains in the cylinders there was as little doubt about that as about the buzzings for the loud metallic lifeless voice of the previous evening with its inflectionless expressionless scraping and rattling and its impersonal precision and deliberation had been utterly unforgettable for a time i did not pause to question whether the intelligence behind the scraping was the identical one which had formerly talked to me but shortly afterward i reflected thatanybrain would emit vocal sounds of the same quality if linked to the same mechanical speechproducer the only possible differences being in language rhythm speed and pronunciation to complete the eldritch colloquy there were two actually human voicesone the crude speech of an unknown and evidently rustic man and the other the suave bostonian tones of my erstwhile guide noyesas i tried to catch the words which the stoutly fashioned floor so bafflingly intercepted i was also conscious of a great deal of stirring and scratching and shuffling in the room below so that i could not escape the impression that it was full of living beingsmany more than the few whose speech i could single out the exact nature of this stirring is extremely hard to describe for very few good bases of comparison exist objects seemed now and then to move across the room like conscious entities the sound of their footfalls having something about it like a loose hardsurfaced clatteringas of the contact of illcordinated surfaces of horn or hard rubber it was to use a more concrete but less accurate comparison as if people with loose splintery wooden shoes were shambling and rattling about on the polished board floor on the nature and appearance of those responsible for the sounds i did not care to speculatebefore long i saw that it would be impossible to distinguish any connected discourse isolated wordsincluding the names of akeley and myselfnow and then floated up especially when uttered by the mechanical speechproducer but their true significance was lost for want of continuous context today i refuse to form any definite deductions from them and even their frightful effect on me was one ofsuggestionrather than ofrevelationa terrible and abnormal conclave i felt certain was assembled below me but for what shocking deliberations i could not tell it was curious how this unquestioned sense of the malign and the blasphemous pervaded me despite akeleys assurances of the outsiders friendlinesswith patient listening i began to distinguish clearly between voices even though i could not grasp much of what any of the voices said i seemed to catch certain typical emotions behind some of the speakers one of the buzzing voices for example held an unmistakable note of authority whilst the mechanical voice notwithstanding its artificial loudness and regularity seemed to be in a position of subordination and pleading noyess tones exuded a kind of conciliatory atmosphere the others i could make no attempt to interpret i did not hear the familiar whisper of akeley but well knew that such a sound could never penetrate the solid flooring of my roomi will try to set down some of the few disjointed words and other sounds i caught labelling the speakers of the words as best i know how it was from the speechmachine that i first picked up a few recognisable phrasesthe speechmachine brought it on myself sent back the letters and the record end on it taken in seeing and hearing damn you impersonal force after all fresh shiny cylinder great god first buzzing voice time we stopped

at once in indistinguishable speechmany footsteps including the peculiar loose stirring or clatteringa curious sort of flapping soundthe sound of an automobile starting and recedingsilencethat is the substance of what my ears brought me as i lay rigid upon that strange upstairs bed in the haunted farmhouse among the daemoniac hillslay there fully dressed with a revolver clenched in my right hand and a pocket flashlight gripped in my left i became as i have said broad awake but a kind of obscure paralysis nevertheless kept me inert till long after the last echoes of the sounds had died away i heard the wooden deliberate ticking of the ancient connecticut clock somewhere far below and at last made out the irregular snoring of a sleeper akeley must have dozed off after the strange session and i could well believe that he needed to do sojust what to think or what to do was more than i could decide after all whathadi heard beyond things which previous information might have led me to expect had i not known that the nameless outsiders were now freely admitted to the farmhouse no doubt akeley had been surprised by an unexpected visit from them yet something in that fragmentary discourse had chilled me immeasurably raised the most grotesque and horrible doubts and made me wish fervently that i might wake up and prove everything a dream i think my subconscious mind must have caught something which my consciousness has not yet recognised but what of akeley was he not my friend and would he not have protested if any harm were meant me the peaceful snoring below seemed to cast ridicule on all my suddenly intensified fearswas it possible that akeley had been imposed upon and used as a lure to draw me into the hills with the letters and pictures and phonograph record did those beings mean to engulf us both in a common destruction because we had come to know too much again i thought of the abruptness and unnaturalness of that change in the situation which must have occurred between akeleys penultimate and final letters something my instinct told me was terribly wrong all was not as it seemed that acrid coffee which i refusedhad there not been an attempt by some hidden unknown entity to drug it i must talk to akeley at once and restore his sense of proportion they had hypnotised him with their promises of cosmic revelations but now he must listen to reason we must get out of this before it would be too late if he lacked the will power to make the break for liberty i would supply it or if i could not persuade him to go i could at least go myself surely he would let me take his ford and leave it in a garage at brattleboro i had noticed it in the shedthe door being left unlocked and open now that peril was deemed pastand i believed there was a good chance of its being ready for instant use that momentary dislike of akeley which i had felt during and after the evenings conversation was all gone now he was in a position much like my own and we must stick together knowing his indisposed condition i hated to wake him at this juncture but i knew that i must i could not stay in this place till morning as matters stoodat last i felt able to act and stretched myself vigorously to regain command of my muscles arising with a caution more impulsive than deliberate i found and donned my hat took my valise and started downstairs with the flashlights aid in my nervousness i kept the revolver clutched in my right hand being able to take care of both valise and flashlight with my left why i exerted these precautions i do not really know since i was even then on my way to awaken the only other occupant of the houseas i half tiptoed down the creaking stairs to the lower hall i could hear the sleeper more plainly and noticed that he must be in the room on my leftthe livingroom i had not entered on my right was the gaping blackness of the study in which i had heard the voices pushing open the unlatched door of the livingroom i traced a path with the flashlight toward the source of the snoring and finally turned the beams on the sleepers face but in the next second i hastily turned them away and commenced a catlike retreat to the hall my caution this time springing from reason as well as from instinct for the sleeper on the couch was not akeley at all but my quondam guide noyesjust what the real situation was i could not guess but common sense told me that the safest thing was to find out as much as possible before arousing anybody regaining the hall i silently closed and latched the livingroom door after me thereby lessening the chances of awaking noyes i now cautiously entered the dark study where i expected to find akeley whether asleep or awake in the great corner chair which was evidently his favourite restingplace as i advanced the beams of my flashlight caught the great centretable revealing one of the hellish cylinders with sight and hearing machines attached and with a speechmachine standing close by ready to be connected at any moment this i reflected must be the encased brain i had heard talking during the frightful conference and for a second i had a perverse impulse to attach the speechmachine and see what it would sayit must i thought be conscious of my presence even now since the sight and hearing attachments could not fail to disclose the rays of my flashlight and the faint creaking of the floor beneath my feet but in the end i did not dare meddle with the thing i idly saw that it was the fresh shiny cylinder with akeleys name on it which i had noticed on the shelf earlier in the evening and which my host had told me not to bother looking back at that moment i can only regret my timidity and wish that i had boldly caused the apparatus to speak god knows what mysteries and horrible doubts and questions of identity it might have cleared up but then it may be merciful that i let it alonefrom the table i turned my flashlight to the corner where i thought akeley was but found to my perplexity that the great easychair was empty of any human occupant asleep or awake from the seat to the floor there trailed voluminously the familiar old dressinggown and near it on the floor lay the yellow scarf and the huge footbandages i had thought so odd as i hesitated striving to conjecture where akeley might be and why he had so suddenly discarded his necessary sickroom garments i observed that the queer odour and sense of vibration were no longer in the room what had been their cause curiously it occurred to me that i had noticed them only in akeleys vicinity they had been strongest where he sat and wholly absent except in the room with him or just outside the doors of that room i paused letting the flashlight wander about the dark study and racking my brain for explanations of the turn affairs had takenwould to heaven i had quietly left the place before allowing that light to rest again on the vacant chair as it turned out i did not leave quietly but with a muffled shriek which must have disturbed though it did not quite awake the sleeping sentinel across the hall that shriek and noyess stillunbroken snore are the last sounds i ever heard in that morbiditychoked farmhouse beneath the blackwooded crest of a haunted mountainthat focus of transcosmic horror amidst the lonely green hills and cursemuttering brooks of a spectral rustic landit is a wonder that i did not drop flashlight valise and revolver in my wild scramble but somehow i failed to lose any of these i actually managed to get out of that room and that house without making any further noise to drag myself and my belongings safely into the old ford in the shed and to set that archaic vehicle in motion toward some unknown point of safety in the black moonless night the ride that followed was a piece of delirium out of poe or rimbaud or the drawings of dor but finally i reached townshend that is all if my sanity is still unshaken i am lucky sometimes i fear what the years will bring especially since that new planet pluto has been so curiously discoveredas i have implied i let my flashlight return to the vacant easychair after its circuit of the room then noticing for the first time the presence of certain objects in the seat made inconspicuous by the adjacent loose folds of the empty dressinggown these are the objects three in number which the investigators did not find when they came later on as i said at the outset there was nothing of actual visual horror about them the trouble was in what they led one to infer even now i have my moments of halfdoubtmoments in which i half accept the scepticism of those who attribute my whole experience to dream and nerves and delusionthe three things were damnably clever constructions of their kind and were furnished with ingenious metallic clamps to attach them to organic developments of which i dare not form any conjecture i hopedevoutly hopethat they were the waxen products of a master artist despite what my inmost fears tell me great god that whisperer in darkness with its morbid odour and vibrations sorcerer emissary changeling outsider that hideous repressed buzzing and all the time in that fresh shiny cylinder on the shelf poor devil prodigious surgical biological chemical and mechanical skill for the things in the chair perfect to the last subtle detail of microscopic resemblanceor identitywere the face and hands of henry wentworth akeley,1
i am basil elton keeper of the north point light that my father and grandfather kept before me far from the shore stands the grey lighthouse above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is low but unseen when the tide is high past that beacon for a century have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas in the days of my grandfather there were many in the days of my father not so many and now there are so few that i sometimes feel strangely alone as though i were the last man on our planetfrom far shores came those whitesailed argosies of old from far eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odours linger about strange gardens and gay temples the old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather and told him of these things which in turn he told to my father and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily from the east and i have read more of these things and of many things besides in the books men gave me when i was young and filled with wonderbut more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean blue green grey white or black smooth ruffled or mountainous that ocean is not silent all my days have i watched it and listened to it and i know it well at first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things of things more strange and more distant in space and in time sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath and these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be as of the ways that are for ocean is more ancient than the mountains and freighted with the memories and the dreams of timeout of the south it was that the white ship used to come when the moon was full and high in the heavens out of the south it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea and whether the sea was rough or calm and whether the wind was friendly or adverse it would always glide smoothly and silently its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically one night i espied upon the deck a man bearded and robed and he seemed to beckon me to embark for fair unknown shores many times afterward i saw him under the full moon and ever did he beckon mevery brightly did the moon shine on the night i answered the call and i walked out over the waters to the white ship on a bridge of moonbeams the man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language i seemed to know well and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious south golden with the glow of that full mellow moonand when the day dawned rosy and effulgent i beheld the green shore of far lands bright and beautiful and to me unknown up from the sea rose lordly terraces of verdure treestudded and shewing here and there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples as we drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land the land of zar where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten and when i looked upon the terraces again i saw that what he said was true for among the sights before me were many things i had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean there too were forms and fantasies more splendid than any i had ever known the visions of young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed but we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of zar for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shoreas the white ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of zar we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city and the bearded man said to me this is thalarion the city of a thousand wonders wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom and i looked again at closer range and saw that the city was greater than any city i had known or dreamed of before into the sky the spires of its temples reached so that no man might behold their peaks and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim grey walls over which one might spy only a few roofs weird and ominous yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures i yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate akariel but he gently denied my wish saying into thalarion the city of a thousand wonders many have passed but none returned therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon lathi that reigns over the city so the white ship sailed on past the walls of thalarion and followed for many days a southwardflying bird whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appearedthen came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun from bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that i urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene and the bearded man spoke no word but watched me as we approached the lilylined shore suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which i trembled the wind grew stronger and the air was filled with the lethal charnel odour of plaguestricken towns and uncovered cemeteries and as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last saying this is xura the land of pleasures unattainedso once more the white ship followed the bird of heaven over warm blessed seas fanned by caressing aromatic breezes day after day and night after night did we sail and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land and it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of sonanyl which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch this is the land of fancy and we walked to the verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeamsin the land of sonanyl there is neither time nor space neither suffering nor death and there i dwelt for many aeons green are the groves and pastures bright and fragrant the flowers blue and musical the streams clear and cool the fountains and stately and gorgeous the temples castles and cities of sonanyl of that land there is no bound for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful over the countryside and amidst the splendour of cities rove at will the happy folk of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed happiness for the aeons that i dwelt there i wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon and i viewed by moonlight the sparkling sea the crystal headlands and the placid harbour wherein lay anchored the white shipit was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of tharp that i saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird and felt the first stirrings of unrest then i spoke with the bearded man and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote cathuria which no man hath seen but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the west it is the land of hope and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere or at least so men relate but the bearded man said to me beware of those perilous seas wherein men say cathuria lies in sonanyl there is no pain nor death but who can tell what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the west natheless at the next full moon i boarded the white ship and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbour for untravelled seasand the bird of heaven flew before and led us toward the basalt pillars of the west but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon in my mind i would often picture the unknown land of cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces and would wonder what new delights there awaited me cathuria i would say to myself is the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold its forests are of aloe and sandalwood even as the fragrant groves of camorin and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song on the green and flowery mountains of cathuria stand temples of pink marble rich with carven and painted glories and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grottoborn river narg and the cities of cathuria are cinctured with golden walls and their pavements also are of gold in the gardens of these cities are strange orchids and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber at night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the threecoloured shell of the tortoise and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist and the houses of the cities of cathuria are all palaces each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred narg of marble and porphyry are the houses and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendour of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch dorieb whom some say to be a demigod and others a god high is the palace of dorieb and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls in its wide halls many multitudes assemble and here hang the trophies of the ages and the roof is of pure gold set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus and the floor of the palace is of glass under which flow the cunningly lighted waters of the narg gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely cathuriathus would i speak to myself of cathuria but ever would the bearded man warn me to turn back to the happy shores of sonanyl for sonanyl is known of men while none hath ever beheld cathuriaand on the thirtyfirst day that we followed the bird we beheld the basalt pillars of the west shrouded in mist they were so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summitswhich indeed some say reach even to the heavens and the bearded man again implored me to turn back but i heeded him not for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars i fancied there came the notes of singer and lutanist sweeter than the sweetest songs of sonanyl and sounding mine own praises the praises of me who had voyaged far under the full moon and dwelt in the land of fancyso to the sound of melody the white ship sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and when the music ceased and the mist lifted we beheld not the land of cathuria but a swiftrushing resistless sea over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness then did the bearded man say to me with tears on his cheek we have rejected the beautiful land of sonanyl which we may never behold again the gods are greater than men and they have conquered and i closed my eyes before the crash that i knew would come shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrentout of that crash came darkness and i heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men from the east tempestuous winds arose and chilled me as i crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath my feet then as i heard another crash i opened my eyes and beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse from whence i had sailed so many aeons ago in the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks and as i glanced out over the waste i saw that the light had failed for the first time since my grandfather had assumed its careand in the later watches of the night when i went within the tower i saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when i had left it at the hour i sailed away with the dawn i descended the tower and looked for wreckage upon the rocks but what i found was only this a strange dead bird whose hue was as of the azure sky and a single shattered spar of a whiteness greater than that of the wavetips or of the mountain snowand thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more and though many times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens the white ship from the south came never again,1
ithe orange hotel stands in high street near the railway station in bloemfontein south africa on sunday january 24 1932 four men sat shivering from terror in a room on its third floor one was george c titteridge proprietor of the hotel another was police constable ian de witt of the central station a third was johannes bogaert the local coroner the fourth and apparently the least disorganised of the group was dr cornelius van keulen the coroners physicianon the floor uncomfortably evident amidst the stifling summer heat was the body of a dead manbut this was not what the four were afraid of their glances wandered from the table on which lay a curious assortment of things to the ceiling overhead across whose smooth whiteness a series of huge faltering alphabetical characters had somehow been scrawled in ink and every now and then dr van keulen would glance halffurtively at a worn leather blankbook which he held in his left hand the horror of the four seemed about equally divided among the blankbook the scrawled words on the ceiling and a dead fly of peculiar aspect which floated in a bottle of ammonia on the table also on the table were an open inkwell a pen and writingpad a physicians medical case a bottle of hydrochloric acid and a tumbler about a quarter full of black oxide of manganesethe worn leather book was the journal of the dead man on the floor and had at once made it clear that the name frederick n mason mining properties toronto canada signed in the hotel register was a false one there were other thingsterrible thingswhich it likewise made clear and still other things of far greater terror at which it hinted hideously without making them clear or even fully believable it was the halfbelief of the four men fostered by lives spent close to the black settled secrets of brooding africa which made them shiver so violently in spite of the searing january heatthe blankbook was not a large one and the entries were in a fine handwriting which however grew careless and nervouslooking toward the last it consisted of a series of jottings at first rather irregularly spaced but finally becoming daily to call it a diary would not be quite correct for it chronicled only one set of its writers activities dr van keulen recognised the name of the dead man the moment he opened the cover for it was that of an eminent member of his own profession who had been largely connected with african matters in another moment he was horrified to find this name linked with a dastardly crime officially unsolved which had filled the newspapers some four months before and the farther he read the deeper grew his horror awe and sense of loathing and panichere in essence is the text which the doctor read aloud in that sinister and increasingly noisome room while the three men around him breathed hard fidgeted in their chairs and darted frightened glances at the ceiling the table the thing on the floor and one anotherjournal ofthomas slauenwite mdtouching punishment of henry sargent moore phd of brooklyn new york professor of invertebrate biology in columbia university new york ny prepared to be read after my death for the satisfaction of making public the accomplishment of my revenge which may otherwise never be imputed to me even if it succeedsjanuary 5 1929i have now fully resolved to kill dr henry moore and a recent incident has shewn me how i shall do it from now on i shall follow a consistent line of action hence the beginning of this journalit is hardly necessary to repeat the circumstances which have driven me to this course for the informed part of the public is familiar with all the salient facts i was born in trenton new jersey on april 12 1885 the son of dr paul slauenwite formerly of pretoria transvaal south africa studying medicine as part of my family tradition i was led by my father who died in 1916 while i was serving in france in a south african regiment to specialise in african fevers and after my graduation from columbia spent much time in researches which took me from durban in natal up to the equator itselfin mombasa i worked out my new theory of the transmission and development of remittent fever aided only slightly by the papers of the late government physician sir norman sloane which i found in the house i occupied when i published my results i became at a single stroke a famous authority i was told of the probability of an almost supreme position in the south african health service and even a probable knighthood in the event of my becoming a naturalised citizen and accordingly i took the necessary stepsthen occurred the incident for which i am about to kill henry moore this man my classmate and friend of years in america and africa chose deliberately to undermine my claim to my own theory alleging that sir norman sloane had anticipated me in every essential detail and implying that i had probably found more of his papers than i had stated in my account of the matter to buttress this absurd accusation he produced certain personal letters from sir norman which indeed shewed that the older man had been over my ground and that he would have published his results very soon but for his sudden death this much i could only admit with regret what i could not excuse was the jealous suspicion that i had stolen the theory from sir normans papers the british government sensibly enough ignored these aspersions but withheld the halfpromised appointment and knighthood on the ground that my theory while original with me was not in fact newi could soon see that my career in africa was perceptibly checked though i had placed all my hopes on such a career even to the point of resigning american citizenship a distinct coolness toward me had arisen among the government set in mombasa especially among those who had known sir norman it was then that i resolved to be even with moore sooner or later though i did not know how he had been jealous of my early celebrity and had taken advantage of his old correspondence with sir norman to ruin me this from the friend whom i had myself led to take an interest in africawhom i had coached and inspired till he achieved his present moderate fame as an authority on african entomology even now though i will not deny that his attainments are profound i made him and in return he has ruined me nowsome dayi shall destroy himwhen i saw myself losing ground in mombasa i applied for my present situation in the interiorat mgonga only fifty miles from the uganda line it is a cotton and ivory tradingpost with only eight white men besides myself a beastly hole almost on the equator and full of every sort of fever known to mankind poisonous snakes and insects everywhere and niggers with diseases nobody ever heard of outside medical college but my work is not hard and i have always had plenty of time to plan things to do to henry moore it amuses me to give hisdiptera of central and southern africaa prominent place on my shelf i suppose it actually is a standard manualthey use it at columbia harvard and the u of wisbut my own suggestions are really responsible for half its strong pointslast week i encountered the thing which decided me how to kill moore a party from uganda brought in a black with a queer illness which i cant yet diagnose he was lethargic with a very low temperature and shuffled in a peculiar way most of the others were afraid of him and said he was under some kind of witchdoctor spell but gobo the interpreter said he had been bitten by an insect what it was i cant imaginefor there is only a slight puncture on the arm it is bright red though with a purple ring around it spectrallookingi dont wonder the boys lay it to black magic they seem to have seen cases like it before and say theres really nothing to do about itold nkuru one of the galla boys at the post says it must be the bite of a devilfly which makes its victim waste away gradually and die and then takes hold of his soul and personality if it is still alive itselfflying around with all his likes dislikes and consciousness a queer legendand i dont know of any local insect deadly enough to account for it i gave this sick blackhis name is mevanaa good shot of quinine and took a sample of his blood for testing but havent made much progress there is certainly a strange germ present but i cant even remotely identify it the nearest thing to it is the bacillus one finds in oxen horses and dogs that the tsetsefly has bitten but tsetseflies dont infect human beings and this is too far north for them anywayhoweverthe important thing is that ive decided how to kill moore if this interior region has insects as poisonous as the natives say ill see that he gets a shipment of them from a source he wont suspect and with plenty of assurances that they are harmless trust him to throw overboard all caution when it comes to studying an unknown speciesand then well see how nature takes its course it ought not to be hard to find an insect that scares the blacks so much first to see how poor mevana turns outand then to find my envoy of deathjan 7mevana is no better though i have injected all the antitoxins i know of he has fits of trembling in which he rants affrightedly about the way his soul will pass when he dies into the insect that bit him but between them he remains in a kind of halfstupor heart action still strong so i may pull him through i shall try to for he can probably guide me better than anyone else to the region where he was bittenmeanwhile ill write to dr lincoln my predecessor here for allen the head factor says he had a profound knowledge of the local sicknesses he ought to know about the deathfly if any white man does hes at nairobi now and a black runner ought to get me a reply in a weekusing the railway for half the tripjan 10patient unchanged but i have found what i want it was in an old volume of the local health records which ive been going over diligently while waiting to hear from lincoln thirty years ago there was an epidemic that killed off thousands of natives in uganda and it was definitely traced to a rare fly calledglossina palpalisa sort of cousin of theglossina marsitansor tsetse it lives in the bushes on the shores of lakes and rivers and feeds on the blood of crocodiles antelopes and large mammals when these food animals have the germ of trypanosomiasis or sleepingsickness it picks it up and develops acute infectivity after an incubation period of thirtyone days then for seventyfive days it is sure death to anyone or anything it biteswithout doubt this must be the devilfly the niggers talk about now i know what im heading for hope mevana pulls through ought to hear from lincoln in four or five dayshe has a great reputation for success in things like this my worst problem will be to get the flies to moore without his recognising them with his cursed plodding scholarship it would be just like him to know all about them since theyre actually on recordjan 15just heard from lincoln who confirms all that the records say aboutglossina palpalishe has a remedy for sleepingsickness which has succeeded in a great number of cases when not given too late intermuscular injections of tryparsamide since mevana was bitten about two months ago i dont know how it will workbut lincoln says that cases have been known to drag on eighteen months so possibly im not too late lincoln sent over some of his stuff so ive just given mevana a stiff shot in a stupor now theyve brought his principal wife from the village but he doesnt even recognise her if he recovers he can certainly shew me where the flies are hes a great crocodile hunter according to report and knows all uganda like a book ill give him another shot tomorrowjan 16mevana seems a little brighter today but his heart action is slowing up a bit ill keep up the injections but not overdo themjan 17recovery really pronounced today mevana opened his eyes and shewed signs of actual consciousness though dazed after the injection hope moore doesnt know about tryparsamide theres a good chance he wont since he never leaned much toward medicine mevanas tongue seemed paralysed but i fancy that will pass off if i can only wake him up wouldnt mind a good sleep myself but not of this kindjan 25mevana nearly cured in another week i can let him take me into the jungle he was frightened when he first came toabout having the fly take his personality after he diedbut brightened up finally when i told him he was going to get well his wife ugowe takes good care of him now and i can rest a bit then for the envoys of deathfeb 3mevana is well now and i have talked with him about a hunt for flies he dreads to go near the place where they got him but i am playing on his gratitude besides he has an idea that i can ward off disease as well as cure it his pluck would shame a white mantheres no doubt that hell go i can get off by telling the head factor the trip is in the interest of local health workmarch 12in uganda at last have five boys besides mevana but they are all gallas the local blacks couldnt be hired to come near the region after the talk of what had happened to mevana this jungle is a pestilential placesteaming with miasmal vapours all the lakes look stagnant in one spot we came upon a trace of cyclopean ruins which made even the gallas run past in a wide circle they say these megaliths are older than man and that they used to be a haunt or outpost of the fishers from outsidewhatever that meansand of the evil gods tsadogwa and clulu to this day they are said to have a malign influence and to be connected somehow with the devilfliesmarch 15struck lake mlolo this morningwhere mevana was bitten a hellish greenscummed affair full of crocodiles mevana has fixed up a flytrap of fine wire netting baited with crocodile meat it has a small entrance and once the quarry get in they dont know enough to get out as stupid as they are deadly and ravenous for fresh meat or a bowl of blood hope we can get a good supply ive decided that i must experiment with themfinding a way to change their appearance so that moore wont recognise them possibly i can cross them with some other species producing a strange hybrid whose infectioncarrying capacity will be undiminished well see i must wait but am in no hurry now when i get ready ill have mevana get me some infected meat to feed my envoys of deathand then for the postoffice ought to be no trouble getting infection for this country is a veritable pestholemarch 16good luck two cages full five vigorous specimens with wings glistening like diamonds mevana is emptying them into a large can with a tightly meshed top and i think we caught them in the nick of time we can get them to mgonga without trouble taking plenty of crocodile meat for their food undoubtedly all or most of it is infectedapril 20back at mgonga and busy in the laboratory have sent to dr joost in pretoria for some tsetseflies for hybridisation experiments such a crossing if it will work at all ought to produce something pretty hard to recognise yet at the same time just as deadly as thepalpalisif this doesnt work i shall try certain other diptera from the interior and i have sent to dr vandervelde at nyangwe for some of the congo types i shant have to send mevana for more tainted meat after all for i find i can keep cultures of the germtrypanosoma gambiensetaken from the meat we got last month almost indefinitely in tubes when the time comes ill taint some fresh meat and feed my winged envoys a good dosethenbon voyageto themjune 18my tsetseflies from joost came today cages for breeding were all ready long ago and i am now making selections intend to use ultraviolet rays to speed up the lifecycle fortunately i have the needed apparatus in my regular equipment naturally i tell no one what im doing the ignorance of the few men here makes it easy for me to conceal my aims and pretend to be merely studying existing species for medical reasonsjune 29the crossing is fertile good deposits of eggs last wednesday and now i have some excellent larvae if the mature insects look as strange as these do i need do nothing more am preparing separate numbered cages for the different specimensjuly 7new hybrids are out disguise is excellent as to shape but sheen of wings still suggestspalpalisthorax has faint suggestions of the stripes of the tsetse slight variation in individuals am feeding them all on tainted crocodile meat and after infectivity develops will try them on some of the blacksapparently of course by accident there are so many mildly venomous flies around here that it can easily be done without exciting suspicion i shall loose an insect in my tightly screened diningroom when batta my houseboy brings in breakfastkeeping well on guard myself when it has done its work ill capture or swat itan easy thing because of its stupidityor asphyxiate it by filling the room with chlorine gas if it doesnt work the first time ill try again until it does of course ill have the tryparsamide handy in case i get bitten myselfbut i shall be careful to avoid biting for no antidote is really certainaug 10infectivity mature and managed to get batta stung in fine shape caught the fly on him returning it to its cage eased up the pain with iodine and the poor devil is quite grateful for the service shall try a variant specimen on gamba the factors messenger tomorrow that will be all the tests i shall dare to make here but if i need more i shall take some specimens to ukala and get additional dataaug 11failed to get gamba but recaptured the fly alive batta still seems as well as usual and has no pain in the back where he was stung shall wait before trying to get gamba againaug 14shipment of insects from vandervelde at last fully seven distinct species some more or less poisonous am keeping them well fed in case the tsetse crossing doesnt work some of these fellows look very unlike thepalpalisbut the trouble is that they may not make a fertile cross with itaug 17got gamba this afternoon but had to kill the fly on him it nipped him in the left shoulder i dressed the bite and gamba is as grateful as batta was no change in battaaug 20gamba unchanged so farbatta too am experimenting with a new form of disguise to supplement the hybridisationsome sort of dye to change the telltale glitter of thepalpaliswings a bluish tint would be bestsomething i could spray on a whole batch of insects shall begin by investigating things like prussian and turnbulls blueiron and cyanogen saltsaug 25batta complained of a pain in his back todaythings may be developingsept 3have made fair progress in my experiments batta shews signs of lethargy and says his back aches all the time gamba beginning to feel uneasy in his bitten shouldersept 24batta worse and worse and beginning to get frightened about his bite thinks it must be a devilfly and entreated me to kill itfor he saw me cage ituntil i pretended to him that it had died long ago said he didnt want his soul to pass into it upon his death i give him shots of plain water with a hypodermic to keep his morale up evidently the fly retains all the properties of thepalpalisgamba down too and repeating all of battas symptoms i may decide to give him a chance with tryparsamide for the effect of the fly is proved well enough i shall let batta go on however for i want a rough idea of how long it takes to finish a casedye experiments coming along finely an isomeric form of ferrous ferrocyanide with some admixture of potassium salts can be dissolved in alcohol and sprayed on the insects with splendid effect it stains the wings blue without affecting the dark thorax much and doesnt wear off when i sprinkle the specimens with water with this disguise i think i can use the present tsetse hybrids and avoid bothering with any more experiments sharp as he is moore couldnt recognise a bluewinged fly with a halftsetse thorax of course i keep all this dye business strictly under cover nothing must ever connect me with the blue flies later onoct 9batta is lethargic and has taken to his bed have been giving gamba tryparsamide for two weeks and fancy hell recoveroct 25batta very low but gamba nearly wellnov 18batta died yesterday and a curious thing happened which gave me a real shiver in view of the native legends and battas own fears when i returned to the laboratory after the death i heard the most singular buzzing and thrashing in cage 12 which contained the fly that bit batta the creature seemed frantic but stopped still when i appearedlighting on the wire netting and looking at me in the oddest way it reached its legs through the wires as if it were bewildered when i came back from dining with allen the thing was dead evidently it had gone wild and beaten its life out on the sides of the cageit certainly is peculiar that this should happen just as batta died if any black had seen it hed have laid it at once to the absorption of the poor devils soul i shall start my bluestained hybrids on their way before long now the hybrids rate of killing seems a little ahead of the purepalpalisrate if anything batta died three months and eight days after infectionbut of course there is always a wide margin of uncertainty i almost wish i had let gambas case run ondec 5busy planning how to get my envoys to moore i must have them appear to come from some disinterested entomologist who has read hisdiptera of central and southern africaand believes he would like to study this new and unidentifiable species there must also be ample assurances that the bluewinged fly is harmless as proved by the natives long experience moore will be off his guard and one of the flies will surely get him sooner or laterthough one cant tell just whenill have to rely on the letters of new york friendsthey still speak of moore from time to timeto keep me informed of early results though i dare say the papers will announce his death above all i must shew no interest in his case i shall mail the flies while on a trip but must not be recognised when i do it the best plan will be to take a long vacation in the interior grow a beard mail the package at ukala while passing as a visiting entomologist and return here after shaving off the beardapril 12 1930back in mgonga after my long trip everything has come off finelywith clockwork precision have sent the flies to moore without leaving a trace got a christmas vacation dec 15th and set out at once with the proper stuff made a very good mailing container with room to include some germtainted crocodile meat as food for the envoys by the end of february i had beard enough to shape into a close vandykeshewed up at ukala march 9th and typed a letter to moore on the tradingpost machine signed it nevil waylandhallsupposed to be an entomologist from london think i took just the right toneinterest of a brotherscientist and all that was artistically casual in emphasising the complete harmlessness of the specimens nobody suspected anything shaved the beard as soon as i hit the bush so that there wouldnt be any uneven tanning by the time i got back here dispensed with native bearers except for one small stretch of swampi can do wonders with one knapsack and my sense of direction is good lucky im used to such travelling explained my protracted absence by pleading a touch of fever and some mistakes in direction when going through the bushbut now comes the hardest part psychologicallywaiting for news of moore without shewing the strain of course he may possibly escape a bite until the venom is played outbut with his recklessness the chances are one hundred to one against him i have no regrets after what he did to me he deserves this and morejune 30 1930hurrah the first step worked just heard casually from dyson of columbia that moore had received some new bluewinged flies from africa and that he is badly puzzled over them no word of any bitebut if i know moores slipshod ways as i think i do therell be one before longaugust 27 1930letter from morton in cambridge he says moore writes of feeling very rundown and tells of an insect bite on the back of his neckfrom a curious new specimen that he received about the middle of june have i succeeded apparently moore doesnt connect the bite with his weakness if this is the real stuff then moore was bitten well within the insects period of infectivitysept 12 1930victory another line from dyson says that moore is really in an alarming shape he now traces his illness to the bite which he received around noon on june 19 and is quite bewildered about the identity of the insect is trying to get in touch with the nevil waylandhall who sent him the shipment of the hundredodd that i sent about twentyfive seem to have reached him alive some escaped at the time of the bite but several larvae have appeared from eggs laid since the time of mailing he is dyson says carefully incubating these larvae when they mature i suppose hell identify the tsetsepalpalishybridisationbut that wont do him much good now hell wonder though why the blue wings arent transmitted by hereditynov 8 1930letters from half a dozen friends tell of moores serious illness dysons came today he says moore is utterly at sea about the hybrids that came from the larvae and is beginning to think that the parents got their blue wings in some artificial way has to stay in bed most of the time now no mention of using tryparsamidefeb 13 1931not so good moore is sinking and seems to know no remedy but i think he suspects me had a very chilly letter from morton last month which told nothing of moore and now dyson writesalso rather constrainedlythat moore is forming theories about the whole matter hes been making a search for waylandhall by telegraphat london ukala nairobi mombasa and other placesand of course finds nothing i judge that hes told dyson whom he suspects but that dyson doesnt believe it yet fear morton does believe iti see that id better lay plans for getting out of here and effacing my identity for good what an end to a career that started out so well more of moores workbut this time hes paying for it in advance believe ill go back to south africaand meanwhile will quietly deposit funds there to the credit of my new selffrederick nasmyth mason of toronto canada broker in mining properties will establish a new signature for identification if i never have to take the step i can easily retransfer the funds to my present selfaug 15 1931half a year gone and still suspense dyson and mortonas well as several other friendsseem to have stopped writing me dr james of san francisco hears from moores friends now and then and says moore is in an almost continuous coma he hasnt been able to walk since may as long as he could talk he complained of being cold now he cant talk though it is thought he still has glimmers of consciousness his breathing is short and quick and can be heard some distance away no question but thattrypanosoma gambienseis feeding on himbut he holds out better than the niggers around here three months and eight days finished batta and here moore is alive over a year after his biting heard rumours last month of an intensive search around ukala for waylandhall dont think i need to worry yet though for theres absolutely nothing in existence to link me with this businessoct 7 1931its over at last news in themombasagazettemoore died september 20 after a series of trembling fits and with a temperature vastly below normal so much for that i said id get him and i did the paper had a threecolumn report of his long illness and death and of the futile search for waylandhall obviously moore was a bigger character in africa than i had realised the insect that bit him has now been fully identified from the surviving specimens and developed larvae and the wingstaining is also detected it is universally realised that the flies were prepared and shipped with intent to kill moore it appears communicated certain suspicions to dyson but the latterand the policeare maintaining secrecy because of absence of proof all of moores enemies are being looked up and the associated press hints that an investigation possibly involving an eminent physician now abroad will followone thing at the very end of the reportundoubtedly the cheap romancing of a yellow journalistgives me a curious shudder in view of the legends of the blacks and the way the fly happened to go wild when batta died it seems that an odd incident occurred on the night of moores death dyson having been aroused by the buzzing of a bluewinged flywhich immediately flew out the windowjust before the nurse telephoned the death news from moores home miles away in brooklynbut what concerns me most is the african end of the matter people at ukala remember the bearded stranger who typed the letter and sent the package and the constabulary are combing the country for any blacks who may have carried him i didnt use many but if officers question the ubandes who took me through nkini jungle belt ill have more to explain than i like it looks as if the time has come for me to vanish so tomorrow i believe ill resign and prepare to start for parts unknownnov 9 1931hard work getting my resignation acted on but release came today i didnt want to aggravate suspicion by decamping outright last week i heard from james about moores deathbut nothing more than is in the papers those around him in new york seem rather reticent about details though they all talk about a searching investigation no word from any of my friends in the east moore must have spread some dangerous suspicions around before he lost consciousnessbut there isnt an iota of proof he could have adducedstill i am taking no chances on thursday i shall start for mombasa and when there will take a steamer down the coast to durban after that i shall drop from sightbut soon afterward the mining properties broker frederick nasmyth mason from toronto will turn up in johannesburglet this be the end of my journal if in the end i am not suspected it will serve its original purpose after my death and reveal what would otherwise not be known if on the other hand these suspicions do materialise and persist it will confirm and clarify the vague charges and fill in many important and puzzling gaps of course if danger comes my way i shall have to destroy itwell moore is deadas he amply deserves to be now dr thomas slauenwite is dead too and when the body formerly belonging to thomas slauenwite is dead the public may have this recordiijan 15 1932a new yearand a reluctant reopening of this journal this time i am writing solely to relieve my mind for it would be absurd to fancy that the case is not definitely closed i am settled in the vaal hotel johannesburg under my new name and no one has so far challenged my identity have had some inconclusive business talks to keep up my part as a mine broker and believe i may actually work myself into that business later i shall go to toronto and plant a few evidences for my fictitious pastbut what is bothering me is an insect that invaded my room around noon today of course i have had all sorts of nightmares about blue flies of late but those were only to be expected in view of my prevailing nervous strain this thing however was a waking actuality and i am utterly at a loss to account for it it buzzed around my bookshelf for fully a quarter of an hour and eluded every attempt to catch or kill it the queerest thing was its colour and aspectfor it had blue wings and was in every way a duplicate of my hybrid envoys of death how it could possibly be one of these in fact i certainly dont know i disposed of all the hybridsstained and unstainedthat i didnt send to moore and cant recall any instance of escapecan this be wholly an hallucination or could any of the specimens that escaped in brooklyn when moore was bitten have found their way back to africa there was that absurd story of the blue fly that waked dyson when moore diedbut after all the survival and return of some of the things is not impossible it is perfectly plausible that the blue should stick to their wings too for the pigment i devised was almost as good as tattooing for permanence by elimination that would seem to be the only rational explanation for this thing though it is very curious that the fellow has come as far south as this possibly its some hereditary homing instinct inherent in the tsetse strain after all that side of him belongs to south africai must be on my guard against a bite of course the original venomif this is actually one of the flies that escaped from moorewas worn out ages ago but the fellow must have fed as he flew back from america and he may well have come through central africa and picked up a fresh infectivity indeed thats more probable than not for thepalpalishalf of his heredity would naturally take him back to uganda and all the trypanosomiasis germs i still have some of the tryparsamide lefti couldnt bear to destroy my medicine case incriminating though it may bebut since reading up on the subject i am not so sure about the drugs action as i was it gives one a fighting chancecertainly it saved gambabut theres always a large probability of failureits devilish queer that this fly should have happened to come into my roomof all places in the wide expanse of africa seems to strain coincidence to the breakingpoint i suppose that if it comes again i shall certainly kill it im surprised that it escaped me today for ordinarily these fellows are extremely stupid and easy to catch can it be a pure illusion after all certainly the heat is getting me of late as it never did beforeeven up around ugandajan 16am i going insane the fly came again this noon and acted so anomalously that i cant make head or tail of it only delusion on my part could account for what that buzzing pest seemed to do it appeared from nowhere and went straight to my bookshelfcircling again and again to front a copy of mooresdiptera of central and southern africanow and then it would light on top or back of the volume and occasionally it would dart forward toward me and retreat before i could strike at it with a folded paper such cunning is unheard of among the notoriously stupid african diptera for nearly half an hour i tried to get the cursed thing but at last it darted out the window through a hole in the screen that i hadnt noticed at times i fancied it deliberately mocked me by coming within reach of my weapon and then skilfully sidestepping as i struck out i must keep a tight hold of my consciousnessjan 17either i am mad or the world is in the grip of some sudden suspension of the laws of probability as we know them that damnable fly came in from somewhere just before noon and commenced buzzing around the copy of mooresdipteraon my shelf again i tried to catch it and again yesterdays experience was repeated finally the pest made for the open inkwell on my table and dipped itself injust the legs and thorax keeping its wings clear then it sailed up to the ceiling and litbeginning to crawl around in a curved patch and leaving a trail of ink after a time it hopped a bit and made a single ink spot unconnected with the trailthen it dropped squarely in front of my face and buzzed out of sight before i could get itsomething about this whole business struck me as monstrously sinister and abnormalmore so than i could explain to myself when i looked at the inktrail on the ceiling from different angles it seemed more and more familiar to me and it dawned on me suddenly that it formed an absolutely perfect questionmark what device could be more malignly appropriate it is a wonder that i did not faint so far the hotel attendants have not noticed it have not seen the fly this afternoon and evening but am keeping my inkwell securely closed i think my extermination of moore must be preying on me and giving me morbid hallucinations perhaps there is no fly at alljan 18into what strange hell of living nightmare am i plunged what occurred today is something which could not normally happenand yet an hotel attendant has seen the marks on the ceiling and concedes their realityabout eleven oclock this morning as i was writing on a manuscript something darted down to the inkwell for a second and flashed aloft again before i could see what it was looking up i saw that hellish fly on the ceiling as it had been beforecrawling along and tracing another trail of curves and turns there was nothing i could do but i folded a newspaper in readiness to get the creature if it should fly near enough when it had made several turns on the ceiling it flew into a dark corner and disappeared and as i looked upward at the doubly defaced plastering i saw that the new inktrail was that of a huge and unmistakable figure 5for a time i was almost unconscious from a wave of nameless menace for which i could not fully account then i summoned up my resolution and took an active step going out to a chemists shop i purchased some gum and other things necessary for preparing a sticky trapalso a duplicate inkwell returning to my room i filled the new inkwell with the sticky mixture and set it where the old one had been leaving it open then i tried to concentrate my mind on some reading about three oclock i heard the accursed insect again and saw it circling around the new inkwell it descended to the sticky surface but did not touch it and afterward sailed straight toward meretreating before i could hit it then it went to the bookshelf and circled around moores treatise there is something profound and diabolic about the way the intruder hovers near that bookthe worst part was the last leaving moores book the insect flew over to the open window and began beating itself rhythmically against the wire screen there would be a series of beats and then a series of equal length and another pause and so on something about this performance held me motionless for a couple of moments but after that i went over to the window and tried to kill the noxious thing as usual no use it merely flew across the room to a lamp and began beating the same tattoo on the stiff cardboard shade i felt a vague desperation and proceeded to shut all the doors as well as the window whose screen had the imperceptible hole it seemed very necessary to kill this persistent being whose hounding was rapidly unseating my mind then unconsciously counting i began to notice that each of its series of beatings contained justfivestrokesfivethe same number that the thing had traced in ink on the ceiling in the morning could there be any conceivable connexion the notion was maniacal for that would argue a human intellect and a knowledge of written figures in the hybrid fly a human intellectdid not that take one back to the most primitive legends of the uganda blacks and yet there was that infernal cleverness in eluding me as contrasted with the normal stupidity of the breed as i laid aside my folded paper and sat down in growing horror the insect buzzed aloft and disappeared through a hole in the ceiling where the radiator pipe went to the room abovethe departure did not soothe me for my mind had started on a train of wild and terrible reflections if this fly had a human intelligence where did that intelligence come from was there any truth in the native notion that these creatures acquire the personality of their victims after the latters death if so whose personality did this fly bear i had reasoned out that it must be one of those which escaped from moore at the time he was bittenwas this the envoy of death which had bitten moore if so what did it want with mewhat did it want with me anyway in a cold perspiration i remembered the actions of the fly that had bitten batta when batta died had its own personality been displaced by that of its dead victim then there was that sensational news account of the fly that waked dyson when moore died as for that fly that was hounding mecould it be that a vindictive human personality drove it on how it hovered around moores booki refused to think any farther than that all at once i began to feel sure that the creature was indeed infected and in the most virulent way with a malign deliberation so evident in every act it must surely have charged itself on purpose with the deadliest bacilli in all africa my mind thoroughly shaken was now taking the things human qualities for grantedi now telephoned the clerk and asked for a man to stop up the radiator pipehole and other possible chinks in my room i spoke of being tormented by flies and he seemed to be quite sympathetic when the man came i shewed him the inkmarks on the ceiling which he recognised without difficulty so they are real the resemblance to a questionmark and a figure 5 puzzled and fascinated him in the end he stopped up all the holes he could find and mended the windowscreen so that i can now keep both windows open he evidently thought me a bit eccentric especially since no insects were in sight while he was here but i am past minding that so far the fly has not appeared this evening god knows what it is what it wants or what will become of mejan 19i am utterly engulfed in horrorthe thing has touched mesomething monstrous and daemoniac is at work around me and i am a helpless victim in the morning when i returned from breakfast that winged fiend from hell brushed into the room over my head and began beating itself against the windowscreen as it did yesterday this time though each series of beats contained onlyfourstrokes i rushed to the window and tried to catch it but it escaped as usual and flew over to moores treatise where it buzzed around mockingly its vocal equipment is limited but i noticed that its spells of buzzing came in groups of fourby this time i was certainly mad for i called out to itmoore moore for gods sake what do you wantwhen i did so the creature suddenly ceased its circling flew toward me and made a low graceful dip in the air somehow suggestive of a bow then it flew back to the book at least i seemed to see it do all thisthough i am trusting my senses no longerand then the worst thing happened i had left my door open hoping the monster would leave if i could not catch it but about 1130 i shut the door concluding it had gone then i settled down to read just at noon i felt a tickling on the back of my neck but when i put my hand up nothing was there in a moment i felt the tickling againand before i could move that nameless spawn of hell sailed into view from behind did another of those mocking graceful dips in the air and flew out through the keyholewhich i had never dreamed was large enough to allow its passagethat the thing had touched me i could not doubt it had touched me without injuring meand then i remembered in a sudden cold fright that moore had been bitten on theback of the neck at noonno invasion since thenbut i have stuffed all the keyholes with paper and shall have a folded paper ready for use whenever i open the door to leave or enterjan 20i cannot yet believe fully in the supernatural yet i fear none the less that i am lost the business is too much for me just before noon today that devil appearedoutsidethe window and repeated its beating operations but this time in series ofthreewhen i went to the window it flew off out of sight i still have resolution enough to take one more defensive step removing both windowscreens i coated them with my sticky preparationthe one i used in the inkwelloutside and inside and set them back in place if that creature attempts another tattoo it will be its lastrest of the day in peace can i weather this experience without becoming a maniacjan 21on board train for bloemfonteini am routed the thing is winning it has a diabolic intelligence against which all my devices are powerless it appeared outside the window this morningbut did not touch the sticky screeninstead it sheered off without lighting and began buzzing around in circlestwo at a timefollowed by a pause in the air after several of these performances it flew off out of sight over the roofs of the city my nerves are just about at the breakingpoint for thesesuggestions of numbersare capable of a hideous interpretation monday the thing dwelt on the figurefivetuesday it wasfourwednesday it wasthreeand now today it istwo five four three twowhat can this be save some monstrous and unthinkablecountingoff of daysfor what purpose only the evil powers of the universe can know i spent all the afternoon packing and arranging about my trunks and now i have taken the night express for bloemfontein flight may be useless but what else can one dojan 22settled at the orange hotel bloemfonteina comfortable and excellent placebut the horror followed me i had shut all the doors and windows stopped all the keyholes looked for any possible chinks and pulled down all the shadesbut just before noon i heard a dull tap on one of the windowscreens i waitedand after a long pause another tap came a second pause and still another single tap raising the shade i saw that accursed fly as i had expected it described one large slow circle in the air and then flew out of sight i was left as weak as a rag and had to rest on the couchonethis was clearly the burden of the monsters present messageonetaponecircle did this meanonemore day for me before some unthinkable doom ought i to flee again or entrench myself here by sealing up the roomafter an hours rest i felt able to act and ordered a large reserve supply of canned and packaged foodalso linen and towelssent in tomorrow i shall not under any circumstances open any crevice of door or window when the food and linen came the black looked at me queerly but i no longer care how eccentricor insanei may appear i am hounded by powers worse than the ridicule of mankind having received my supplies i went over every square millimeter of the walls and stopped up every microscopic opening i could find at last i feel able to get real sleephandwriting here becomes irregular nervous and very difficult to decipherjan 23it is just before noon and i feel that something very terrible is about to happen didnt sleep as late as i expected even though i got almost no sleep on the train the night before up early and have had trouble getting concentrated on anythingreading or writing that slow deliberate countingoff of days is too much for me i dont know which has gone wildnature or my head until about eleven i did very little except walk up and down the roomthen i heard a rustle among the food packages brought in yesterday and that daemoniac fly crawled out before my eyes i grabbed something flat and made passes at the thing despite my panic fear but with no more effect than usual as i advanced that bluewinged horror retreated as usual to the table where i had piled my books and lit for a second on mooresdiptera of central and southern africathen as i followed it flew over to the mantel clock and lit on the dial near the figure 12 before i could think up another move it had begun to crawl around the dial very slowly and deliberatelyin the direction of the hands it passed under the minute hand curved down and up passed under the hour hand and finally came to a stop exactly at the figure 12 as it hovered there it fluttered its wings with a buzzing noiseis this a portent of some sort i am getting as superstitious as the blacks the hour is now a little after eleven is twelve the end i have just one last resort brought to my mind through utter desperation wish i had thought of it before recalling that my medicine case contains both of the substances necessary to generate chlorine gas i have resolved to fill the room with that lethal vapourasphyxiating the fly while protecting myself with an ammoniasealed handkerchief tied over my face fortunately i have a good supply of ammonia this crude mask will probably neutralise the acrid chlorine fumes till the insect is deador at least helpless enough to crush but i must be quick how can i be sure that the thing will not suddenly dart for me before my preparations are complete i ought not to be stopping to write in this journallaterboth chemicalshydrochloric acid and manganese dioxideon the table all ready to mix ive tied the handkerchief over my nose and mouth and have a bottle of ammonia ready to keep it soaked until the chlorine is gone have battened down both windows but i dont like the actions of that hybrid daemon it stays on the clock but is very slowly crawling around backward from the 12 mark to meet the gradually advancing minutehandis this to be my last entry in this journal it would be useless to try to deny what i suspect too often a grain of incredible truth lurks behind the wildest and most fantastic of legends is the personality of henry moore trying to get at me through this bluewinged devil is this the fly that bit him and that in consequence absorbed his consciousness when he died if so and if it bites me will my own personality displace moores and enter that buzzing body when i die of the bite later on perhaps though i need not die even if it gets me there is always a chance with tryparsamide and i regret nothing moore had to die be the outcome what it willslightly laterthe fly has paused on the clockdial near the 45minute mark it is now 1130 i am saturating the handkerchief over my face with ammonia and keeping the bottle handy for further applications this will be the final entry before i mix the acid and manganese and liberate the chlorine i ought not to be losing time but it steadies me to get things down on paper but for this record id have lost all my reason long ago the fly seems to be getting restless and the minutehand is approaching it now for the chlorine end of the journalon sunday jan 24 1932 after repeated knocking had failed to gain any response from the eccentric man in room 303 of the orange hotel a black attendant entered with a pass key and at once fled shrieking downstairs to tell the clerk what he had found the clerk after notifying the police summoned the manager and the latter accompanied constable de witt coroner bogaert and dr van keulen to the fatal roomthe occupant lay dead on the floorhis face upward and bound with a handkerchief which smelled strongly of ammonia under this covering the features shewed an expression of stark utter fear which transmitted itself to the observers on the back of the neck dr van keulen found a virulent insect bitedark red with a purple ring around itwhich suggested a tsetsefly or something less innocuous an examination indicated that death must be due to heartfailure induced by sheer fright rather than to the bitethough a subsequent autopsy indicated that the germ of trypanosomiasis had been introduced into the systemon the table were several objectsa worn leather blankbook containing the journal just described a pen writingpad and open inkwell a doctors medicine case with the initials t s marked in gold bottles of ammonia and hydrochloric acid and a tumbler about a quarter full of black manganese dioxide the ammonia bottle demanded a second look because something besides the fluid seemed to be in it looking closer coroner bogaert saw that the alien occupant was a flyit seemed to be some sort of hybrid with vague tsetse affiliations but its wingsshewing faintly blue despite the action of the strong ammoniawere a complete puzzle something about it waked a faint memory of newspaper reading in dr van keulena memory which the journal was soon to confirm its lower parts seemed to have been stained with ink so thoroughly that even the ammonia had not bleached them possibly it had fallen at one time into the inkwell though the wings were untouched but how had it managed to fall into the narrownecked ammonia bottle it was as if the creature had deliberately crawled in and committed suicidebut the strangest thing of all was what constable de witt noticed on the smooth white ceiling overhead as his eyes roved about curiously at his cry the other three followed his gazeeven dr van keulen who had for some time been thumbing through the worn leather book with an expression of mixed horror fascination and incredulity the thing on the ceiling was a series of shaky straggling inktracks such as might have been made by the crawling of some inkdrenched insect at once everyone thought of the stains on the fly so oddly found in the ammonia bottlebut these were no ordinary inktracks even a first glance revealed something hauntingly familiar about them and closer inspection brought gasps of startled wonder from all four observers coroner bogaert instinctively looked around the room to see if there were any conceivable instrument or arrangement of piledup furniture which could make it possible for those straggling marks to have been drawn by human agency finding nothing of the sort he resumed his curious and almost awestruck upward glancefor beyond a doubt these inky smudges formed definite letters of the alphabetletters coherently arranged in english words the doctor was the first to make them out clearly and the others listened breathlessly as he recited the insanesounding message so incredibly scrawled in a place no human hand could reachsee my journalitgot me firsti diedthen i saw i was initthe blacks are rightstrange powers in naturenow i will drown what is leftpresently amidst the puzzled hush that followed dr van keulen commenced reading aloud from the worn leather journal,1
