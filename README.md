# Lovecraftian Entity Generator

## Overview
This project involves using H.P. Lovecraft's texts to create an entity generator based on deep learning techniques.
The goal is to generate Lovecraftian names and characteristics (such as appearance, origin, and behavior) based on the creatures, races, and deities described in Lovecraft's fiction.
The project combines text scraping, data analysis, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to create new, unique entities in the style of Lovecraft's world.

## Features
- **Scraping Lovecraft's Works**: Scrapes H.P. Lovecraft's writings from multiple sources (fiction, letters, poems, essays) using BeautifulSoup.
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies and extracts Lovecraftian entities, such as creatures, gods, and races, using Named Entity Recognition (NER) or pattern matching.
- **Data Preprocessing & Analysis**: Processes and cleans text data for machine learning, analyzes the frequency of entities, and organizes entity characteristics like appearance and origin.
- **Text Generation Model**: Fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-2) to generate new Lovecraftian entities based on the extracted data.
- **Exploration of Generated Entities**: Uses the trained model to generate new Lovecraftian names, descriptions, and origins, offering creative inspiration for potential stories or games.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lovecraftian-entity-generator.git
cd lovecraftian-entity-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Scraping Lovecraft Content
Scrape Lovecraft's works from websites like hplovecraft.com or Project Gutenberg.

```python
# Example code to scrape Lovecraft's fiction
from scraping_module import scrape_lovecraft_content
scrape_lovecraft_content('fiction')
```

### Entity Extraction
Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) or regular expressions to extract entities from the scraped text.

```python
# Example code to extract Lovecraftian entities from the text
from extraction_module import extract_entities
entities = extract_entities(lovecraft_text)
```

### Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the text for input into the language model.

```python
# Example code for text preprocessing
from preprocessing_module import preprocess_text
cleaned_data = preprocess_text(lovecraft_text)
```

### Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Model (GPT-2)
Use the cleaned and preprocessed data to fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model for generating Lovecraftian entities.

```python
# Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Lovecraftian data
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Prepare data for training
train_data = tokenizer(cleaned_data, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./gpt2_lovecraft", num_train_epochs=3)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=train_data)
trainer.train()
```

### Generate New Lovecraftian Entities
Generate new Lovecraftian names, characteristics, and descriptions based on the fine-tuned model.

```python
# Generate new Lovecraftian entities
input_prompt = "A new Lovecraftian entity: "
generated_text = model.generate(input_ids=tokenizer(input_prompt, return_tensors='pt').input_ids)
print(tokenizer.decode(generated_text[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Files

## Acknowledgements
- H.P. Lovecraft's works and the Lovecraft API were used for data collection.
- GPT-2 was used for text generation.

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune the model with more specific entity data for better accuracy in name generation.
- Expand the entity extraction to include characteristics like appearance, origin, and personality traits.
- Consider using advanced models like GPT-3 or fine-tuned GPT-Neo for even more sophisticated generation.
