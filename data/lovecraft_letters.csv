letters,"Letter to Clark Ashton Smith,27 November 1927By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft","Novr. 27Dear C A S:—I received both your letter & theOverlandwith
a great deal of pleasure.  I don’t yet know whether or not the latter is to be
returned—if it is, I can assure you that the copy remains safe & secure awaiting
instructions.  Sterling certainly proves his worth & fascination by the multitude of tributes
he continues to evoke—nearly all of them graceful, but your own standing out, to my mind, as
especially apt & distinguished.  I told you last year that your misgivings regarding its merit
were wholly unwarranted.  The portrait of Sterling surely has the atmosphere of
authenticity—not many poets are graced with such an appropriate & classical
physiognomy.Your Verlaine translation seems to me marvellously fresh, graceful, &
delicate, & I trust you will follow it with others from the same source.  I don’t know of
any good English version of Verlaine—that, as well as an English Baudelaire, would form a
task well worthy of your spare moments.  The French verses, in their amended versions, are now
doubtless up to the full standard of Galpininan accuracy—I’ll show them to Galpin the
next time I get in touch with him, & shall meanwhile be glad to see the others.  I’ve
come across a real Frenchman through correspondence lately—a bright young native of Southern
France named Jean Reçois, who now resides in New York & has aspirations toward fantastic
authorship in English.  I shall show him your French poetry shortly—& meanwhile you may
hear from him, since I’ve given him your address.You certainly ought to have a new volume by this time, & I cannot be too
emphatic in advising you to get in touch withW. Paul Cookabout it.  That is just the sort
of thing he is interested in at present—publishing small volumes of unusual merit &
unique distinction—& I am certain he would be willing to assume the financial risk, as he
did in the case of Loveman’s “Hermaphrodite”.  He is very reasonable about this
detail—if the author is able to bear the risk, well & good; but if not, he will do so
himself.  It is only in this way that he can ever publish my “Shunned House”, as he
keeps threatening to do.  Open up correspondence with him on the subject—I am really avid to
see something of yours published in a manner befitting its merit, a thing so far true only of your
“Star Treader” & “Odes & Sonnets”.  Cook can turn out a really fine
job when he tries—& I would guarantee to help with the proofreading myself.  I suppose
you are aware that he is now printing a book for Wandrei—of which I expect to see page-proofs
very shortly.Dwyer was as enthusiastic as all the rest concerning your pictures, as he has
probably informed you directly ere now.  Like me, he bitterly regrets his financial inability to
invest in some of them—especially the black & white “Dreamland”
illustrations, which also exercised a powerful imaginative influence over me.  He has now sent them
on to Long & the gang in N.Y., & I suppose Loveman will see that they reach the eye of De
Casseres.  You might drop him a line asking him not to overlook De C. or the Miss Turner you
mention—or I’ll do so myself, to save time.  Now my curiosity is sharpened by that
fresh sheet tacked to your drawing-board.  May I behold it ere long, made blasphemous by the
visions of daemoniac genius!I thought you’d findThe Recluserather enjoyable, & hope that
later issues will maintain the same standard.  Your prose-poem, as the first contribution to be
accepted, forms a favourable augury.  By the way—a correspondent tells me that a new
professional weird magazine has just been established—Tales of Magic & Mystery,edited by Walter Gibson, 931 Drexel Bldg., Philadelphia Pa.—& I’ve sent in a batch
of the stuff rejected by Wright.  You might try them with some poems or sketches—or
“The Abominations of Yondo”—& see what your luck is; though I don’t
know anything about the magazine, or even whether it is a present or future proposition.I’m not surprised that you’re discovering your indebtedness to the
Auburn landscape, for sooner or later we all learn that our thoughts & impressions are
basically reflections of what we have picked up visually & by long association at one time or
another.  I emphasised that point in the conclusion of one of those probably-never-to-be-typed
novelettes which I ground out last winter.  It’s all right to travel, but one needs the old
familiar scenes to come home to!  So far as I’m concerned, Providence with its mellow,
ancient life & skyline of old roofs & Georgian steeples will last me amply well for the
rest of my days.  It’s the mould that shaped me—& the space I most naturally fit
into.  Our autumn, unlike yours, has been phenomenally & genially warm; giving me an
opportunity for several rural excursions.  The northern & western parts of the state felt
something of the floods that hit N.E. early this month, but Providence was absolutely
untouched.I have had no chance to produce new material this autumn, but have been
classifying notes & synopses in preparation for some monstrous tales later on.  In particular I
have drawn up some data on the celebrated & unmentionableNecronomiconof the mad Arab
Abdul Alhazred!  It seems that this shocking blasphemy was produced by a native of Sanaá, in
Yemen, who flourished about 700 A.D. & made many mysterious pilgrimages to Babylon’s
ruins, Memphis’s catacombs, & the devil-haunted & untrodden wastes of the great
southern deserts of Arabia—the Roba el Khaliyeh, where he claimed to have found records of
things other than mankind, & to have learnt the worship of Yog-Sothoth & Cthulhu.  The book
was a product of Abdul’s old age, which was spent in Damascus, & the original title wasAl Azif—azif(cf. Henley’s notes to “Vathek”) being the name applied
to those strange night noises (of insects) which the Arabs attribute to the howling of daemons.
Alhazred died—or disappeared—under terrible circumstances in the year 738.  In 950Al Azifwas translated into Greek by the Byzantine Theodorus Philetas under the titleNecronomicon,& a century later it was burnt at the order of Michael, Patriarch of
Constantinople.  It was translated into Latin by Olaus in 1228, but placed on the “Index
Expurgatorius” by Pope Gregory IX in 1232.  The original Arabic was lost before Olaus’
time, & the lastknownGreek copy perished in Salem in 1692.  The work was printed in
the 15th, 16th, &
17thcenturies, but few copies are extant.  Wherever existing, it
is carefully guarded for the sake of the world’s welfare & sanity.  Once a man read
through the copy in the library of Miskatonic University at Arkham—read it through & fled
wild-eyed into the hills . . . . . . but that is another story!With best wishes from all the local afreets & djinns—Yr obtH P LP.S.  Heard a lecture by Sir Rennell Rodd last Monday on survivals of classic myth in modern Greek
folklore.  I was quite astonished—it seems that satyrs, nymphs, the Fates, Charon, &c.
are still believed in; & many of the old gods worshipped under thin saintly disguises.  Much of
the satyr folklore is of extreme weirdness—recalling Machen’s “little
people”."
