The Allowable RhymeBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"“Sed ubi plura
nitent in carmine, non ego paucisOffendar maculis.”—Horace.The poetical tendency of the present and of the preceding century has been divided in a manner
singularly curious. One loud and conspicuous faction of bards, giving way to the corrupt influences
of a decaying general culture, seems to have abandoned all the proprieties of versification
and reason in its mad scramble after sensational novelty; whilst the other and quieter school,
constituting a more logical evolution from the poesy of the Georgian period, demands an accuracy
of rhyme and metre unknown even to the polished artists of the age of Pope.The rational contemporary disciple of the Nine, justly ignoring the dissonant
shrieks of the radicals, is therefore confronted with a grave choice of technique. May he retain
the liberties of imperfect or “allowable” rhyming which were enjoyed by his ancestors,
or must he conform to the new ideals of perfection evolved during the past century? The writer
of this article is frankly an archaist in verse. He has not scrupled to rhyme “toss’d”
with “coast”, “come” with “Rome”, or “home”
with “gloom” in his very latest published efforts, thereby proclaiming his maintenance
of the old-fashioned poets as models; but sound modern criticism, proceeding from Mr. Rheinhart
Kleiner and from other sources which must needs command respect, has impelled him here to rehearse
the question for public benefit, and particularly to present his own side, attempting to justify
his adherence to the style of two centuries ago.The earliest English attempts at rhyming probably included words whose agreement
is so slight that it deserves the name of mere “assonance” rather than that of actual
rhyme. Thus in the original ballad of “Chevy-Chase”, we encounter “King”
and “within” supposedly rhymed, whilst in the similar “Battle of Otterbourne”
we behold “long” rhymed with “down”, “ground” with “Agurstonne”,
and “name” with “again”. In the ballad of “Sir Patrick Spense”,
“morn” and “storm”, and “deep” and “feet” are
rhymed. But the infelicities were obviously the result not of artistic negligence, but of plebeian
ignorance, since the old ballads were undoubtedly the careless products of a peasant minstrelsy.
In Chaucer, a poet of the Court, the allowable rhyme is but infrequently discovered, hence we
may assume that the original ideal in English verse was the perfect rhyming sound.Spenser uses allowable rhymes, giving in one of his characteristic stanzas
the three distinct sounds of “Lord”, “ador’d”, and “word”,
all supposed to rhyme; but of his pronunciation we know little, and may justly guess that to
the ears of his contemporaries the sounds were not conspicuously different. Ben Jonson’s
employment of imperfect rhyming was much like Spenser’s; moderate, and partially to be
excused on account of a chaotic pronunciation. The better poets of the Restoration were also
sparing of allowable rhymes; Cowley, Waller, Marvell, and many others being quite regular in
this respect.It was therefore upon a world unprepared that Samuel Butler burst forth with
his immortal “Hudibras”, whose comical familiarity of diction is in grotesqueness
surpassed only by its clever licentiousness of rhyming. Butler’s well-known double rhymes
are of necessity forced and inexact, and in ordinary single rhymes he seems to have had no more
regard for precision. “Vow’d” and “would”, “talisman”
and “slain”, “restores” and “devours” are a few specimens
selected at random.Close after Butler came John Oldham, a satirist whose force and brilliancy
gained him universal praise, and whose enormous crudity both in rhyme and in metre was forgotten
amidst the splendour of his attacks. Oldham was almost absolutely ungoverned by the demands
of the ear, and perpetrated such atrocious rhymes as “heads” and “besides”,
“devise” and “this”, “again” and “sin”, “tool”
and “foul”, “end” and “design’d”, and even “prays”
and “cause”.The glorious Dryden, refiner and purifier of English verse, did less for rhyme
than he did for metre. Though nowhere attaining the extravagances of his friend Oldham, he lent
the sanction of his great authority to rhymes which Dr. Johnson admits are “open to objection”.
But one vast difference betwixt Dryden and his loose predecessors must be observed. Dryden had
so far improved metrical cadence, that the final syllables of heroic couplets stood out in especial
eminence, displaying and emphasising every possible similarity of sound; that is, lending to
sounds in the first place approximately similar, the added similarity caused by the new prominence
of their perfectly corresponding positions in their respective lines.It were needless to dwell upon the rhetorical polish of the age immediately
succeeding Dryden’s. So far as English versification is concerned, Pope was the world,
and all the world was Pope. Dryden had founded a new school of verse, but the development and
ultimate perfection of this art remained for the sickly lad who before the age of twelve begged
to be taken to Will’s Coffee-House, that he might obtain one personal view of the aged
Dryden, his idol and model. Delicately attuned to the subtlest harmonies of poetical construction,
Alexander Pope brought English prosody to its zenith, and still stands alone on the heights.
Yet he, exquisite master of verse that he was, frowned not upon imperfect rhymes, provided they
were set in faultless metre. Though most of his allowable rhymes are merely variations in the
breadth and nature of vowel sounds, he in one instance departs far enough from rigid perfection
to rhyme the words “vice” and “destroys”. Yet who can take offence?
The unvarying ebb and flow of the refined metrical impulse conceals and condones all else.Every argument by which English blank verse or Spanish assonant verse is sustained,
may with greater force be applied to the allowable rhyme. Metre is the real essential of poetical
technique, and when two sounds of substantial resemblance are so placed that one follows the
other in a certain measured relation, the normal ear cannot without cavilling find fault with
a slight want of identity in the respective dominant vowels. The rhyming of a long vowel with
a short one is common in all the Georgian poets, and when well recited cannot but be overlooked
amidst the general flow of the verse; as, for instance, the following from Pope:“But thinks, admitted to that equal SKY,His faithful dog shall bear him COMPANY.”Of like nature is the rhyming of actually different vowels whose sounds are, when pronounced
in animated oration, by no means dissimilar. Out of verse, such words as “join”
and “line” are quite unlike, but Pope well rhymes them when he writes:“While expletives their feeble aid do JOIN,And ten low words oft creep in one dull LINE.”It is the final consonantal sound in rhyming which can never vary. This, above
all else, gives the desired similarity. Syllables which agree in vowels but not in final consonants
are not rhymes at all, but simply assonants. Yet such is the inconsistent carelessness of the
average modern writer, that he often uses these mere assonants to a greater extent than his
fathers ever employed actually allowable rhymes. The writer, in his critical duties, has more
than once been forced to point out the attempted rhyming of such words as “fame”
and “lane”, “task” and “glass”, or “feels” and
“yields”, and in view of these impossible combinations he cannot blame himself very
seriously for rhyming “art” and “shot” in the MarchConservative;for this pair of words have at least identical consonants at the end.That allowable rhymes have real advantages of a positive sort is an opinion
by no means lightly to be denied. The monotony of a long heroic poem may often be pleasantly
relieved by judicious interruptions in the perfect succession of rhymes, just as the metre may
sometimes be adorned with occasional triplets and Alexandrines. Another advantage is the greater
latitude allowed for the expression of thought. How numerous are the writers who, from restriction
to perfect rhyming, are frequently compelled to abandon a neat epigram or brilliant antithesis,
which allowable rhyme would easily permit, or else to introduce a dull expletive merely to supply
a desired rhyme!But a return to historical considerations shews us only too clearly the logical
trend of taste, and the reason Mr. Kleiner’s demand for absolute perfection is no idle
cry. In Oliver Goldsmith there arose one who, though retaining the familiar classical diction
of Pope, yet advanced further still toward what he deemed ideal polish by virtually abandoning
the allowable rhyme. In unvaried exactitude run the couplets of “The Traveller”
and of “The Deserted Village”, and none can deny to them a certain urbanity which
pleases the critical ear. With but little less precision are moulded the simple rhymes of Cowper,
whilst the pompous Erasmus Darwin likewise shews more attention to identity of sound than do
the Queen Anne bards. Gifford’s translations of Juvenal and Persius shew to an almost
equal degree the tendency of the age, and Campbell, Crabbe, Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, and Thomas
Moore are all inclined to refrain from the liberties practiced by those of former times. To
deny the importance of such a widespread change of technique is fruitless, for its existence
argues for its naturalness. The best critics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demand
perfect rhyming, and no aspirant for fame can afford to depart from a standard so universal.
It is evidently the true goal of the English, as well as of the French bard; the goal from which
we were but temporarily deflected during the preceding age.But exceptions should and must be made in the case of a few who have somehow
absorbed the atmosphere of other days, and who long in their hearts for the stately sound of
the old classic cadences. Well may their predilection for imperfect rhyming be discouraged to
a limited extent, but to chain them wholly to modern rules would be barbarous. Every individual
mind demands a certain freedom of expression, and the man who cannot express himself satisfactorily
without the stimulation derived from the spirited mode of two centuries ago should certainly
be permitted to follow without undue restraint a practice at once so harmless, so free from
essential error, and so sanctioned by precedent, as that of employing in his poetical compositions
the smooth and inoffensive allowable rhyme."
At the RootBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"To those who look beneath the surface, the present universal war drives home more than one anthropological
truth in striking fashion; and of these verities none is more profound than that relating to
the essential immutability of mankind and its instincts.Four years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under certain biological
fallacies which may, in a sense, be held responsible for the extent and duration of the present
conflict. These fallacies, which were the foundation of pacifism and other pernicious forms
of social and political radicalism, dealt with the capability of man to evolve mentally beyond
his former state of subservience to primitive instinct and pugnacity, and to conduct his affairs
and international or inter-racial relations on a basis of reason and good-will. That belief
in such capability is unscientific and childishly naive, is beside the question. The fact remains,
that the most civilised part of the world, including our own Anglo-Saxondom, did entertain enough
of these notions to relax military vigilance, lay stress on points of honour, place trust in
treaties, and permit a powerful and unscrupulous nation to indulge unchecked and unsuspected
in nearly fifty years of preparation for world-wide robbery and slaughter. We are reaping the
result of our simplicity.The past is over. Our former follies we can but regret, and expiate as best
we may by a crusade to the death against the Trans-Rhenane monster which we allowed to grow
and flourish beneath our very eyes. But the future holds more of responsibility, and we must
prepare to guard against any renascence of the benevolent delusions that four years of blood
have barely been able to dispel. In a word, we must learn to discard forever the sentimental
standpoint, and to view our species through the cold eyes of science alone. We must recognise
the essential underlying savagery in the animal called man, and return to older and sounder
principles of national life and defence. We must realise that man’s nature will remain
the same so long as he remains man; that civilisation is but a slight coverlet beneath which
the dominant beast sleeps lightly and ever ready to awake. To preserve civilisation, we must
deal scientifically with the brute element, using only genuine biological principles. In considering
ourselves, we think too much of ethics and sociology—too little of plain natural history.
We should perceive that man’s period of historical existence, a period so short that his
physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest degree, is insufficient to allow
of any considerable mental change. The instincts that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians
of old, govern us as well; and as the ancients thought, grasped, struggled, and deceived, so
shall we moderns continue to think, grasp, struggle, and deceive in our inmost hearts. Change
is only superficial and apparent.Man’s respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental constitution
and environment. Through certain modes of thought and training it can be elevated tremendously,
yet there is always a limit. The man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths
the restraints imposed by conventions and honour, but beyond a certain point primitive will
or desire cannot be curbed. Denied anything ardently desired, the individual or state will argue
and parley just so long—then, if the impelling motive be sufficiently great, will cast
aside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition, plunging viciously after the object
wished; all the more fantastically savage because of previous repression.The sole ultimate
factor in human decisions is physical force.This we must learn, however repugnant the idea
may seem, if we are to protect ourselves and our institutions. Reliance on anything else is
fallacious and ruinous. Dangerous beyond description are the voices sometimes heard today, decrying
the continuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities.The specific application of the scientific truth regarding man’s native
instincts will be found in the adoption of a post-bellum international programme. Obviously,
we must take into account the primordial sub-structure and arrange for the upholding of culture
by methods which will stand the acid test of stress and conflicting ambitions. In disillusioned
diplomacy, ample armament, and universal training alone will be found the solution of the world’s
difficulties. It will not be a perfect solution, because humanity is not perfect. It will not
abolish war, because war is the expression of a natural human tendency. But it will at least
produce an approximate stability of social and political conditions, and prevent the menace
of the entire world by the greed of any one of its constituent parts."
Cats and DogsBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Being told of the cat-and-dog fight about to occur in the Blue Pencil Club—a
new thing for your circle, perhaps, though not unfamiliar to amateurdom as a whole—I cannot
resist contributing a few Thomasic yowls and sibilants upon my side of the dispute, though conscious
that the word of a venerable ex-member can scarcely have much weight against the brilliancy
of such still active adherents as may bark upon the other side. Aware of my ineptitude at argument,
my valued correspondent Curator James Ferdinand Morton of Paterson has sent me the records of
a similar controversy in theNew York Tribune,in which Mr. Carl Van Doren is on my side
and Mr. Albert Payson Terhune on that of the canine tribe. From this I would be glad to plagiarise
such data as I need; but Mr. Morton, with genuinely Machiavellian subtlety, has furnished me
with only a part of the feline section whilst submitting the doggish brief in full. No doubt
he imagines that this arrangement, in view of my own emphatic bias, makes for something like
ultimate fairness; but for me it is exceedingly inconvenient, since it will force me to be more
or less original in several parts of the ensuing remarks.Between dogs and cats my degree of choice is so great that it would never occur
to me to compare the two. I have no active dislike for dogs, any more than I have for monkeys,
human beings, negroes, cows, sheep, or pterodactyls; but for the cat I have entertained a particular
respect and affection ever since the earliest days of my infancy. In its flawless grace and
superior self-sufficiency I have seen a symbol of the perfect beauty and bland impersonality
of the universe itself, objectively considered; and in its air of silent mystery there resides
for me all the wonder and fascination of the unknown. The dog appeals to cheap and facile emotions;
the cat to the deepest founts of imagination and cosmic perception in the human mind. It is
no accident that the contemplative Egyptians, together with such later poetic spirits as Poe,
Gautier, Baudelaire, and Swinburne, were all sincere worshippers of the supple grimalkin.Naturally, one’s preference in the matter of cats and dogs depends wholly
upon one’s temperament and point of view. The dog would appear to me to be the favourite
of superficial, sentimental, emotional, and democratic people—people who feel rather than
think, who attach importance to mankind and the popular conventional emotions of the simple,
and who find their greatest consolation in the fawning and dependent attachments of a gregarious
society. Such people live in a limited world of imagination; accepting uncritically the values
of common folklore, and always preferring to have their naive beliefs, feelings, and prejudices
tickled, rather than to enjoy a purely aesthetic and philosophic pleasure arising from discrimination,
contemplation, and the recognition of austere absolute beauty. This is not to say that the cheaper
emotions do not also reside in the average cat-lover’s love of cats, but merely to point
out that in ailurophily there exists a basis of true aestheticism which kynophily does not possess.
The real lover of cats is one who demands a clearer adjustment to the universe than ordinary
household platitudes provide; one who refuses to swallow the sentimental notion that all good
people love dogs, children, and horses while all bad people dislike and are disliked by such.
He is unwilling to set up himself and his cruder feelings as a measure of universal values,
or to allow shallow ethical notions to warp his judgment. In a word, he had rather admire and
respect than effuse and dote; and does not fall into the fallacy that pointless sociability
and friendliness, or slavering devotion and obedience, constitute anything intrinsically admirable
or exalted. Dog-lovers base their whole case on these commonplace, servile, and plebeian qualities,
and amusingly judge the intelligence of a pet by its degree of conformity to their own wishes.
Catlovers escape this delusion, repudiate the idea that cringing subservience and sidling companionship
to man are supreme merits, and stand free to worship aristocratic independence, self-respect,
and individual personality joined to extreme grace and beauty as typified by the cool, lithe,
cynical, and unconquered lord of the housetops.Persons of commonplace ideas—unimaginative worthy burghers who are satisfied
with the daily round of things and who subscribe to the popular credo of sentimental values—will
always be dog-lovers. To them nothing will ever be more important than themselves and their
own more primitive feelings, and they will never cease to esteem and glorify the fellow-animal
who best typifies these. Such persons are submerged in the vortex of Oriental idealism and abasement
which ruined classic civilisation in the Dark Ages, and live in a bleak world of abstract sentimental
values wherein the mawkish illusions of meekness, devotion, gentleness, brotherhood, and whining
humility are magnified into supreme virtues, and a whole false ethic and philosophy erected
on the timid reactions of the flexor system of muscles. This heritage, ironically foisted on
us when Roman politics raised the faith of a whipped and broken people to supremacy in the later
empire, has naturally kept a strong hold over the weak and the sentimentally thoughtless; and
perhaps reached its culmination in the insipid nineteenth century, when people were wont to
praise dogs “because they are so human” (as if humanity were any valid standard
of merit!), and honest Edwin Landseer painted hundreds of smug Fidoes and Carlos and Rovers
with all the anthropoid triviality, pettiness, and “cuteness” of eminent Victorians.But amidst this chaos of intellectual and emotional grovelling a few free souls
have always stood out for the old civilised realities which mediaevalism eclipsed—the
stern classic loyalty to truth, strength, and beauty given by a clear mind and uncowed spirit
to the full-living Western Aryan confronted by Nature’s majesty, loveliness, and aloofness.
This is the virile aesthetic and ethic of the extensor muscles—the bold, buoyant, assertive
beliefs and preferences of proud, dominant, unbroken, and unterrified conquerors, hunters, and
warriors—and it has small use for the shams and whimperings of the brotherly, affection-slobbering
peacemaker and cringer and sentimentalist. Beauty and sufficiency—twin qualities of the
cosmos itself—are the gods of this aristocratic and pagan type; to the worshipper of such
eternal things the supreme virtue will not be found in lowliness, attachment, obedience, and
emotional messiness. This sort of worshipper will look for that which best embodies the loveliness
of the stars and the worlds and the forests and the seas and the sunsets, and which best acts
out the blandness, lordliness, accuracy, self-sufficiency, cruelty, independence, and contemptuous
and capricious impersonality of all-governing Nature. Beauty—coolness—aloofness—philosophic
repose—self-sufficiency—untamed mastery—where else can we find these things
incarnated with even half the perfection and completeness that mark their incarnation in the
peerless and softly gliding cat, which performs its mysterious orbit with the relentless and
unobtrusive certainty of a planet in infinity?That dogs are dear to the unimaginative peasant-burgher whilst cats appeal
to the sensitive poet-aristocrat-philosopher will be clear in a moment when we reflect on the
matter of biological association. Practical plebeian folk judge a thing only by its immediate
touch, taste, and smell; while more delicate types form their estimates from the linked images
and ideas which the object calls up in their minds. Now when dogs and cats are considered, the
stolid churl sees only the two animals before him, and bases his favour on their relative capacity
to pander to his sloppy, unformed ideas of ethics and friendship and flattering subservience.
On the other hand the gentleman and thinker sees each in all its natural affiliations, and cannot
fail to notice that in the great symmetries of organic life dogs fall in with slovenly wolves
and foxes and jackals and coyotes and dingoes and painted hyaenas, whilst cats walk proudly
with the jungle’s lords, and own the haughty lion, the sinuous leopard, the regal tiger,
and the shapely panther and jaguar as their kin. Dogs are the hieroglyphs of blind emotion,
inferiority, servile attachment, and gregariousness—the attributes of commonplace, stupidly
passionate, and intellectually and imaginatively undeveloped men. Cats are the runes of beauty,
invincibility, wonder, pride, freedom, coldness, self-sufficiency, and dainty individuality—the
qualities of sensitive, enlightened, mentally developed, pagan, cynical, poetic, philosophic,
dispassionate, reserved, independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master-class men. The
dog is a peasant and the cat is a gentleman.We may, indeed, judge the tone and bias of a civilisation by its relative attitude
toward dogs and cats. The proud Egypt wherein Pharaoh was Pharaoh and pyramids rose in beauty
at the wish of him who dreamed them bowed down to the cat, and temples were builded to its goddess
at Bubastis. In imperial Rome the graceful leopard adorned most homes of quality, lounging in
insolent beauty in the atrium with golden collar and chain; while after the age of the Antonines
the actual cat was imported from Egypt and cherished as a rare and costly luxury. So much for
dominant and enlightened peoples. When, however, we come to the grovelling Middle Ages with
their superstitions and ecstasies and monasticisms and maunderings over saints and their relics,
we find the cool and impersonal loveliness of the felidae in very low esteem; and behold a sorry
spectacle of hatred and cruelty shewn toward the beautiful little creature whose mousing virtues
alone gained it sufferance amongst the ignorant churls who resented its self-respecting coolness
and feared its cryptical and elusive independence as something akin to the dark powers of witchcraft.
These boorish slaves of eastern darkness could not tolerate what did not serve their own cheap
emotions and flimsy purposes. They wished a dog to fawn and hunt and fetch and carry, and had
no use for the cat’s gift of eternal and disinterested beauty to feed the spirit. One
can imagine how they must have resented Pussy’s magnificent reposefulness, unhurriedness,
relaxation, and scorn for trivial human aims and concernments. Throw a stick, and the servile
dog wheezes and pants and shambles to bring it to you. Do the same before a cat, and he will
eye you with coolly polite and somewhat bored amusement. And just as inferior people prefer
the inferior animal which scampers excitedly because somebody else wants something, so do superior
people respect the superior animal which lives its own life and knows that the puerile stick-throwings
of alien bipeds are none of its business and beneath its notice. The dog barks and begs and
tumbles to amuse you when you crack the whip. That pleases a meekness-loving peasant who relishes
a stimulus to his sense of importance. The cat, on the other hand, charms you into playing for
its benefit when it wishes to be amused; making you rush about the room with a paper on a string
when it feels like exercise, but refusing all your attempts to make it play when it is not in
the humour. That is personality and individuality and self-respect—the calm mastery of
a being whose life is its own and not yours—and the superior person recognises and appreciates
this because he too is a free soul whose position is assured, and whose only law is his own
heritage and aesthetic sense. Altogether, we may see that the dog appeals to those primitive
emotional souls whose chief demands on the universe are for meaningless affection, aimless companionship,
and flattering attention and subservience; whilst the cat reigns among those more contemplative
and imaginative spirits who ask of the universe only the objective sight of poignant, ethereal
beauty and the animate symbolisation of Nature’s bland, relentless, reposeful, unhurried,
and impersonal order and sufficiency. The doggives,but the catis.Simple folk always overstress the ethical element in life, and it is quite
natural that they should extend it to the realm of their pets. Accordingly we hear many inane
dicta in favour of dogs on the ground that they arefaithful,whilst cats aretreacherous.Now just what does this really mean? Where are the points of reference? Certainly, the dog has
so little imagination and individuality that it knows no motives but its master’s; but
what sophisticated mind can descry a positive virtue in this stupid abnegation of a birthright?
Discrimination must surely award the palm to the superior cat, which has too much natural dignity
to accept any scheme of things but its own, and which consequently cares not one whit what any
clumsy human thinks or wishes or expects of it. It is nottreacherous,because it has
never acknowledged any allegiance to anything outside its own leisurely wishes; andtreacherybasically implies a departure from some covenant explicitly recognised. The cat is a realist,
and no hypocrite. He takes what pleases him when he wants it, and makes no promises. He never
leads you to expect more from him than he gives, and if you choose to be stupidly Victorian
enough to mistake his purrs and rubbings of self-satisfaction for marks of transient affection
toward you, that is no fault of his. He would not for a moment have you believe that he wants
more of you than food and warmth and shelter and amusement—and he is certainly justified
in criticising your aesthetic and imaginative development if you fail to find his grace, beauty,
and cheerful decorative influence an aboundingly sufficient repayment for all that you give
him. The cat-lover need not be amazed at another’s love for dogs—indeed, he may
also possess this quality himself; for dogs are often very comely, and as lovable in a condescending
way as a faithful old servant or tenant in the eyes of a master—but he cannot help feeling
astonishment at those who do not share his love for cats. The cat is such a perfect symbol of
beauty and superiority that it seems scarcely possible for any true aesthete and civilised cynic
to do other than worship it. We call ourselves a dog’s “master”—but
who ever dared to call himself the “master” of a cat? Weowna dog—he
is with us as a slave and inferior because we wish him to be. But weentertaina cat—he
adorns our hearth as a guest, fellow-lodger, and equal becausehewishes to be there.
It is no compliment to be the stupidly idolised master of a dog whose instinct it is to idolise,
but it is a very distinct tribute to be chosen as the friend and confidant of a philosophic
cat who is wholly his own master and could easily choose another companion if he found such
an one more agreeable and interesting. A trace, I think, of this great truth regarding the higher
dignity of the cat has crept into folklore in the use of the names “cat” and “dog”
as terms of opprobrium. Whilst “cat” has never been applied to any sort of offender
more serious than the mildly spiteful and innocuously sly female gossip and commentator, the
words “dog” and “cur” have always been linked with vileness, dishonour,
and degradation of the gravest type. In the crystallisation of this nomenclature there has undoubtedly
been present in the popular mind some dim, half-unconscious realisation that there are depths
of slinking, whining, fawning, and servile ignobility which no kith of the lion and the leopard
could ever attain. The cat may fall low, but he is always unbroken. He is, like the Nordic among
men, one of those who govern their own lives or die.We have but to glance analytically at the two animals to see the points pile
up in favour of the cat. Beauty, which is probably the only thing of any basic significance
in all the cosmos, ought to be our chief criterion; and here the cat excels so brilliantly that
all comparisons collapse. Some dogs, it is true, have beauty in a very ample degree; but even
the highest level of canine beauty falls far below the feline average. The cat is classic whilst
the dog is Gothic—nowhere in the animal world can we discover such really Hellenic perfection
of form, with anatomy adapted to function, as in the felidae. Puss is a Doric temple—an
Ionic colonnade—in the utter classicism of its structural and decorative harmonies. And
this is just as true kinetically as statically, for art has no parallel for the bewitching grace
of the cat’s slightest motion. The sheer, perfect aestheticism of kitty’s lazy stretchings,
industrious face-washings, playful rollings, and little involuntary shiftings in sleep is something
as keen and vital as the best pastoral poetry or genre painting; whilst the unerring accuracy
of his leaping and springing, running and hunting, has an art-value just as high in a more spirited
way. But it is his capacity for leisure and repose which makes the cat preëminent. Mr.
Carl Van Vechten, in “Peter Whiffle”, holds up the timeless restfulness of the cat
as a model for a life’s philosophy, and Prof. William Lyon Phelps has very effectively
captured the secret of felinity when he says that the cat does not merelylie down,but“pours his body out on the floor like a glass of water”.What other creature
has thus merged the aestheticism of mechanics and hydraulics? Contrast with this the inept panting,
wheezing, fumbling, drooling, scratching, and general clumsiness of the average dog with his
myriad false and wasted motions. And in the detail of neatness the fastidious cat is of course
immeasurably ahead. We always love to touch a cat, but only the insensitive can uniformly welcome
the frantic and humid nuzzlings and pawings of a dusty and perhaps not inodorous canine which
leaps and fusses and writhes about in awkward feverishness for no particular reason save that
blind nerve-centres have been spurred by certain meaningless stimuli. There is a wearying excess
of bad manners in all this doggish fury—well-bred people don’t paw and maul one,
and surely enough we invariably find the cat gentle and reserved in his advances, and delicate
even when he glides gracefully into your lap with cultivated purrs, or leaps whimsically on
the table where you are writing to play with your pen in modulated, serio-comic pats. I do not
wonder that Mahomet, that sheik of perfect manners, loved cats for their urbanity and disliked
dogs for their boorishness; or that cats are the favourites in the polite Latin countries whilst
dogs take the lead in heavy, practical, and beer-drinking Central Europe. Watch a cat eat, and
then watch a dog. The one is held in check by an inherent and inescapable daintiness, and lends
a kind of grace to one of the most ungraceful of all processes. The dog, on the other hand,
is wholly repulsive in his bestial and insatiate greediness; living up to his forest kinship
by “wolfing” most openly and unashamedly. Returning to beauty of line—is it
not significant that while many normal breeds of dogs are conspicuously and admittedly ugly,nohealthy and well-developed feline of any species whatsoever is other than beautiful?
There are, of course, many ugly cats; but these are always individual cases of mongrelism, malnutrition,
deformity, or injury. No breed of cats in its proper condition can by any stretch of the imagination
be thought of as even slightly ungraceful—a record against which must be pitted the depressing
spectacle of impossibly flattened bulldogs, grotesquely elongated dachshunds, hideously shapeless
and shaggy Airedales, and the like. Of course, it may be said that no aesthetic standard is
other than relative—but we always work with such standards as we empirically have, and
in comparing cats and dogs under the Western European aesthetic we cannot be unfair to either.
If any undiscovered tribe in Thibet finds Airedales beautiful and Persian cats ugly, we will
not dispute them on their own territory—but just now we are dealing with ourselves and
our territory, and here the verdict would not admit of much doubt even from the most ardent
kynophile. Such an one usually passes the problem off in an epigrammatic paradox, and says ‘that
Snookums is so homely, he’s pretty!’ This is the childish penchant for the grotesque
and tawdrily ‘cute’, which we see likewise embodied in popular cartoons, freak dolls,
and all the malformed decorative trumpery of the “Billiken” or “Krazy Kat”
order found in the “dens” and “cosy corners” of the would-be sophisticated
cultural yokelry.In the matter of intelligence we find the caninites making amusing claims—amusing
because they so naively measure what they conceive to be an animal’s intelligence by its
degree of subservience to the human will. A dog will retrieve, a cat will not;therefore(sic!) the dog is the more intelligent. Dogs can be more elaborately trained for circus and
vaudeville acts than cats,therefore(O Zeus, O Royal Mount!) they are cerebrally superior.
Now of course this is all the sheerest nonsense. We would not call a weak-spirited man more
intelligent than an independent citizen because we can make him vote as we wish whereas we can’t
influence the independent citizen, yet countless persons apply an exactly parallel argument
in appraising the grey matter of dogs and cats. Competition in servility is something to which
no self-respecting Thomas or Tabitha ever stooped, and it is plain that any really effective
estimate of canine and feline intelligence must proceed from a careful observation of dogs and
cats in a detached state—uninfluenced by human beings—as they formulate certain
objectives of their own and use their own mental equipment in achieving them. When we do this,
we arrive at a very wholesome respect for our purring hearthside friend who makes so little
display and ado about his wishes and business methods; for in every conception and calculation
he shews a steel-cold and deliberate union of intellect, will, and sense of proportion which
puts utterly to shame the emotional sloppings-over and docilely acquired artificial tricks of
the “clever” and “faithful” pointer or sheep-dog. Watch a cat decide
to move through a door, and see how patiently he waits for his opportunity, never losing sight
of his purpose even when he finds it expedient to feign other interests in the interim. Watch
him in the thick of the chase, and compare his calculating patience and quiet study of his terrain
with the noisy floundering and pawing of his canine rival. It is not often that he returns empty-handed.
He knows what he wants, and means to get it in the most effective way, even at the sacrifice
of time—which he philosophically recognises as unimportant in the aimless cosmos. There
is no turning him aside or distracting his attention—and we know that among humans this
very quality of mental tenacity, this ability to carry a single thread through complex distractions,
is considered a pretty good sign of intellectual vigour and maturity. Children, old crones,
peasants, and dogs ramble; cats and philosophers stick to their point. In resourcefulness, too,
the cat attests his superiority. Dogs can be well trained to do a single thing, but psychologists
tell us that these responses to an automatic memory instilled from outside are of little worth
as indices of real intelligence. To judge the abstract development of a brain, confront it with
new and unfamiliar conditions and see how well its own strength enables it to achieve its object
by sheer reasoning without blazed trails. Here the cat can silently devise a dozen mysterious
and successful alternatives whilst poor Fido is barking in bewilderment and wondering what it
is all about. Granted that Rover the retriever may make a greater bid for popular sentimental
regard by going into the burning house and saving the baby in traditional cinema fashion, it
remains a fact that whiskered and purring Nig is a higher-grade biological organism—something
physiologically and psychologically nearer a man because of his very freedom from man’s
orders, and as such entitled to a higher respect from those who judge by purely philosophic
and aesthetic standards. We can respect a cat as we cannot respect a dog, no matter which personally
appeals the more to our mere doting fancy; and if we be aesthetes and analysts rather than
commonplace-lovers and emotionalists, the scales must inevitably turn completely in kitty’s
favour. It may be added, moreover, that even the aloof and sufficient cat is by no means devoid of
sentimental appeal. Once we get rid of the uncivilised ethical bias—the ‘treacherous’
and ‘horrid bird-catcher’ prejudice—we find in the ‘harmless, necessary
cat’ the very apex of happy domestic symbolism; whilst small kittens become objects to
adore, idealise, and celebrate in the most rhapsodic of dactyls and anapaests, iambics and trochaics.
I, in my own senescent mellowness, confess to an inordinate and wholly unphilosophic predilection
for tiny coal-black kitties with large yellow eyes, and could no more pass one without petting
him than Dr. Johnson could pass a sidewalk post without striking it. There is, likewise, in
many cats something quite analogous to the reciprocal fondness so loudly extolled in dogs, human
beings, horses, and the like. Cats come to associate certain persons with acts continuously
contributing to their pleasure, and acquire for them a recognition and attachment which manifests
itself in pleasant excitement at their approach—whether or not bearing food and drink—and
a certain pensiveness at their protracted absence. The late “Tat” of Allston and
Malden, grey companion of our fellow-amateur Mrs. Miniter, reached the point of accepting food
from no other hand but hers, and would actually go hungry rather than touch the least morsel
from a kindly Parker source. He also had distinct affections amongst the other cats of that
idyllic household; voluntarily offering food to one of his whiskered friends, whilst disputing
most savagely the least glance which his coal-black rival “Snowball” would bestow
upon his plate. If it be argued that these feline fondnesses are essentially ‘selfish’
and ‘practical’ in their ultimate composition, let us inquire in return how many
human fondnesses, apart from those springing directly upon primitive brute instinct, have any
other basis. After the returning board has brought in the grand total of zero we shall be better
able to refrain from ingenuous censure of the ‘selfish’ cat.The superior imaginative inner life of the cat, resulting in superior self-possession,
is well known. A dog is a pitiful thing, depending wholly on companionship, and utterly lost
except in packs or by the side of his master. Leave him alone and he does not know what to do
except bark and howl and trot about till sheer exhaustion forces him to sleep. A cat, however,
is never without the potentialities of contentment. Like a superior man, he knows how to be
alone and happy. Once he looks about and finds no one to amuse him, he settles down to the task
of amusing himself; and no one really knows cats without having occasionally peeked stealthily
at some lively and well-balanced kitten which believes itself to be alone. Only after such a
glimpse of unaffected tail-chasing grace and unstudied purring can one fully understand the
charm of those lines which Coleridge wrote with reference to the human rather than the feline
young“. . . a limber elf,Singing, dancing to
itself.”But whole volumes could be written on the playing of cats, since the varieties and aesthetic
aspects of such sportiveness are infinite. Be it sufficient to say that in such pastimes many
cats have exhibited traits and actions which psychologists authentically declare to be motivated
by genuine humour and whimsicality in its purest sense; so that the task of ‘making a
cat laugh’ may not be so impossible a thing even outside the borders of Cheshire. In short,
a dog is an incomplete thing. Like an inferior man, he needs emotional stimuli from outside,
and must set something artificial up as a god and motive. The cat, however, is perfect in himself.
Like the human philosopher, he is a self-sufficient entity and microcosm. He is a real and integrated
being because he thinks and feels himself to be such, whereas the dog can conceive of himself
only in relation to something else. Whip a dog and he licks your hand—faugh! The beast
has no idea of himself except as an inferior part of an organism whereof you are a superior
part—he would no more think of striking back at you than you would think of pounding your
own head when it punishes you with a headache. But whip a cat and watch it glare and move backward
hissing in outraged dignity and self-respect! One more blow, and it strikes you in return; for
it is a gentleman and your equal, and will accept no infringement on its personality and body
of privileges. It is only in your house anyway because it wishes to be, or perhaps even as a
condescending favour to yourself. It is the house, not you, it likes; for philosophers realise
that human beings are at best only minor adjuncts to scenery. Go one step too far, and it leaves
you altogether. You have mistaken your relationship to it and imagined you are its master, and
no real cat can tolerate that breach of good manners. Henceforward it will seek companions of
greater discrimination and clearer perspective. Let anaemic persons who believe in ‘turning
the other cheek’ console themselves with cringing dogs—for the robust pagan with
the blood of Nordic twilights in his veins there is no beast like the cat; intrepid steed of
Freya, who can boldly look even Thor and Odin full in the face and stare contemplatively with
great round eyes of undimmed yellow or green.And so, Sir (I employ the singular since I cannot imagine that you, O Jacobe
Ferdinande, would have the truly feline cruelty to spring all these ten-plus pages on a deserving
club which has never done you any harm), I believe I have outlined for you with some fulness
the divers reasons why, in my opinion and in the smartly timed title-phrase of Mr. Van Doren,
“gentlemen prefer cats”. The reply of Mr. Terhune in a subsequent issue of theTribuneappears to me beside the point; insomuch as it is less a refutation of facts than
a mere personal affirmation of the author’s membership in that conventional “very
human” majority who take affection and companionship seriously, enjoy being important
to something alive, measure merit by devotion to human purposes, hate a “parasite”
on mere ethical grounds without consulting the right of beauty to exist for its own sake, and
therefore love man’s noblest and most faithful friend, the perennial dog. I suppose Mr.
Terhune loves horses and babies also, for they go conventionally together in the great hundred-per-center’s
credo as highly essential likings for every good and lovable heman of the Arrow Collar and Harold
Bell Wright hero school, even though the motor car and dear Mrs. Sanger have done much to reduce
the last two items.Dogs, then, are peasants and the pets of peasants; cats are gentlemen and the
pets of gentlemen. The dog is for him who places crude feeling and outgrown ethics and humanocentricity
above austere and disinterested beauty; who just loves ‘folks and folksiness’ and
doesn’t mind sloppy clumsiness if only something will truly care for him. (Tableau of
dog across master’s grave—cf. Landseer, “The Old Shepherd’s Chief Mourner”.)
The guy who isn’t much for highbrow stuff, but is always on the square and don’t
(sic) often find the Saddypost or the N.Y. World too deep for him; who hadn’t much use
for Valentino, but thinks Doug Fairbanks is just about right for an evening’s entertainment.
Wholesome—constructive—non-morbid—civic-minded—domestic—(I forgot
to mention the radio) normal—that’s the sort of go-getter that had ought to go in
for dogs.The cat is for the aristocrat—whether by birth or inclinations or both—who
admires his fellow-aristocrats (even if Little Belknap isn’t especially fond of Felis).
He is for the man who appreciates beauty as the one living force in a blind and purposeless
universe, and who worships that beauty in all its forms without regard for the sentimental and
ethical illusions of the moment. For the man who knows the hollowness of feeling and the emptiness
of human objects and aspirations, and who therefore clings solely to what is real—as beauty
is real because it pretends to no significance beyond the emotion which it excites and is. For
the man who feels sufficient in the cosmos, and asks no false perspective of exaltation; who
is moved by no mawkish scruples of conventional prejudice, but loves repose and strength and
freedom and luxury and superiority and sufficiency and contemplation; who as a strong fearless
soul wishes something to respect instead of something to lick his face and accept his alternate
blows and strokings; who seeks a proud and beautiful equal in the peerage of individualism rather
than a cowed and cringing satellite in the hierarchy of fear, subservience, and devotion. The
cat is not for the brisk, self-important little worker with a “mission”, but for
the enlightened dreaming poet who knows that the world contains nothing really worth doing.
The dilettante—the connoisseur—the decadent, if you will, though in a healthier
age than this there were things for such men to do, so that they were the planners and leaders
of those glorious pagan times. The cat is for him who does things not for empty duty but for
power, pleasure, splendour, romance, and glamour—for the harpist who sings alone in the
night of old battles, or the warrior who goes out to fight such battles for beauty, glory, fame,
and the splendour of a kingly court athwart which no shadow of weakness or democracy falls.
For him who will be lulled by no sops of prose and usefulness, but demands for his effort the
ease and beauty and ascendancy and cultivation which alone make effort worth while. For the
man who knows that play, not work, and leisure, not bustle, are the great things of life; and
that the round of striving merely in order to strive some more is a bitter irony of which the
civilised soul accepts as little as it can.Beauty, sufficiency, ease, and good manners—what more can civilisation
require? We have them all in the divine little monarch who lounges gloriously on his silken
cushion before the hearth. Loveliness and joy for their own sake—pride and harmony and
coördination—spirit, restfulness, and completeness—all here are present, and
need but a sympathetic disillusionment for worship in full measure. What fully civilised soul
but would eagerly serve as high-priest of Bast? The star of the cat, I think, is just now in
the ascendant, as we emerge little by little from the dreams of ethics and democracy which clouded
the nineteenth century and raised the grubbing and unlovely dog to the pinnacle of sentimental
regard. Whether a renaissance of monarchy and beauty will restore our Western civilisation,
or whether the forces of disintegration are already too powerful for even the fascist sentiment
to check, none may yet say; but in the present moment of cynical world-unmasking between the
pretence of the eighteen-hundreds and the ominous mystery of the decades ahead we have at least
a flash of the old pagan perspective and the old pagan clearness and honesty.And one idol lit up by that flash, seen fair and lovely on a dream-throne of
silk and gold under a chryselephantine dome, is a shape of deathless grace not always given
its due among groping mortals—the haughty, the unconquered, the mysterious, the luxurious,
the Babylonian, the impersonal, the eternal companion of superiority and art—the type
of perfect beauty and the brother of poetry—the bland, grave, competent, and patrician
cat."
The Despised PastoralBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Among the many and complex tendencies observable in modern poetry, or what answers for poetry
in this age, is a decided but unjust scorn of the honest old pastoral, immortalised by Theocritus
and Virgil, and revived in our own literature by Spenser.Nor is this unfavourable attitude confined alone to the formal eclogue whose
classical elements are so well described and exemplified by Mr. Pope. Whenever a versifier adorns
his song with the pleasing and innocent imagery of this type of composition, or borrows its
mild and sweet atmosphere, he is forthwith condemned as an irresponsible pedant and fossil by
every little-wit critic in Grub-Street.Modern bards, in their endeavour to display with seriousness and minute verisimilitude
the inward operations of the human mind and emotions, have come to look down upon the simple
description of ideal beauty, or the straightforward presentation of pleasing images for no other
purpose than to delight the fancy. Such themes they deem trivial and artificial, and altogether
unworthy of an art whose design they take to be the analysis and reproduction of Nature in all
her moods and aspects.But in this belief, the writer cannot but hold that our contemporaries are
misjudging the true province and functions of poesy. It was no starched classicist, but the
exceedingly unconventional Edgar Allan Poe, who roundly denounced the melancholy metaphysicians
and maintained that true poetry has for its first object “pleasure, not truth”,
and “indefinite pleasure instead of definite pleasure”. Mr. Poe, in another essay,
defined poetry as “the rhythmical creation of beauty”, intimating that its concern
for the dull or ugly aspects of life is slight indeed. That the American bard and critic was
fundamentally just in his deductions, seems well proved by a comparative survey of those poems
of all ages which have lived, and those which have fallen into deserved obscurity.The English pastoral, based upon the best models of antiquity, depicts engaging
scenes of Arcadian simplicity, which not only transport the imagination through their intrinsic
beauty, but recall to the scholarly mind the choicest remembrances of classical Greece and Rome.
Though the combination of rural pursuits with polished sentiments and diction is patently artificial,
the beauty is not a whit less; nor do the conventional names, phrases, and images detract in
the least from the quaint agreeableness of the whole. The magic of this sort of verse is to
any unprejudiced mind irresistible, and is capable of evoking a more deliciously placid and
refreshing train of pictures in the imagination, than may be obtained from any more realistic
species of composition. Every untainted fancy begets ideal visions of which the pastoral forms
a legitimate and artistically necessary reflection.It is not impossible that the intellectual upheaval attendant upon the present
conflict will bring about a general simplification and rectification of taste, and an appreciation
of the value of pure imaginary beauty in a world so full of actual misery, which may combine
to restore the despised pastoral to its proper station."
Literary CompositionBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"In a former article our readers have been shewn the fundamental sources of literary inspiration,
   and the leading prerequisites to expression. It remains to furnish hints concerning expression
   itself—its forms, customs, and technicalities—in order that the young writer may
   lose nothing of force or charm in presenting his ideas to the public.GrammarA review of the elements of English grammar would be foreign to the purpose of
   this department. The subject is one taught in all common schools, and may be presumed to be
   understood by every aspirant to authorship. It is necessary, however, to caution the beginner to
   keep a reliable grammar and dictionary always beside him, that he may avoid in his compositions
   the frequent errors which imperceptibly corrupt even the purest ordinary speech. As a general
   rule, it is well to give close critical scrutiny to all colloquial phrases and expressions of
   doubtful parsing, as well as to all words and usages which have a strained or unfamiliar sound.
   The human memory is not to be trusted too far, and most minds harbour a considerable number of
   slight linguistic faults and inelegancies picked up from random discourse or from the pages of
   newspapers, magazines, and popular modern books.Types of MistakesMost of the mistakes of young authors, aside from those gross violations of syntax
   which ordinary education corrects, may perhaps be enumerated as follows.(1)Erroneous plurals of nouns, asvalliesorechos.(2)Barbarous compound nouns, asviewpointorupkeep.(3)Want of correspondence in number between noun and verb
         where the two are widely separated or the construction involved.(4)Ambiguous use of pronouns.(5)Erroneous case of pronouns, aswhomforwho,and vice versa, or phrases like “between you andI”, or “Letwewho are loyal, act promptly.”(6)Erroneous use ofshallandwill,and of other
         auxiliary verbs.(7)Use of intransitive for transitive verbs, as “hewas graduatedfrom college”, or vice versa, as “heingratiatedwith the tyrant”.(8)Use of nouns for verbs, as “hemotoredto
         Boston”, or “hevoiceda protest”.(9)Errors in moods and tenses of verbs, as “If Iwashe, I should do otherwise”, or “He said the earthwasround.”(10)The split infinitive, as “tocalmlyglide”.(11)The erroneous perfect infinitive, as “Last week I
         expectedto have metyou.”(12)False verb-forms, as “Ipledwith
         him.”(13)Use oflikeforas,as “I strive to
         writelikePope wrote.”(14)Misuse of prepositions, as “The gift was bestowedtoan unworthy object”, or “The gold was dividedbetweenthe
         five men.”(15)The superfluous conjunction, as “I wishforyou to do this.”(16)Use of words in wrong senses, as “The book greatlyintriguedme”, “Leaveme take this”, “He wasobsessedwith the idea”, or “He is ameticulouswriter.”(17)Erroneous use of non-Anglicised foreign forms, as “a
         strangephenomena”, or “twostratasof
         clouds”.(18)Use of false or unauthorised words, asburglariseorsupremest.(19)Errors of taste, including vulgarisms, pompousness,
         repetition, vagueness, ambiguousness, colloquialism, bathos, bombast, pleonasm, tautology,
         harshness, mixed metaphor, and every sort of rhetorical
         awkwardness.(20)Errors of spelling and punctuation, and confusion of forms
         such as that which leads many to place an apostrophe in the possessive pronounits.Of all blunders, there is hardly one which might not be avoided through diligent
   study of simple textbooks on grammar and rhetoric, intelligent perusal of the best authors, and
   care and forethought in composition. Almost no excuse exists for their persistent occurrence,
   since the sources of correction are so numerous and so available. Many of the popular manuals of
   good English are extremely useful, especially to persons whose reading is not as yet extensive;
   but such works sometimes err in being too pedantically precise and formal. For correct writing,
   the cultivation of patience and mental accuracy is essential. Throughout the young
   author’s period of apprenticeship, he must keep reliable dictionaries and textbooks at his
   elbow; eschewing as far as possible that hasty extemporaneous manner of writing which is the
   privilege of more advanced students. He must take no popular usage for granted, nor must he ever
   hesitate, in case of doubt, to fall back on the authority of his books.ReadingNo aspiring author should content himself with a mere acquisition of technical
   rules. As Mrs. Renshaw remarked in the preceding article, “Impression should ever precede
   and be stronger than expression.” All attempts at gaining literary polish must begin with
   judiciousreading,and the learner must never cease to hold this phase uppermost. In many
   cases, the usage of good authors will be found a more effective guide than any amount of
   precept. A page of Addison or of Irving will teach more of style than a whole manual of rules,
   whilst a story of Poe’s will impress upon the mind a more vivid notion of powerful and
   correct description and narration than will ten dry chapters of a bulky text-book. Let every
   student read unceasingly the best writers, guided by the admirable Reading Table which has
   adorned theUnited Amateurduring the past two years.It is also important that cheaper types of reading, if hitherto followed, be
   dropped. Popular magazines inculcate a careless and deplorable style which is hard to unlearn,
   and which impedes the acquisition of a purer style. If such things must be read, let them be
   skimmed over as lightly as possible. An excellent habit to cultivate is the analytical study of
   the King James Bible. For simple yet rich and forceful English, this masterly production is hard
   to equal; and even though its Saxon vocabulary and poetic rhythm be unsuited to general
   composition, it is an invaluable model for writers on quaint or imaginative themes. Lord
   Dunsany, perhaps the greatest living prose artist, derived nearly all of his stylistic
   tendencies from the Scriptures; and the contemporary critic Boyd points out very acutely the
   loss sustained by most Catholic Irish writers through their unfamiliarity with the historic
   volume and its traditions.VocabularyOne superlatively important effect of wide reading is the enlargement of
   vocabulary which always accompanies it. The average student is gravely impeded by the narrow
   range of words from which he must choose, and he soon discovers that in long compositions he
   cannot avoid monotony. In reading, the novice should note the varied mode of expression
   practiced by good authors, and should keep in his mind for future use the many appropriate
   synonyms he encounters. Never should an unfamiliar word be passed over without elucidation; for
   with a little conscientious research we may each day add to our conquests in the realm of
   philology, and become more and more ready for graceful independent expression.But in enlarging the vocabulary, we must beware lest we misuse our new
   possessions. We must remember that there are fine distinctions betwixt apparently similar words,
   and that language must ever be selected with intelligent care. As the learned Dr. Blair points
   out in his Lectures, “Hardly in any language are there two words that convey precisely the
   same idea; a person thoroughly conversant in the propriety of language will always be able to
   observe something that distinguishes them.”Elemental PhasesBefore considering the various formal classes of composition, it is well to note
   certain elements common to them all. Upon analysis, every piece of writing will be found to
   contain one or more of the following basic principles:Description,or an account of the
   appearance of things;Narration,or an account of the actions of things;Exposition,which defines and explains with precision and lucidity;Argument,which discovers truth and rejects error; andPersuasion,which urges to certain thoughts
   or acts. The first two are the bases of fiction; the third didactic, scientific, historical, and
   editorial writings. The fourth and fifth are mostly employed in conjunction with the third, in
   scientific, philosophical, and partisan literature. All these principles, however, are usually
   mingled with one another. The work of fiction may have its scientific, historical, or
   argumentative side; whilst the text-book or treatise may be embellished with descriptions and
   anecdotes.DescriptionDescription, in order to be effective, calls upon two mental qualities:
   observation and discrimination. Many descriptions depend for their vividness upon the accurate
   reproduction of details; others upon the judicious selection of salient, typical, or significant
   points.One cannot be too careful in the selection of adjectives for descriptions. Words
   or compounds which describe precisely, and which convey exactly the right suggestions to the
   mind of the reader, are essential. As an example, let us consider the following list of epithets
   applicable to afountain,taken from Richard Green Parker’s admirable work on
   composition.Crystal, gushing, rustling, silver, gently-gliding, parting,
      pearly, weeping, bubbling, gurgling, chiding, clear, grass-fringed, moss-fringed,
      pebble-paved, verdant, sacred, grass-margined, moss-margined, trickling, soft, dew-sprinkled,
      fast-flowing, delicate, delicious, clean, straggling, dancing, vaulting, deep-embosomed,
      leaping, murmuring, muttering, whispering, prattling, twaddling, swelling, sweet-rolling,
      gently-flowing, rising, sparkling, flowing, frothy, dew-distilling, dew-born, exhaustless,
      inexhaustible, never-decreasing, never-falling, heaven-born, earth-born, deep-divulging,
      drought-dispelling, thirst-allaying, refreshing, soul-refreshing, earth-refreshing, laving,
      lavish, plant-nourishing.For the purpose of securing epithets at once accurate and felicitous, the young
   author should familiarise himself thoroughly with the general aspect and phenomena of Nature, as
   well as with the ideas and associations which these things produce in the human mind.Descriptions may be of objects, of places, of animals, and of persons. The
   complete description of an object may be said to consist of the following elements:When, where, and how seen; when made or found; how affected by time.History and traditional associations.Substance and manner of origin.Size, shape, and appearance.Analogies with similar objects.Sensations produced by contemplating it.Its purpose or function.Its effects—the results of its existence.Descriptions of places must of course vary with the type of the place. Of natural
   scenery, the following elements are notable:How beheld—at dawn, noon, evening, or night; by starlight or moonlight.Natural features—flat or hilly; barren or thickly grown; kind of vegetation; trees,
   mountains, and rivers.Works of man—cultivation, edifices, bridges, modifications of scenery produced by
   man.Inhabitants and other forms of animal life.Local customs and traditions.Sounds—of water; forest; leaves; birds; barnyards; human beings; machinery.View—prospect on every side, and the place itself as seen from afar.Analogies to other scenes, especially famous scenes.History and associations.Sensations produced by contemplating it.Descriptions of animals may be analyzed thus:Species and size.Covering.Parts.Abode.Characteristics and habits.Food.Utility or harmfulness.History and associations.Descriptions of persons can be infinitely varied. Sometimes a single felicitous
   touch brings out the whole type and character, as when the modern author Leonard Merrick hints
   at shabby gentility by mentioning the combination of a frock coat with the trousers of a tweed
   suit. Suggestion is very powerful in this field, especially when mental qualities are to be
   delineated. Treatment should vary with the author’s object; whether to portray a mere
   personified idea, or to give a quasi-photographic view, mental and physical, of some vividly
   living character. In a general description, the following elements may be found:Appearance, stature, complexion, proportions, features.Most conspicuous feature.Expression.Grace or ugliness.Attire—nature, taste, quality.Habits, attainments, graces, or awkwardnesses.Character—moral and intellectual; place in the community.Notable special qualities.In considering the preceding synopses, the reader must remember that they are only
   suggestions, and not forliteraluse. The extent of any description is to be determined
   by its place in the composition; by taste and fitness. It should be added, that in fiction
   description must not be carried to excess. A plethora of it leads to dulness, so that it must
   ever be balanced by a brisk flow ofNarration,which we are about to
   consider.NarrationNarration is an account of action, or of successive events, either real or
   imagined; and is therefore the basis both of history and of fiction. To be felicitous and
   successful, it demands an intelligent exercise of taste and discrimination; salient points must
   be selected, and the order of time and of circumstances must be well maintained. It is deemed
   wisest in most cases to give narratives a climactic form; leading from lesser to greater events,
   and culminating in that chief incident upon which the story is primarily founded, or which makes
   the other parts important through its own importance. This principle, of course, cannot be
   literally followed in all historical and biographical narratives.Fictional NarrationThe essential point of fictional narration isplot,which may be defined as
   asequence of incidents designed to awaken the reader’s interest and curiosity as to
   the result.Plots may be simple or complex; but suspense, and climactic progress from one
   incident to another, are essential. Every incident in a fictional work should have some bearing
   on the climax or denouement, and any denouement which is not the inevitable result of the
   preceding incidents is awkward and unliterary. No formal course in fiction-writing can equal a
   close and observant perusal of the stories of Edgar Allan Poe or Ambrose Bierce. In these
   masterpieces one may find that unbroken sequence and linkage of incident and result which mark
   the ideal tale. Observe how, in “The Fall of the House of Usher”, each separate
   event foreshadows and leads up to the tremendous catastrophe and its hideous suggestion. Poe was
   an absolute master of the mechanics of his craft. Observe also how Bierce can attain the most
   stirring denouements from a few simple happenings; denouements which develop purely from these
   preceding circumstances.In fictional narration, verisimilitude is absolutely essential. A story must be
   consistent and must contain no event glaringly removed from the usual order of things, unless
   that event is the main incident, and is approached with the most careful preparation. In real
   life, odd and erratic things do occasionally happen; but they are out of place in an ordinary
   story, since fiction is a sort of idealisation of the average. Development should be as
   life-like as possible, and a weak, trickling conclusion should be assiduously avoided. The end
   of a story must be stronger rather than weaker than the beginning; since it is the end which
   contains the denouement or culmination, and which will leave the strongest impression upon the
   reader. It would not be amiss for the novice to write the last paragraph of his story first,
   once a synopsis of the plot has been carefully prepared—as it always should be. In this
   way he will be able to concentrate his freshest mental vigour upon the most important part of
   his narrative; and if any changes be later found needful, they can easily be made. In no part of
   a narrative should a grand or emphatic thought or passage be followed by one of tame or prosaic
   quality. This isanticlimax,and exposes a writer to much ridicule. Notice the absurd
   effect of the following couplet—which was, however, written by no less a person than
   Waller:“Under the
   tropic is our language spoke,And part of Flanders hath receiv’d our
   yoke.”Unity, Mass, CoherenceIn developing a theme, whether descriptive or narrative, it is necessary that
   three structural qualities be present: Unity, Mass, and Coherence. Unity is that principle
   whereby every part of a composition must have some bearing on the central theme. It is the
   principle which excludes all extraneous matter, and demands that all threads converge toward the
   climax. Classical violations of Unity may be found in theepisodesof Homer and other
   epic poets of antiquity, as well as in the digressions of Fielding and other celebrated
   novelists; but no beginner should venture to emulate such liberties. Unity is the quality we
   have lately noted and praised in Poe and Bierce.Mass is that principle which requires the more important parts of a composition to
   occupy correspondingly important places in the whole composition, the paragraph, and the
   sentence. It is that law of taste which insists that emphasis be placed where emphasis is due,
   and is most strikingly embodied in the previously mentioned necessity for an emphatic ending.
   According to this law, the end of a composition is its most important part, with the beginning
   next in importance.Coherence is that principle which groups related parts together and keeps
   unrelated parts removed from one another. It applies, like Mass, to the whole composition, the
   paragraph, or the sentence. It demands that kindred events be narrated without interruption,
   effect following cause in a steady flow.Forms of CompositionFew writers succeed equally in all the various branches of literature. Each type
   of thought has its own particular form of expression, based on natural appropriateness; and the
   average author tends to settle into that form which best fits his particular personality. Many,
   however, follow more than one form; and some writers change from one form to another as
   advancing years produce alterations in their mental processes or points of view.It is well, in the interests of breadth and discipline, for the beginner to
   exercise himself to some degree in every form of literary art. He may thus discover that which
   best fits his mind, and develop hitherto unsuspected potentialities.We have so far surveyed only those simpler phases of writing which centre in prose
   fiction and descriptive essays. Hereafter we hope to touch upon didactic, argumentative, and
   persuasive writing; to investigate to some extent the sources of rhetorical strength and
   elegance; and to consider a few major aspects of versification."
Metrical RegularityBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"“Deteriores omnes
sumus licentia.”—Terence.Of the various forms of decadence manifest in the poetical art of the present age, none strikes
more harshly on our sensibilities than the alarming decline in that harmonious regularity of
metre which adorned the poetry of our immediate ancestors.That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a principle
which not even the assertions of an Aristotle or the pronouncements of a Plato can disestablish.
As old a critic as Dionysius of Halicarnassus and as modern a philosopher as Hegel have each
affirmed that versification in poetry is not alone a necessary attribute, but the very foundation
as well; Hegel, indeed, placing metre above metaphorical imagination as the essence of all poetic
creation.Science can likewise trace the metrical instinct from the very infancy of mankind,
or even beyond, to the pre-human age of the apes. Nature is in itself an unending succession
of regular impulses. The steady recurrence of the seasons and of the moonlight, the coming and
going of the day, the ebb and flow of the tides, the beating of the heart and pulses, the tread
of the feet in walking, and countless other phenomena of like regularity, have all combined
to inculcate in the human brain a rhythmic sense which is as manifest in the most uncultivated,
as in the most polished of peoples. Metre, therefore, is no such false artifice as most exponents
of radicalism would have us believe, but is instead a natural and inevitable embellishment to
poesy, which succeeding ages should develop and refine, rather than maim or destroy.Like other instincts, the metric sense has taken on different aspects among
different races. Savages shew it in its simplest form while dancing to the sound of primitive
drums; barbarians display it in their religious and other chantings; civilised peoples utilise
it for their formal poetry, either as measured quantity, like that of Greek and Roman verse,
or as measured accentual stress, like that of our own English verse. Precision of metre is thus
no mere display of meretricious ornament, but a logical evolution from eminently natural sources.It is the contention of the ultra-modern poet, as enunciated by Mrs. J. W.
Renshaw in her recent article on “The Autocracy of Art” (The Looking Glassfor May), that the truly inspired bard must chant forth his feelings independently of form or
language, permitting each changing impulse to alter the rhythm of his lay, and blindly resigning
his reason to the “fine frenzy” of his mood. This contention is of course founded
upon the assumption that poetry is super-intellectual; the expression of a “soul”
which outranks the mind and its precepts. Now while avoiding the impeachment of this dubious
theory, we must needs remark, that the laws of Nature cannot so easily be outdistanced. However
much true poesy may overtop the produce of the brain, it must still be affected by natural laws,
which are universal and inevitable. Wherefore it is possible for the critic to assume the attitude
of the scientist, and to perceive the various clearly defined natural forms through which the
emotions seek expressions. Indeed, we feel even unconsciously the fitness of certain types of
metre for certain types of thought, and in perusing a crude or irregular poem are often abruptly
repelled by the unwarranted variations made by the bard, either through his ignorance or his
perverted taste. We are naturally shocked at the clothing of a grave subject in anapaestic metre,
or the treatment of a long and lofty theme in short, choppy lines. This latter defect is what
repels us so much from Conington’s really scholarly translation of the Aeneid.What the radicals so wantonly disregard in their eccentric performances is
unity of thought. Amidst their wildly repeated leaps from one rough metre to another, they ignore
the underlying uniformity of each of their poems. Scene may change; atmosphere may vary; yet
one poem cannot but carry one definite message, and to suit this ultimate and fundamental message
must one metre be selected and sustained. To accommodate the minor inequalities of tone in a
poem, one regular metre will amply lend itself to diversity. Our chief, but now annoyingly neglected
measure, the heroic couplet, is capable of taking on infinite shades of expression by the right
selection and sequence of words, and by the proper placing of the caesura or pause in each line.
Dr. Blair, in his 38th lecture, explains and illustrates with admirable perspicuity the importance
of the caesura’s location in varying the flow of heroic verse. It is also possible to
lend variety to a poem by using very judiciously occasional feet of a metre different from that
of the body of the work. This is generally done without disturbing the syllabification, and
it in no way impairs or obscures the dominant measure.Most amusing of all the claims of the radical is the assertion that true poetic
fervour can never be confined to regular metre; that the wild-eyed, long-haired rider of Pegasus
must inflict upon a suffering public in unaltered form the vague conceptions which flit in noble
chaos through his exalted soul. While it is perfectly obvious that the hour of rare inspiration
must be improved without the hindrance of grammars or rhyming dictionaries, it is no less obvious
that the succeeding hour of calmer contemplation may very profitably be devoted to amendment
and polishing. The “language of the heart” must be clarified and made intelligible
to other hearts, else its purport will forever be confined to its creator. If natural laws of
metrical construction be wilfully set aside, the reader’s attention will be distracted
from the soul of the poem to its uncouth and ill-fitting dress. The more nearly perfect the
metre, the less conspicuous its presence; hence if the poet desires supreme consideration for
his matter, he should make his verses so smooth that the sense may never be interrupted.The ill effect of metrical laxity on the younger generation of poets is enormous.
These latest suitors of the Muse, not yet sufficiently trained to distinguish between their
own artless crudities and the cultivated monstrosities of the educated but radical bard, come
to regard with distrust the orthodox critics, and to believe that no grammatical, rhetorical,
or metrical skill is necessary to their own development. The result cannot but be a race of
churlish, cacophonous hybrids, whose amorphous outcries will waver uncertainly betwixt prose
and verse, absorbing the vices of both and the virtues of neither.When proper consideration shall be taken of the perfect naturalness of polished
metre, a wholesome reaction against the present chaos must inevitably occur; so that the few
remaining disciples of conservatism and good taste may justly entertain one last, lingering
hope of hearing from modern lyres the stately heroics of Pope, the majestic blank verse of Thomson,
the terse octosyllabics of Swift, the sonorous quatrains of Gray, and the lively anapaests of
Sheridan and Moore."
Notes on Writing Weird FictionBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"My reason for writing stories is to give myself the satisfaction of visualising more clearly
and detailedly and stably the vague, elusive, fragmentary impressions of wonder, beauty, and
adventurous expectancy which are conveyed to me by certain sights (scenic, architectural, atmospheric,
etc.), ideas, occurrences, and images encountered in art and literature. I choose weird stories
because they suit my inclination best—one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being
to achieve, momentarily, the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the galling
limitations of time, space, and natural law which for ever imprison us and frustrate our curiosity
about the infinite cosmic spaces beyond the radius of our sight and analysis. These stories
frequently emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest and strongest emotion,
and the one which best lends itself to the creation of nature-defying illusions. Horror and
the unknown or the strange are always closely connected, so that it is hard to create a convincing
picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or “outsideness” without laying
stress on the emotion of fear. The reason whytimeplays a great part in so many of my
tales is that this element looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible
thing in the universe.Conflict with timeseems to me the most potent and fruitful theme
in all human expression.While my chosen form of story-writing is obviously a special and perhaps a
narrow one, it is none the less a persistent and permanent type of expression, as old as literature
itself. There will always be a small percentage of persons who feel a burning curiosity about
unknown outer space, and a burning desire to escape from the prison-house of the known and the
real into those enchanted lands of incredible adventure and infinite possibilities which dreams
open up to us, and which things like deep woods, fantastic urban towers, and flaming sunsets
momentarily suggest. These persons include great authors as well as insignificant amateurs like
myself—Dunsany, Poe, Arthur Machen, M. R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Walter de la
Mare being typical masters in this field.As to how I write a story—there is no one way. Each one of my tales has
a different history. Once or twice I have literally written out a dream; but usually I start
with a mood or idea or image which I wish to express, and revolve it in my mind until I can
think of a good way of embodying it in some chain of dramatic occurrences capable of being recorded
in concrete terms. I tend to run through a mental list of the basic conditions or situations
best adapted to such a mood or idea or image, and then begin to speculate on logical and naturally
motivated explanations of the given mood or idea or image in terms of the basic condition or
situation chosen.The actual process of writing is of course as varied as the choice of theme
and initial conception; but if the history of all my tales were analysed, it is just possible
that the following set of rules might be deduced from theaverageprocedure:(1) Prepare a synopsis or scenario of events in the order of their absoluteoccurrence—not the order of their narration. Describe with enough fulness to cover
all vital points and motivate all incidents planned. Details, comments, and estimates of consequences
are sometimes desirable in this temporary framework.(2) Prepare a second synopsis or scenario of events—this one in order
ofnarration(not actual occurrence), with ample fulness and detail, and with notes as
to changing perspective, stresses, and climax. Change the original synopsis to fit if such a
change will increase the dramatic force or general effectiveness of the story. Interpolate or
delete incidents at will—never being bound by the original conception even if the ultimate
result be a tale wholly different from that first planned. Let additions and alterations be
made whenever suggested by anything in the formulating process.(3) Write out the story—rapidly, fluently, and not too critically—following
thesecondor narrative-order synopsis. Change incidents and plot whenever the developing
process seems to suggest such change, never being bound by any previous design. If the development
suddenly reveals new opportunities for dramatic effect or vivid storytelling, add whatever is
thought advantageous—going back and reconciling the early parts to the new plan. Insert
and delete whole sections if necessary or desirable, trying different beginnings and endings
until the best arrangement is found. But be sure that all references throughout the story are
thoroughly reconciled with the final design. Remove all possible superfluities—words,
sentences, paragraphs, or whole episodes or elements—observing the usual precautions about
the reconciling of all references.(4) Revise the entire text, paying attention to vocabulary, syntax, rhythm
of prose, proportioning of parts, niceties of tone, grace and convincingness or transitions
(scene to scene, slow and detailed action to rapid and sketchy time-covering action and vice
versa. . . . etc., etc., etc.), effectiveness of beginning, ending, climaxes, etc.,
dramatic suspense and interest, plausibility and atmosphere, and various other elements.(5) Prepare a neatly typed copy—not hesitating to add final revisory
touches where they seem in order.The first of these stages is often purely a mental one—a set of conditions
and happenings being worked out in my head, and never set down until I am ready to prepare a
detailed synopsis of events in order of narration. Then, too, I sometimes begin even the actual
writing before I know how I shall develop the idea—this beginning forming a problem to
be motivated and exploited.There are, I think, four distinct types of weird story; one expressing amood or feeling,another expressing apictorial conception,a third expressing ageneral situation, condition, legend, or intellectual conception,and a fourth explaining
adefinite tableau or specific dramatic situation or climax.In another way, weird tales
may be grouped into two rough categories—those in which the marvel or horror concerns
someconditionorphenomenon,and those in which it concerns someaction of
personsin connexion with a bizarre condition or phenomenon.Each weird story—to speak more particularly of the horror type—seems
to involve five definite elements: (a) some basic, underlying horror or abnormality—condition,
entity, etc.—, (b) the general effects or bearings of the horror, (c) the mode of manifestation—object
embodying the horror and phenomena observed—, (d) the types of fear-reaction pertaining
to the horror, and (e) the specific effects of the horror in relation to the given set of conditions.In writing a weird story I always try very carefully to achieve the right mood
and atmosphere, and place the emphasis where it belongs. One cannot, except in immature pulp
charlatan–fiction, present an account of impossible, improbable, or inconceivable phenomena
as a commonplace narrative of objective acts and conventional emotions. Inconceivable events
and conditions have a special handicap to overcome, and this can be accomplished only through
the maintenance of a careful realism in every phase of the storyexceptthat touching
on the one given marvel. This marvel must be treated very impressively and deliberately—with
a careful emotional “build-up”—else it will seem flat and unconvincing. Being
the principal thing in the story, its mere existence should overshadow the characters and events.
But the characters and events must be consistent and natural except where they touch the single
marvel. In relation to the central wonder, the characters should shew the same overwhelming
emotion which similar characters would shew toward such a wonder in real life. Never have a
wonder taken for granted. Even when the characters are supposed to be accustomed to the wonder
I try to weave an air of awe and impressiveness corresponding to what the reader should feel.
A casual style ruins any serious fantasy.Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird fiction. Indeed,
all that a wonder story can ever be isa vivid picture of a certain type of human mood.The moment it tries to be anything else it becomes cheap, puerile, and unconvincing. Prime emphasis
should be given tosubtle suggestion—imperceptible hints and touches of selective
associative detail which express shadings of moods and build up a vague illusion of the strange
reality of the unreal. Avoid bald catalogues of incredible happenings which can have no substance
or meaning apart from a sustaining cloud of colour and symbolism.These are the rules or standards which I have followed—consciously or
unconsciously—ever since I first attempted the serious writing of fantasy. That my results
are successful may well be disputed—but I feel at least sure that, had I ignored the considerations
mentioned in the last few paragraphs, they would have been much worse than they are."
Supernatural Horror in LiteratureBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"I. IntroductionThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear
is fear of the unknown. These facts few psychologists will dispute, and their admitted truth
must establish for all time the genuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale as a literary
form. Against it are discharged all the shafts of a materialistic sophistication which clings
to frequently felt emotions and external events, and of a naively insipid idealism which deprecates
the aesthetic motive and calls for a didactic literature to uplift the reader toward a suitable
degree of smirking optimism. But in spite of all this opposition the weird tale has survived,
developed, and attained remarkable heights of perfection; founded as it is on a profound and
elementary principle whose appeal, if not always universal, must necessarily be poignant and
permanent to minds of the requisite sensitiveness.The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands
from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from every-day
life. Relatively few are free enough from the spell of the daily routine to respond to rappings
from outside, and tales of ordinary feelings and events, or of common sentimental distortions
of such feelings and events, will always take first place in the taste of the majority; rightly,
perhaps, since of course these ordinary matters make up the greater part of human experience.
But the sensitive are always with us, and sometimes a curious streak of fancy invades an obscure
corner of the very hardest head; so that no amount of rationalisation, reform, or Freudian analysis
can quite annul the thrill of the chimney-corner whisper or the lonely wood. There is here involved
a psychological pattern or tradition as real and as deeply grounded in mental experience as
any other pattern or tradition of mankind; coeval with the religious feeling and closely related
to many aspects of it, and too much a part of our inmost biological heritage to lose keen potency
over a very important, though not numerically great, minority of our species.Man’s first instincts and emotions formed his response to the environment
in which he found himself. Definite feelings based on pleasure and pain grew up around the phenomena
whose causes and effects he understood, whilst around those which he did not understand—and
the universe teemed with them in the early days—were naturally woven such personifications,
marvellous interpretations, and sensations of awe and fear as would be hit upon by a race having
few and simple ideas and limited experience. The unknown, being likewise the unpredictable,
became for our primitive forefathers a terrible and omnipotent source of boons and calamities
visited upon mankind for cryptic and wholly extra-terrestrial reasons, and thus clearly belonging
to spheres of existence whereof we know nothing and wherein we have no part. The phenomenon
of dreaming likewise helped to build up the notion of an unreal or spiritual world; and in general,
all the conditions of savage dawn-life so strongly conduced toward a feeling of the supernatural,
that we need not wonder at the thoroughness with which man’s very hereditary essence has
become saturated with religion and superstition. That saturation must, as a matter of plain
scientific fact, be regarded as virtually permanent so far as the subconscious mind and inner
instincts are concerned; for though the area of the unknown has been steadily contracting for
thousands of years, an infinite reservoir of mystery still engulfs most of the outer cosmos,
whilst a vast residuum of powerful inherited associations clings around all the objects and
processes that were once mysterious, however well they may now be explained. And more than this,
there is an actual physiological fixation of the old instincts in our nervous tissue, which
would make them obscurely operative even were the conscious mind to be purged of all sources
of wonder.Because we remember pain and the menace of death more vividly than pleasure,
and because our feelings toward the beneficent aspects of the unknown have from the first been
captured and formalised by conventional religious rituals, it has fallen to the lot of the darker
and more maleficent side of cosmic mystery to figure chiefly in our popular supernatural folklore.
This tendency, too, is naturally enhanced by the fact that uncertainty and danger are always
closely allied; thus making any kind of an unknown world a world of peril and evil possibilities.
When to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable fascination of wonder and curiosity is superadded,
there is born a composite body of keen emotion and imaginative provocation whose vitality must
of necessity endure as long as the human race itself. Children will always be afraid of the
dark, and men with minds sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at the thought
of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the
stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in unholy dimensions which only the dead and the
moonstruck can glimpse.With this foundation, no one need wonder at the existence of a literature of
cosmic fear. It has always existed, and always will exist; and no better evidence of its tenacious
vigour can be cited than the impulse which now and then drives writers of totally opposite leanings
to try their hands at it in isolated tales, as if to discharge from their minds certain phantasmal
shapes which would otherwise haunt them. Thus Dickens wrote several eerie narratives; Browning,
the hideous poem “Childe Roland”; Henry James,The Turn of the Screw;Dr.
Holmes, the subtle novelElsie Venner;F. Marion Crawford, “The Upper Berth”
and a number of other examples; Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, social worker, “The Yellow
Wall Paper”; whilst the humourist W. W. Jacobs produced that able melodramatic bit called
“The Monkey’s Paw”.This type of fear-literature must not be confounded with a type externally
similar but psychologically widely different; the literature of mere physical fear and the mundanely
gruesome. Such writing, to be sure, has its place, as has the conventional or even whimsical
or humorous ghost story where formalism or the author’s knowing wink removes the true
sense of the morbidly unnatural; but these things are not the literature of cosmic fear in its
purest sense. The true weird tale has something more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a
sheeted form clanking chains according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable
dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness
and portentousness becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human brain—a
malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only
safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space.Naturally we cannot expect all weird tales to conform absolutely to any theoretical
model. Creative minds are uneven, and the best of fabrics have their dull spots. Moreover, much
of the choicest weird work is unconscious; appearing in memorable fragments scattered through
material whose massed effect may be of a very different cast. Atmosphere is the all-important
thing, for the final criterion of authenticity is not the dovetailing of a plot but the creation
of a given sensation. We may say, as a general thing, that a weird story whose intent is to
teach or produce a social effect, or one in which the horrors are finally explained away by
natural means, is not a genuine tale of cosmic fear; but it remains a fact that such narratives
often possess, in isolated sections, atmospheric touches which fulfil every condition of true
supernatural horror-literature. Therefore we must judge a weird tale not by the author’s
intent, or by the mere mechanics of the plot; but by the emotional level which it attains at
its least mundane point. If the proper sensations are excited, such a “high spot”
must be admitted on its own merits as weird literature, no matter how prosaically it is later
dragged down. The one test of the really weird is simply this—whether or not there be
excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact with unknown spheres and powers;
a subtle attitude of awed listening, as if for the beating of black wings or the scratching
of outside shapes and entities on the known universe’s utmost rim. And of course, the
more completely and unifiedly a story conveys this atmosphere, the better it is as a work of
art in the given medium.II. The Dawn of the Horror-TaleAs may naturally be expected of a form so closely connected with primal emotion,
the horror-tale is as old as human thought and speech themselves.Cosmic terror appears as an ingredient of the earliest folklore of all races,
and is crystallised in the most archaic ballads, chronicles, and sacred writings. It was, indeed,
a prominent feature of the elaborate ceremonial magic, with its rituals for the evocation of
daemons and spectres, which flourished from prehistoric times, and which reached its highest
development in Egypt and the Semitic nations. Fragments like the Book of Enoch and the Claviculae
of Solomon well illustrate the power of the weird over the ancient Eastern mind, and upon such
things were based enduring systems and traditions whose echoes extend obscurely even to the
present time. Touches of this transcendental fear are seen in classic literature, and there
is evidence of its still greater emphasis in a ballad literature which paralleled the classic
stream but vanished for lack of a written medium. The Middle Ages, steeped in fanciful darkness,
gave it an enormous impulse toward expression; and East and West alike were busy preserving
and amplifying the dark heritage, both of random folklore and of academically formulated magic
and cabbalism, which had descended to them. Witch, werewolf, vampire, and ghoul brooded ominously
on the lips of bard and grandam, and needed but little encouragement to take the final step
across the boundary that divides the chanted tale or song from the formal literary composition.
In the Orient, the weird tale tended to assume a gorgeous colouring and sprightliness which
almost transmuted it into sheer phantasy. In the West, where the mystical Teuton had come down
from his black Boreal forests and the Celt remembered strange sacrifices in Druidic groves,
it assumed a terrible intensity and convincing seriousness of atmosphere which doubled the force
of its half-told, half-hinted horrors.Much of the power of Western horror-lore was undoubtedly due to the hidden
but often suspected presence of a hideous cult of nocturnal worshippers whose strange customs—descended
from pre-Aryan and pre-agricultural times when a squat race of Mongoloids roved over Europe
with their flocks and herds—were rooted in the most revolting fertility-rites of immemorial
antiquity. This secret religion, stealthily handed down amongst peasants for thousands of years
despite the outward reign of the Druidic, Graeco-Roman, and Christian faiths in the regions
involved, was marked by wild “Witches’ Sabbaths” in lonely woods and atop
distant hills on Walpurgis-Night and Hallowe’en, the traditional breeding-seasons of the
goats and sheep and cattle; and became the source of vast riches of sorcery-legend, besides
provoking extensive witchcraft-prosecutions of which the Salem affair forms the chief American
example. Akin to it in essence, and perhaps connected with it in fact, was the frightful secret
system of inverted theology or Satan-worship which produced such horrors as the famous “Black
Mass”; whilst operating toward the same end we may note the activities of those whose
aims were somewhat more scientific or philosophical—the astrologers, cabbalists, and alchemists
of the Albertus Magnus or Raymond Lully type, with whom such rude ages invariably abound. The
prevalence and depth of the mediaeval horror-spirit in Europe, intensified by the dark despair
which waves of pestilence brought, may be fairly gauged by the grotesque carvings slyly introduced
into much of the finest later Gothic ecclesiastical work of the time; the daemoniac gargoyles
of Notre Dame and Mont St. Michel being among the most famous specimens. And throughout the
period, it must be remembered, there existed amongst educated and uneducated alike a most unquestioning
faith in every form of the supernatural; from the gentlest of Christian doctrines to the most
monstrous morbidities of witchcraft and black magic. It was from no empty background that the
Renaissance magicians and alchemists—Nostradamus, Trithemius, Dr. John Dee, Robert Fludd,
and the like—were born.In this fertile soil were nourished types and characters of sombre myth and
legend which persist in weird literature to this day, more or less disguised or altered by modern
technique. Many of them were taken from the earliest oral sources, and form part of mankind’s
permanent heritage. The shade which appears and demands the burial of its bones, the daemon
lover who comes to bear away his still living bride, the death-fiend or psychopomp riding the
night-wind, the man-wolf, the sealed chamber, the deathless sorcerer—all these may be
found in that curious body of mediaeval lore which the late Mr. Baring-Gould so effectively
assembled in book form. Wherever the mystic Northern blood was strongest, the atmosphere of
the popular tales became most intense; for in the Latin races there is a touch of basic rationality
which denies to even their strangest superstitions many of the overtones of glamour so characteristic
of our own forest-born and ice-fostered whisperings.Just as all fiction first found extensive embodiment in poetry, so is it in
poetry that we first encounter the permanent entry of the weird into standard literature. Most
of the ancient instances, curiously enough, are in prose; as the werewolf incident in Petronius,
the gruesome passages in Apuleius, the brief but celebrated letter of Pliny the Younger to Sura,
and the odd compilationOn Wonderful Eventsby the Emperor Hadrian’s Greek freedman,
Phlegon. It is in Phlegon that we first find that hideous tale of the corpse-bride, “Philinnion
and Machates”, later related by Proclus and in modern times forming the inspiration of
Goethe’s “Bride of Corinth” and Washington Irving’s “German Student”.
But by the time the old Northern myths take literary form, and in that later time when the weird
appears as a steady element in the literature of the day, we find it mostly in metrical dress;
as indeed we find the greater part of the strictly imaginative writing of the Middle Ages and
Renaissance. The Scandinavian Eddas and Sagas thunder with cosmic horror, and shake with the
stark fear of Ymir and his shapeless spawn; whilst our own Anglo-SaxonBeowulfand the
later Continental Nibelung tales are full of eldritch weirdness. Dante is a pioneer in the classic
capture of macabre atmosphere, and in Spenser’s stately stanzas will be seen more than
a few touches of fantastic terror in landscape, incident, and character. Prose literature gives
us Malory’sMorte d’Arthur,in which are presented many ghastly situations
taken from early ballad sources—the theft of the sword and silk from the corpse in Chapel
Perilous by Sir Launcelot, the ghost of Sir Gawaine, and the tomb-fiend seen by Sir Galahad—whilst
other and cruder specimens were doubtless set forth in the cheap and sensational “chapbooks”
vulgarly hawked about and devoured by the ignorant. In Elizabethan drama, with itsDr. Faustus,the witches inMacbeth,the ghost inHamlet,and the horrible gruesomeness of
Webster, we may easily discern the strong hold of the daemoniac on the public mind; a hold intensified
by the very real fear of living witchcraft, whose terrors, first wildest on the Continent, begin
to echo loudly in English ears as the witch-hunting crusades of James the First gain headway.
To the lurking mystical prose of the ages is added a long line of treatises on witchcraft and
daemonology which aid in exciting the imagination of the reading world.Through the seventeenth and into the eighteenth century we behold a growing
mass of fugitive legendry and balladry of darksome cast; still, however, held down beneath the
surface of polite and accepted literature. Chapbooks of horror and weirdness multiplied, and
we glimpse the eager interest of the people through fragments like Defoe’s “Apparition
of Mrs. Veal”, a homely tale of a dead woman’s spectral visit to a distant friend,
written to advertise covertly a badly selling theological disquisition on death. The upper orders
of society were now losing faith in the supernatural, and indulging in a period of classic rationalism.
Then, beginning with the translations of Eastern tales in Queen Anne’s reign and taking
definite form toward the middle of the century, comes the revival of romantic feeling—the
era of new joy in Nature, and in the radiance of past times, strange scenes, bold deeds, and
incredible marvels. We feel it first in the poets, whose utterances take on new qualities of
wonder, strangeness, and shuddering. And finally, after the timid appearance of a few weird
scenes in the novels of the day—such as Smollett’sAdventures of Ferdinand, Count
Fathom—the released instinct precipitates itself in the birth of a new school of writing;
the “Gothic” school of horrible and fantastic prose fiction, long and short, whose
literary posterity is destined to become so numerous, and in many cases so resplendent in artistic
merit. It is, when one reflects upon it, genuinely remarkable that weird narration as a fixed
and academically recognised literary form should have been so late of final birth. The impulse
and atmosphere are as old as man, but the typical weird tale of standard literature is a child
of the eighteenth century.III. The Early Gothic NovelThe shadow-haunted landscapes of “Ossian”, the chaotic visions
of William Blake, the grotesque witch-dances in Burns’s “Tam O’Shanter”,
the sinister daemonism of Coleridge’sChristabelandAncient Mariner,the
ghostly charm of James Hogg’s “Kilmeny”,and the more restrained approaches
to cosmic horror inLamiaand many of Keats’s other poems, are typical British
illustrations of the advent of the weird to formal literature. Our Teutonic cousins of the Continent
were equally receptive to the rising flood, and Bürger’s “Wild Huntsman”
and the even more famous daemon-bridegroom ballad of “Lenore”—both imitated
in English by Scott, whose respect for the supernatural was always great—are only a taste
of the eerie wealth which German song had commenced to provide. Thomas Moore adapted from such
sources the legend of the ghoulish statue-bride (later used by Prosper Mérimée
in “The Venus of Ille”, and traceable back to great antiquity) which echoes so shiveringly
in his ballad of “The Ring”; whilst Goethe’s deathless masterpieceFaust,crossing from mere balladry into the classic, cosmic tragedy of the ages, may be held as
the ultimate height to which this German poetic impulse arose.But it remained for a very sprightly and worldly Englishman—none other
than Horace Walpole himself—to give the growing impulse definite shape and become the
actual founder of the literary horror-story as a permanent form. Fond of mediaeval romance and
mystery as a dilettante’s diversion, and with a quaintly imitated Gothic castle as his
abode at Strawberry Hill, Walpole in 1764 publishedThe Castle of Otranto;a tale of
the supernatural which, though thoroughly unconvincing and mediocre in itself, was destined
to exert an almost unparalleled influence on the literature of the weird. First venturing it
only as a translation by one “William Marshal, Gent.” from the Italian of a mythical
“Onuphrio Muralto”, the author later acknowledged his connexion with the book and
took pleasure in its wide and instantaneous popularity—a popularity which extended to
many editions, early dramatisation, and wholesale imitation both in England and in Germany.The story—tedious, artificial, and melodramatic—is further impaired
by a brisk and prosaic style whose urbane sprightliness nowhere permits the creation of a truly
weird atmosphere. It tells of Manfred, an unscrupulous and usurping prince determined to found
a line, who after the mysterious sudden death of his only son Conrad on the latter’s bridal
morn, attempts to put away his wife Hippolita and wed the lady destined for the unfortunate
youth—the lad, by the way, having been crushed by the preternatural fall of a gigantic
helmet in the castle courtyard. Isabella, the widowed bride, flees from this design; and encounters
in subterranean crypts beneath the castle a noble young preserver, Theodore, who seems to be
a peasant yet strangely resembles the old lord Alfonso who ruled the domain before Manfred’s
time. Shortly thereafter supernatural phenomena assail the castle in divers ways; fragments
of gigantic armour being discovered here and there, a portrait walking out of its frame, a thunderclap
destroying the edifice, and a colossal armoured spectre of Alfonso rising out of the ruins to
ascend through parting clouds to the bosom of St. Nicholas. Theodore, having wooed Manfred’s
daughter Matilda and lost her through death—for she is slain by her father by mistake—is
discovered to be the son of Alfonso and rightful heir to the estate. He concludes the tale by
wedding Isabella and preparing to live happily ever after, whilst Manfred—whose usurpation
was the cause of his son’s supernatural death and his own supernatural harassings—retires
to a monastery for penitence; his saddened wife seeking asylum in a neighbouring convent.Such is the tale; flat, stilted, and altogether devoid of the true cosmic horror
which makes weird literature. Yet such was the thirst of the age for those touches of strangeness
and spectral antiquity which it reflects, that it was seriously received by the soundest readers
and raised in spite of its intrinsic ineptness to a pedestal of lofty importance in literary
history. What it did above all else was to create a novel type of scene, puppet-characters,
and incidents; which, handled to better advantage by writers more naturally adapted to weird
creation, stimulated the growth of an imitative Gothic school which in turn inspired the real
weavers of cosmic terror—the line of actual artists beginning with Poe. This novel dramatic
paraphernalia consisted first of all of the Gothic castle, with its awesome antiquity, vast
distances and ramblings, deserted or ruined wings, damp corridors, unwholesome hidden catacombs,
and galaxy of ghosts and appalling legends, as a nucleus of suspense and daemoniac fright. In
addition, it included the tyrannical and malevolent nobleman as villain; the saintly, longpersecuted,
and generally insipid heroine who undergoes the major terrors and serves as a point of view
and focus for the reader’s sympathies; the valorous and immaculate hero, always of high
birth but often in humble disguise; the convention of high-sounding foreign names, mostly Italian,
for the characters; and the infinite array of stage properties which includes strange lights,
damp trap-doors, extinguished lamps, mouldy hidden manuscripts, creaking hinges, shaking arras,
and the like. All this paraphernalia reappears with amusing sameness, yet sometimes with tremendous
effect, throughout the history of the Gothic novel; and is by no means extinct even today, though
subtler technique now forces it to assume a less naive and obvious form. An harmonious milieu
for a new school had been found, and the writing world was not slow to grasp the opportunity.German romance at once responded to the Walpole influence, and soon became
a byword for the weird and ghastly. In England one of the first imitators was the celebrated
Mrs. Barbauld, then Miss Aikin, who in 1773 published an unfinished fragment called “Sir
Bertrand”, in which the strings of genuine terror were truly touched with no clumsy hand.
A nobleman on a dark and lonely moor, attracted by a tolling bell and distant light, enters
a strange and ancient turreted castle whose doors open and close and whose bluish will-o’-the-wisps
lead up mysterious staircases toward dead hands and animated black statues. A coffin with a
dead lady, whom Sir Bertrand kisses, is finally reached; and upon the kiss the scene dissolves
to give place to a splendid apartment where the lady, restored to life, holds a banquet in honour
of her rescuer. Walpole admired this tale, though he accorded less respect to an even more prominent
offspring of hisOtranto—The Old English Baron,by Clara Reeve, published
in 1777. Truly enough, this tale lacks the real vibration to the note of outer darkness and
mystery which distinguishes Mrs. Barbauld’s fragment; and though less crude than Walpole’s
novel, and more artistically economical of horror in its possession of only one spectral figure,
it is nevertheless too definitely insipid for greatness. Here again we have the virtuous heir
to the castle disguised as a peasant and restored to his heritage through the ghost of his father;
and here again we have a case of wide popularity leading to many editions, dramatisation, and
ultimate translation into French. Miss Reeve wrote another weird novel, unfortunately unpublished
and lost.The Gothic novel was now settled as a literary form, and instances multiply
bewilderingly as the eighteenth century draws toward its close.The Recess,written in
1785 by Mrs. Sophia Lee, has the historic element, revolving round the twin daughters of Mary,
Queen of Scots; and though devoid of the supernatural, employs the Walpole scenery and mechanism
with great dexterity. Five years later, and all existing lamps are paled by the rising of a
fresh luminary of wholly superior order—Mrs. Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823), whose famous
novels made terror and suspense a fashion, and who set new and higher standards in the domain
of macabre and fear-inspiring atmosphere despite a provoking custom of destroying her own phantoms
at the last through laboured mechanical explanations. To the familiar Gothic trappings of her
predecessors Mrs. Radcliffe added a genuine sense of the unearthly in scene and incident which
closely approached genius; every touch of setting and action contributing artistically to the
impression of illimitable frightfulness which she wished to convey. A few sinister details like
a track of blood on castle stairs, a groan from a distant vault, or a weird song in a nocturnal
forest can with her conjure up the most powerful images of imminent horror; surpassing by far
the extravagant and toilsome elaborations of others. Nor are these images in themselves any
the less potent because they are explained away before the end of the novel. Mrs. Radcliffe’s
visual imagination was very strong, and appears as much in her delightful landscape touches—always
in broad, glamorously pictorial outline, and never in close detail—as in her weird phantasies.
Her prime weaknesses, aside from the habit of prosaic disillusionment, are a tendency toward
erroneous geography and history and a fatal predilection for bestrewing her novels with insipid
little poems, attributed to one or another of the characters.Mrs. Radcliffe wrote six novels;The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne(1789),A Sicilian Romance(1790),The Romance of the Forest(1791),The Mysteries
of Udolpho(1794),The Italian(1797), andGaston de Blondeville,composed
in 1802 but first published posthumously in 1826. Of theseUdolphois by far the most
famous, and may be taken as a type of the early Gothic tale at its best. It is the chronicle
of Emily, a young Frenchwoman transplanted to an ancient and portentous castle in the Apennines
through the death of her parents and the marriage of her aunt to the lord of the castle—the
scheming nobleman Montoni. Mysterious sounds, opened doors, frightful legends, and a nameless
horror in a niche behind a black veil all operate in quick succession to unnerve the heroine
and her faithful attendant Annette; but finally, after the death of her aunt, she escapes with
the aid of a fellow-prisoner whom she has discovered. On the way home she stops at a chateau
filled with fresh horrors—the abandoned wing where the departed chatelaine dwelt, and
the bed of death with the black pall—but is finally restored to security and happiness
with her lover Valancourt, after the clearing-up of a secret which seemed for a time to involve
her birth in mystery. Clearly, this is only the familiar material re-worked; but it is so well
re-worked thatUdolphowill always be a classic. Mrs. Radcliffe’s characters are
puppets, but they are less markedly so than those of her forerunners. And in atmospheric creation
she stands preëminent among those of her time.Of Mrs. Radcliffe’s countless imitators, the American novelist Charles
Brockden Brown stands the closest in spirit and method. Like her, he injured his creations by
natural explanations; but also like her, he had an uncanny atmospheric power which gives his
horrors a frightful vitality as long as they remain unexplained. He differed from her in contemptuously
discarding the external Gothic paraphernalia and properties and choosing modern American scenes
for his mysteries; but this repudiation did not extend to the Gothic spirit and type of incident.
Brown’s novels involve some memorably frightful scenes, and excel even Mrs. Radcliffe’s
in describing the operations of the perturbed mind.Edgar Huntlystarts with a sleep-walker
digging a grave, but is later impaired by touches of Godwinian didacticism.Ormondinvolves
a member of a sinister secret brotherhood. That andArthur Mervynboth describe the plague
of yellow fever, which the author had witnessed in Philadelphia and New York. But Brown’s
most famous book isWieland; or, The Transformation(1798), in which a Pennsylvania German,
engulfed by a wave of religious fanaticism, hears voices and slays his wife and children as
a sacrifice. His sister Clara, who tells the story, narrowly escapes. The scene, laid at the
woodland estate of Mittingen on the Schuylkill’s remote reaches, is drawn with extreme
vividness; and the terrors of Clara, beset by spectral tones, gathering fears, and the sound
of strange footsteps in the lonely house, are all shaped with truly artistic force. In the end
a lame ventriloquial explanation is offered, but the atmosphere is genuine while it lasts. Carwin,
the malign ventriloquist, is a typical villain of the Manfred or Montoni type.IV. The Apex of Gothic RomanceHorror in literature attains a new malignity in the work of Matthew Gregory
Lewis (1775–1818), whose novelThe Monk(1796) achieved marvellous popularity and
earned him the nickname of “Monk” Lewis. This young author, educated in Germany
and saturated with a body of wild Teuton lore unknown to Mrs. Radcliffe, turned to terror in
forms more violent than his gentle predecessor had ever dared to think of; and produced as a
result a masterpiece of active nightmare whose general Gothic cast is spiced with added stores
of ghoulishness. The story is one of a Spanish monk, Ambrosio, who from a state of overproud
virtue is tempted to the very nadir of evil by a fiend in the guise of the maiden Matilda; and
who is finally, when awaiting death at the Inquisition’s hands, induced to purchase escape
at the price of his soul from the Devil, because he deems both body and soul already lost. Forthwith
the mocking Fiend snatches him to a lonely place, tells him he has sold his soul in vain since
both pardon and a chance for salvation were approaching at the moment of his hideous bargain,
and completes the sardonic betrayal by rebuking him for his unnatural crimes, and casting his
body down a precipice whilst his soul is borne off for ever to perdition. The novel contains
some appalling descriptions such as the incantation in the vaults beneath the convent cemetery,
the burning of the convent, and the final end of the wretched abbot. In the sub-plot where the
Marquis de las Cisternas meets the spectre of his erring ancestress, The Bleeding Nun, there
are many enormously potent strokes; notably the visit of the animated corpse to the Marquis’s
bedside, and the cabbalistic ritual whereby the Wandering Jew helps him to fathom and banish
his dead tormentor. NeverthelessThe Monkdrags sadly when read as a whole. It is too
long and too diffuse, and much of its potency is marred by flippancy and by an awkwardly excessive
reaction against those canons of decorum which Lewis at first despised as prudish. One great
thing may be said of the author; that he never ruined his ghostly visions with a natural explanation.
He succeeded in breaking up the Radcliffian tradition and expanding the field of the Gothic
novel. Lewis wrote much more thanThe Monk.His drama,The Castle Spectre,was
produced in 1798, and he later found time to pen other fictions in ballad form—Tales
of Terror(1799),Tales of Wonder(1801), and a succession of translations from the
German.Gothic romances, both English and German, now appeared in multitudinous and
mediocre profusion. Most of them were merely ridiculous in the light of mature taste, and Miss
Austen’s famous satireNorthanger Abbeywas by no means an unmerited rebuke to
a school which had sunk far toward absurdity. This particular school was petering out, but before
its final subordination there arose its last and greatest figure in the person of Charles Robert
Maturin (1782–1824), an obscure and eccentric Irish clergyman. Out of an ample body of
miscellaneous writing which includes one confused Radcliffian imitation calledFatal Revenge;
or, The Family of Montorio(1807), Maturin at length evolved the vivid horror-masterpiece
ofMelmoth the Wanderer(1820), in which the Gothic tale climbed to altitudes of sheer
spiritual fright which it had never known before.Melmothis the tale of an Irish gentleman who, in the seventeenth century,
obtained a preternaturally extended life from the Devil at the price of his soul. If he can
persuade another to take the bargain off his hands, and assume his existing state, he can be
saved; but this he can never manage to effect, no matter how assiduously he haunts those whom
despair has made reckless and frantic. The framework of the story is very clumsy; involving
tedious length, digressive episodes, narratives within narratives, and laboured dovetailing
and coincidences; but at various points in the endless rambling there is felt a pulse of power
undiscoverable in any previous work of this kind—a kinship to the essential truth of human
nature, an understanding of the profoundest sources of actual cosmic fear, and a white heat
of sympathetic passion on the writer’s part which makes the book a true document of aesthetic
self-expression rather than a mere clever compound of artifice. No unbiassed reader can doubt
that withMelmothan enormous stride in the evolution of the horror-tale is represented.
Fear is taken out of the realm of the conventional and exalted into a hideous cloud over mankind’s
very destiny. Maturin’s shudders, the work of one capable of shuddering himself, are of
the sort that convince. Mrs. Radcliffe and Lewis are fair game for the parodist, but it would
be difficult to find a false note in the feverishly intensified action and high atmospheric
tension of the Irishman whose less sophisticated emotions and strain of Celtic mysticism gave
him the finest possible natural equipment for his task. Without a doubt Maturin is a man of
authentic genius, and he was so recognised by Balzac, who grouped Melmoth with Molière’s
Don Juan, Goethe’s Faust, and Byron’s Manfred as the supreme allegorical figures
of modern European literature, and wrote a whimsical piece called “Melmoth Reconciled”,
in which the Wanderer succeeds in passing his infernal bargain on to a Parisian bank defaulter,
who in turn hands it along a chain of victims until a revelling gambler dies with it in his
possession, and by his damnation ends the curse. Scott, Rossetti, Thackeray, and Baudelaire
are the other titans who gave Maturin their unqualified admiration, and there is much significance
in the fact that Oscar Wilde, after his disgrace and exile, chose for his last days in Paris
the assumed name of “Sebastian Melmoth”.Melmothcontains scenes which even now have not lost their power to
evoke dread. It begins with a deathbed—an old miser is dying of sheer fright because of
something he has seen, coupled with a manuscript he has read and a family portrait which hangs
in an obscure closet of his centuried home in County Wicklow. He sends to Trinity College, Dublin,
for his nephew John; and the latter upon arriving notes many uncanny things. The eyes of the
portrait in the closet glow horribly, and twice a figure strangely resembling the portrait appears
momentarily at the door. Dread hangs over that house of the Melmoths, one of whose ancestors,
“J. Melmoth, 1646”, the portrait represents. The dying miser declares that this
man—at a date slightly before 1800—is alive. Finally the miser dies, and the nephew
is told in the will to destroy both the portrait and a manuscript to be found in a certain drawer.
Reading the manuscript, which was written late in the seventeenth century by an Englishman named
Stanton, young John learns of a terrible incident in Spain in 1677, when the writer met a horrible
fellow-countryman and was told of how he had stared to death a priest who tried to denounce
him as one filled with fearsome evil. Later, after meeting the man again in London, Stanton
is cast into a madhouse and visited by the stranger, whose approach is heralded by spectral
music and whose eyes have a more than mortal glare. Melmoth the Wanderer—for such is the
malign visitor—offers the captive freedom if he will take over his bargain with the Devil;
but like all others whom Melmoth has approached, Stanton is proof against temptation. Melmoth’s
description of the horrors of a life in a madhouse, used to tempt Stanton, is one of the most
potent passages of the book. Stanton is at length liberated, and spends the rest of his life
tracking down Melmoth, whose family and ancestral abode he discovers. With the family he leaves
the manuscript, which by young John’s time is sadly ruinous and fragmentary. John destroys
both portrait and manuscript, but in sleep is visited by his horrible ancestor, who leaves a
black and blue mark on his wrist.Young John soon afterward receives as a visitor a shipwrecked Spaniard, Alonzo
de Monçada, who has escaped from compulsory monasticism and from the perils of the Inquisition.
He has suffered horribly—and the descriptions of his experiences under torment and in
the vaults through which he once essays escape are classic—but had the strength to resist
Melmoth the Wanderer when approached at his darkest hour in prison. At the house of a Jew who
sheltered him after his escape he discovers a wealth of manuscript relating other exploits of
Melmoth including his wooing of an Indian island maiden, Immalee, who later comes to her birthright
in Spain and is known as Donna Isidora; and of his horrible marriage to her by the corpse of
a dead anchorite at midnight in the ruined chapel of a shunned and abhorred monastery. Monçada’s
narrative to young John takes up the bulk of Maturin’s four-volume book; this disproportion
being considered one of the chief technical faults of the composition.At last the colloquies of John and Monçada are interrupted by the entrance
of Melmoth the Wanderer himself, his piercing eyes now fading, and decrepitude swiftly overtaking
him. The term of his bargain has approached its end, and he has come home after a century and
a half to meet his fate. Warning all others from the room, no matter what sounds they may hear
in the night, he awaits the end alone. Young John and Monçada hear frightful ululations,
but do not intrude till silence comes toward morning. They then find the room empty. Clayey
footprints lead out a rear door to a cliff overlooking the sea, and near the edge of the precipice
is a track indicating the forcible dragging of some heavy body. The Wanderer’s scarf is
found on a crag some distance below the brink, but nothing further is ever seen or heard of
him.Such is the story, and none can fail to notice the difference between this
modulated, suggestive, and artistically moulded horror and—to use the words of Professor
George Saintsbury—“the artful but rather jejune rationalism of Mrs. Radcliffe, and
the too often puerile extravagance, the bad taste, and the sometimes slipshod style of Lewis.”
Maturin’s style in itself deserves particular praise, for its forcible directness and
vitality lift it altogether above the pompous artificialities of which his predecessors are
guilty. Professor Edith Birkhead, in her history of the Gothic novel, justly observes that with
all his faults Maturin was the greatest as well as the last of the Goths.Melmothwas
widely read and eventually dramatised, but its late date in the evolution of the Gothic tale
deprived it of the tumultuous popularity ofUdolphoandThe Monk.V. The Aftermath of Gothic FictionMeanwhile other hands had not been idle, so that above the dreary plethora
of trash like Marquis von Grosse’sHorrid Mysteries(1796), Mrs. Roche’sChildren of the Abbey(1796), Miss Dacre’sZofloya; or, The Moor(1806),
and the poet Shelley’s schoolboy effusionsZastrozzi(1810) andSt. Irvyne(1811) (both imitations ofZofloya) there arose many memorable weird works both in English
and German. Classic in merit, and markedly different from its fellows because of its foundation
in the Oriental tale rather than the Walpolesque Gothic novel, is the celebratedHistory
of the Caliph Vathekby the wealthy dilettante William Beckford, first written in the French
language but published in an English translation before the appearance of the original. Eastern
tales, introduced to European literature early in the eighteenth century through Galland’s
French translation of the inexhaustibly opulentArabian Nights,had become a reigning
fashion; being used both for allegory and for amusement. The sly humour which only the Eastern
mind knows how to mix with weirdness had captivated a sophisticated generation, till Bagdad
and Damascus names became as freely strown through popular literature as dashing Italian and
Spanish ones were soon to be. Beckford, well read in Eastern romance, caught the atmosphere
with unusual receptivity; and in his fantastic volume reflected very potently the haughty luxury,
sly disillusion, bland cruelty, urbane treachery, and shadowy spectral horror of the Saracen
spirit. His seasoning of the ridiculous seldom mars the force of his sinister theme, and the
tale marches onward with a phantasmagoric pomp in which the laughter is that of skeletons feasting
under Arabesque domes.Vathekis a tale of the grandson of the Caliph Haroun, who, tormented
by that ambition for super-terrestrial power, pleasure, and learning which animates the average
Gothic villain or Byronic hero (essentially cognate types), is lured by an evil genius to seek
the subterranean throne of the mighty and fabulous pre-Adamite sultans in the fiery halls of
Eblis, the Mahometan Devil. The descriptions of Vathek’s palaces and diversions, of his
scheming sorceress-mother Carathis and her witch-tower with the fifty one-eyed negresses, of
his pilgrimage to the haunted ruins of Istakhar (Persepolis) and of the impish bride Nouronihar
whom he treacherously acquired on the way, of Istakhar’s primordial towers and terraces
in the burning moonlight of the waste, and of the terrible Cyclopean halls of Eblis, where,
lured by glittering promises, each victim is compelled to wander in anguish for ever, his right
hand upon his blazingly ignited and eternally burning heart, are triumphs of weird colouring
which raise the book to a permanent place in English letters. No less notable are the threeEpisodes of Vathek,intended for insertion in the tale as narratives of Vathek’s
fellow-victims in Eblis’ infernal halls, which remained unpublished throughout the author’s
lifetime and were discovered as recently as 1909 by the scholar Lewis Melville whilst collecting
material for hisLife and Letters of William Beckford.Beckford, however, lacks the essential
mysticism which marks the acutest form of the weird; so that his tales have a certain knowing
Latin hardness and clearness preclusive of sheer panic fright.But Beckford remained alone in his devotion to the Orient. Other writers, closer
to the Gothic tradition and to European life in general, were content to follow more faithfully
in the lead of Walpole. Among the countless producers of terror-literature in these times may
be mentioned the Utopian economic theorist William Godwin, who followed his famous but non-supernaturalCaleb Williams(1794) with the intendedly weirdSt. Leon(1799), in which the
theme of the elixir of life, as developed by the imaginary secret order of “Rosicrucians”,
is handled with ingeniousness if not with atmospheric convincingness. This element of Rosicrucianism,
fostered by a wave of popular magical interest exemplified in the vogue of the charlatan Cagliostro
and the publication of Francis Barrett’sThe Magus(1801), a curious and compendious
treatise on occult principles and ceremonies, of which a reprint was made as lately as 1896,
figures in Bulwer-Lytton and in many late Gothic novels, especially that remote and enfeebled
posterity which straggled far down into the nineteenth century and was represented by George
W. M. Reynolds’Faust and the DemonandWagner, the Wehr-wolf. Caleb Williams,though non-supernatural, has many authentic touches of terror. It is the tale of a servant persecuted
by a master whom he has found guilty of murder, and displays an invention and skill which have
kept it alive in a fashion to this day. It was dramatised asThe Iron Chest,and in that
form was almost equally celebrated. Godwin, however, was too much the conscious teacher and
prosaic man of thought to create a genuine weird masterpiece.His daughter, the wife of Shelley, was much more successful; and her inimitableFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus(1818) is one of the horror-classics of all time.
Composed in competition with her husband, Lord Byron, and Dr. John William Polidori in an effort
to prove supremacy in horror-making, Mrs. Shelley’sFrankensteinwas the only one
of the rival narratives to be brought to an elaborate completion; and criticism has failed to
prove that the best parts are due to Shelley rather than to her. The novel, somewhat tinged
but scarcely marred by moral didacticism, tells of the artificial human being moulded from charnel
fragments by Victor Frankenstein, a young Swiss medical student. Created by its designer “in
the mad pride of intellectuality”, the monster possesses full intelligence but owns a
hideously loathsome form. It is rejected by mankind, becomes embittered, and at length begins
the successive murder of all whom young Frankenstein loves best, friends and family. It demands
that Frankenstein create a wife for it; and when the student finally refuses in horror lest
the world be populated with such monsters, it departs with a hideous threat ‘to be with
him on his wedding night’. Upon that night the bride is strangled, and from that time
on Frankenstein hunts down the monster, even into the wastes of the Arctic. In the end, whilst
seeking shelter on the ship of the man who tells the story, Frankenstein himself is killed by
the shocking object of his search and creation of his presumptuous pride. Some of the scenes
inFrankensteinare unforgettable, as when the newly animated monster enters its creator’s
room, parts the curtains of his bed, and gazes at him in the yellow moonlight with watery eyes—“if
eyes they may be called”. Mrs. Shelley wrote other novels, including the fairly notableLast Man;but never duplicated the success of her first effort. It has the true touch
of cosmic fear, no matter how much the movement may lag in places. Dr. Polidori developed his
competing idea as a long short story, “The Vampyre”; in which we behold a suave
villain of the true Gothic or Byronic type, and encounter some excellent passages of stark fright,
including a terrible nocturnal experience in a shunned Grecian wood.In this same period Sir Walter Scott frequently concerned himself with the
weird, weaving it into many of his novels and poems, and sometimes producing such independent
bits of narration as “The Tapestried Chamber” or “Wandering Willie’s
Tale” inRedgauntlet,in the latter of which the force of the spectral and the
diabolic is enhanced by a grotesque homeliness of speech and atmosphere. In 1830 Scott published
hisLetters on Demonology and Witchcraft,which still forms one of our best compendia
of European witch-lore. Washington Irving is another famous figure not unconnected with the
weird; for though most of his ghosts are too whimsical and humorous to form genuinely spectral
literature, a distinct inclination in this direction is to be noted in many of his productions.
“The German Student” inTales of a Traveller(1824) is a slyly concise and
effective presentation of the old legend of the dead bride, whilst woven into the comic tissue
of “The Money-Diggers” in the same volume is more than one hint of piratical apparitions
in the realms which Captain Kidd once roamed. Thomas Moore also joined the ranks of the macabre
artists in the poemAlciphron,which he later elaborated into the prose novel ofThe
Epicurean(1827). Though merely relating the adventures of a young Athenian duped by the
artifice of cunning Egyptian priests, Moore manages to infuse much genuine horror into his account
of subterranean frights and wonders beneath the primordial temples of Memphis. De Quincey more
than once revels in grotesque and arabesque terrors, though with a desultoriness and learned
pomp which deny him the rank of specialist.This era likewise saw the rise of William Harrison Ainsworth, whose romantic
novels teem with the eerie and the gruesome. Capt. Marryat, besides writing such short tales
as “The Werewolf”, made a memorable contribution inThe Phantom Ship(1839),
founded on the legend of the Flying Dutchman, whose spectral and accursed vessel sails for ever
near the Cape of Good Hope. Dickens now rises with occasional weird bits like “The Signalman”,
a tale of ghostly warning conforming to a very common pattern and touched with a verisimilitude
which allies it as much with the coming psychological school as with the dying Gothic school.
At this time a wave of interest in spiritualistic charlatanry, mediumism, Hindoo theosophy,
and such matters, much like that of the present day, was flourishing; so that the number of
weird tales with a “psychic” or pseudo-scientific basis became very considerable.
For a number of these the prolific and popular Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton was responsible; and
despite the large doses of turgid rhetoric and empty romanticism in his products, his success
in the weaving of a certain kind of bizarre charm cannot be denied.“The House and the Brain”, which hints of Rosicrucianism and at
a malign and deathless figure perhaps suggested by Louis XV’s mysterious courtier St.
Germain, yet survives as one of the best short haunted-house tales ever written. The novelZanoni(1842) contains similar elements more elaborately handled, and introduces a vast
unknown sphere of being pressing on our own world and guarded by a horrible “Dweller of
the Threshold” who haunts those who try to enter and fail. Here we have a benign brotherhood
kept alive from age to age till finally reduced to a single member, and as a hero an ancient
Chaldaean sorcerer surviving in the pristine bloom of youth to perish on the guillotine of the
French Revolution. Though full of the conventional spirit of romance, marred by a ponderous
network of symbolic and didactic meanings, and left unconvincing through lack of perfect atmospheric
realisation of the situations hinging on the spectral world,Zanoniis really an excellent
performance as a romantic novel; and can be read with genuine interest today by the not too
sophisticated reader. It is amusing to note that in describing an attempted initiation into
the ancient brotherhood the author cannot escape using the stock Gothic castle of Walpolian
lineage.InA Strange Story(1862) Bulwer-Lytton shews a marked improvement in
the creation of weird images and moods. The novel, despite enormous length, a highly artificial
plot bolstered up by opportune coincidences, and an atmosphere of homiletic pseudo-science designed
to please the matter-of-fact and purposeful Victorian reader, is exceedingly effective as a
narrative; evoking instantaneous and unflagging interest, and furnishing many potent—if
somewhat melodramatic—tableaux and climaxes. Again we have the mysterious user of life’s
elixir in the person of the soulless magician Margrave, whose dark exploits stand out with dramatic
vividness against the modern background of a quiet English town and of the Australian bush;
and again we have shadowy intimations of a vast spectral world of the unknown in the very air
about us—this time handled with much greater power and vitality than inZanoni.One of the two great incantation passages, where the hero is driven by a luminous evil spirit
to rise at night in his sleep, take a strange Egyptian wand, and evoke nameless presences in
the haunted and mausoleum-facing pavilion of a famous Renaissance alchemist, truly stands among
the major terror scenes of literature. Just enough is suggested, and just little enough is told.
Unknown words are twice dictated to the sleep-walker, and as he repeats them the ground trembles,
and all the dogs of the countryside begin to bay at half-seen amorphous shadows that stalk athwart
the moonlight. When a third set of unknown words is prompted, the sleep-walker’s spirit
suddenly rebels at uttering them, as if the soul could recognise ultimate abysmal horrors concealed
from the mind; and at last an apparition of an absent sweetheart and good angel breaks the malign
spell. This fragment well illustrates how far Lord Lytton was capable of progressing beyond
his usual pomp and stock romance toward that crystalline essence of artistic fear which belongs
to the domain of poetry. In describing certain details of incantations, Lytton was greatly indebted
to his amusingly serious occult studies, in the course of which he came in touch with that odd
French scholar and cabbalist Alphonse-Louis Constant (“Eliphas Lévi”), who
claimed to possess the secrets of ancient magic, and to have evoked the spectre of the old Grecian
wizard Apollonius of Tyana, who lived in Nero’s time.The romantic, semi-Gothic, quasi-moral tradition here represented was carried
far down the nineteenth century by such authors as Joseph Sheridan LeFanu, Thomas Preskett Prest
with his famousVarney, the Vampyre(1847), Wilkie Collins, the late Sir H. Rider Haggard
(whoseSheis really remarkably good), Sir A. Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, and Robert Louis
Stevenson—the latter of whom, despite an atrocious tendency toward jaunty mannerisms,
created permanent classics in “Markheim”, “The Body-Snatcher”, andDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Indeed, we may say that this school still survives; for to it clearly
belong such of our contemporary horror-tales as specialise in events rather than atmospheric
details, address the intellect rather than the impressionistic imagination, cultivate a luminous
glamour rather than a malign tensity or psychological verisimilitude, and take a definite stand
in sympathy with mankind and its welfare. It has its undeniable strength, and because of its
“human element” commands a wider audience than does the sheer artistic nightmare.
If not quite so potent as the latter, it is because a diluted product can never achieve the
intensity of a concentrated essence.Quite alone both as a novel and as a piece of terror-literature stands the
famousWuthering Heights(1847) by Emily Brontë, with its mad vista of bleak, windswept
Yorkshire moors and the violent, distorted lives they foster. Though primarily a tale of life,
and of human passions in agony and conflict, its epically cosmic setting affords room for horror
of the most spiritual sort. Heathcliff, the modified Byronic villain-hero, is a strange dark
waif found in the streets as a small child and speaking only a strange gibberish till adopted
by the family he ultimately ruins. That he is in truth a diabolic spirit rather than a human
being is more than once suggested, and the unreal is further approached in the experience of
the visitor who encounters a plaintive child-ghost at a bough-brushed upper window. Between
Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is a tie deeper and more terrible than human love. After her
death he twice disturbs her grave, and is haunted by an impalpable presence which can be nothing
less than her spirit. The spirit enters his life more and more, and at last he becomes confident
of some imminent mystical reunion. He says he feels a strange change approaching, and ceases
to take nourishment. At night he either walks abroad or opens the casement by his bed. When
he dies the casement is still swinging open to the pouring rain, and a queer smile pervades
the stiffened face. They bury him in a grave beside the mound he has haunted for eighteen years,
and small shepherd boys say that he yet walks with his Catherine in the churchyard and on the
moor when it rains. Their faces, too, are sometimes seen on rainy nights behind that upper casement
at Wuthering Heights. Miss Brontë’s eerie terror is no mere Gothic echo, but a tense
expression of man’s shuddering reaction to the unknown. In this respect,Wuthering
Heightsbecomes the symbol of a literary transition, and marks the growth of a new and sounder
school.VI. Spectral Literature on the ContinentOn the Continent literary horror fared well. The celebrated short tales and
novels of Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann (1776–1822) are a byword for mellowness of background
and maturity of form, though they incline to levity and extravagance, and lack the exalted moments
of stark, breathless terror which a less sophisticated writer might have achieved. Generally
they convey the grotesque rather than the terrible. Most artistic of all the Continental weird
tales is the German classicUndine(1811), by Friedrich Heinrich Karl, Baron de la Motte
Fouqué. In this story of a water-spirit who married a mortal and gained a human soul
there is a delicate fineness of craftsmanship which makes it notable in any department of literature,
and an easy naturalness which places it close to the genuine folk-myth. It is, in fact, derived
from a tale told by the Renaissance physician and alchemist Paracelsus in hisTreatise on
Elemental Sprites.Undine, daughter of a powerful water-prince, was exchanged by her father as
a small child for a fisherman’s daughter, in order that she might acquire a soul by wedding
a human being. Meeting the noble youth Huldbrand at the cottage of her foster-father by the
sea at the edge of a haunted wood, she soon marries him, and accompanies him to his ancestral
castle of Ringstetten. Huldbrand, however, eventually wearies of his wife’s supernatural
affiliations, and especially of the appearances of her uncle, the malicious woodland waterfall-spirit
Kühleborn; a weariness increased by his growing affection for Bertalda, who turns out to
be the fisherman’s child for whom Undine was exchanged. At length, on a voyage down the
Danube, he is provoked by some innocent act of his devoted wife to utter the angry words which
consign her back to her supernatural element; from which she can, by the laws of her species,
return only once—to kill him, whether she will or no, if ever he prove unfaithful to her
memory. Later, when Huldbrand is about to be married to Bertalda, Undine returns for her sad
duty, and bears his life away in tears. When he is buried among his fathers in the village churchyard
a veiled, snow-white female figure appears among the mourners, but after the prayer is seen
no more. In her place is seen a little silver spring, which murmurs its way almost completely
around the new grave, and empties into a neighbouring lake. The villagers shew it to this day,
and say that Undine and her Huldbrand are thus united in death. Many passages and atmospheric
touches in this tale reveal Fouqué as an accomplished artist in the field of the macabre;
especially the descriptions of the haunted wood with its gigantic snow-white man and various
unnamed terrors, which occur early in the narrative.Not so well known asUndine,but remarkable for its convincing realism
and freedom from Gothic stock devices, is theAmber Witchof Wilhelm Meinhold, another
product of the German fantastic genius of the earlier nineteenth century. This tale, which is
laid in the time of the Thirty Years’ War, purports to be a clergyman’s manuscript
found in an old church at Coserow, and centres round the writer’s daughter, Maria Schweidler,
who is wrongly accused of witchcraft. She has found a deposit of amber which she keeps secret
for various reasons, and the unexplained wealth obtained from this lends colour to the accusation;
an accusation instigated by the malice of the wolf-hunting nobleman Wittich Appelmann, who has
vainly pursued her with ignoble designs. The deeds of a real witch, who afterward comes to a
horrible supernatural end in prison, are glibly imputed to the hapless Maria; and after a typical
witchcraft trial with forced confessions under torture she is about to be burned at the stake
when saved just in time by her lover, a noble youth from a neighbouring district. Meinhold’s
great strength is in his air of casual and realistic verisimilitude, which intensifies our suspense
and sense of the unseen by half persuading us that the menacing events must somehow be either
the truth or very close to the truth. Indeed, so thorough is this realism that a popular magazine
once published the main points ofThe Amber Witchas an actual occurrence of the seventeenth
century!In the present generation German horror-fiction is most notably represented
by Hanns Heinz Ewers, who brings to bear on his dark conceptions an effective knowledge of modern
psychology. Novels likeThe Sorcerer’s ApprenticeandAlraune,and short
stories like “The Spider”, contain distinctive qualities which raise them to a classic
level.But France as well as Germany has been active in the realm of weirdness. Victor
Hugo, in such tales asHans of Iceland,and Balzac, inThe Wild Ass’s Skin,
Séraphîta,andLouis Lambert,both employ supernaturalism to a greater
or less extent; though generally only as a means to some more human end, and without the sincere
and daemonic intensity which characterises the born artist in shadows. It is in Théophile
Gautier that we first seem to find an authentic French sense of the unreal world, and here there
appears a spectral mastery which, though not continuously used, is recognisable at once as something
alike genuine and profound. Short tales like “Avatar”, “The Foot of the Mummy”,
and “Clarimonde” display glimpses of forbidden visits that allure, tantalise, and
sometimes horrify; whilst the Egyptian visions evoked in “One of Cleopatra’s Nights”
are of the keenest and most expressive potency. Gautier captured the inmost soul of aeon-weighted
Egypt, with its cryptic life and Cyclopean architecture, and uttered once and for all the eternal
horror of its nether world of catacombs, where to the end of time millions of stiff, spiced
corpses will stare up in the blackness with glassy eyes, awaiting some awesome and unrelatable
summons. Gustave Flaubert ably continued the tradition of Gautier in orgies of poetic phantasy
likeThe Temptation of St. Anthony,and but for a strong realistic bias might have been
an arch-weaver of tapestried terrors. Later on we see the stream divide, producing strange poets
and fantaisistes of the Symbolist and Decadent schools whose dark interests really centre more
in abnormalities of human thought and instinct than in the actual supernatural, and subtle story-tellers
whose thrills are quite directly derived from the night-black wells of cosmic unreality. Of
the former class of “artists in sin” the illustrious poet Baudelaire, influenced
vastly by Poe, is the supreme type; whilst the psychological novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans, a
true child of the eighteen-nineties, is at once the summation and finale. The latter and purely
narrative class is continued by Prosper Mérimée, whose “Venus of Ille”
presents in terse and convincing prose the same ancient statue-bride theme which Thomas Moore
cast in ballad form in “The Ring”.The horror-tales of the powerful and cynical Guy de Maupassant, written as
his final madness gradually overtook him, present individualities of their own; being rather
the morbid outpourings of a realistic mind in a pathological state than the healthy imaginative
products of a vision naturally disposed toward phantasy and sensitive to the normal illusions
of the unseen. Nevertheless they are of the keenest interest and poignancy; suggesting with
marvellous force the imminence of nameless terrors, and the relentless dogging of an ill-starred
individual by hideous and menacing representatives of the outer blackness. Of these stories
“The Horla” is generally regarded as the masterpiece. Relating the advent to France
of an invisible being who lives on water and milk, sways the minds of others, and seems to be
the vanguard of a horde of extra-terrestrial organisms arrived on earth to subjugate and overwhelm
mankind, this tense narrative is perhaps without a peer in its particular department; notwithstanding
its indebtedness to a tale by the American Fitz-James O’Brien for details in describing
the actual presence of the unseen monster. Other potently dark creations of de Maupassant are
“Who Knows?”, “The Spectre”, “He?”, “The Diary of
a Madman”, “The White Wolf”, “On the River”, and the grisly verses
entitled “Horror”.The collaborators Erckmann-Chatrian enriched French literature with many spectral
fancies likeThe Man-Wolf,in which a transmitted curse works toward its end in a traditional
Gothic-castle setting. Their power of creating a shuddering midnight atmosphere was tremendous
despite a tendency toward natural explanations and scientific wonders; and few short tales contain
greater horror than “The Invisible Eye”, where a malignant old hag weaves nocturnal
hypnotic spells which induce the successive occupants of a certain inn chamber to hang themselves
on a cross-beam. “The Owl’s Ear” and “The Waters of Death” are
full of engulfing darkness and mystery, the latter embodying the familiar overgrown-spider theme
so frequently employed by weird fictionists. Villiers de l’Isle-Adam likewise followed
the macabre school; his “Torture by Hope”, the tale of a stake-condemned prisoner
permitted to escape in order to feel the pangs of recapture, being held by some to constitute
the most harrowing short story in literature. This type, however, is less a part of the weird
tradition than a class peculiar to itself—the so-calledconte cruel,in which the
wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalisations, frustrations, and
gruesome physical horrors. Almost wholly devoted to this form is the living writer Maurice Level,
whose very brief episodes have lent themselves so readily to theatrical adaptation in the “thrillers”
of the Grand Guignol. As a matter of fact, the French genius is more naturally suited to this
dark realism than to the suggestion of the unseen; since the latter process requires, for its
best and most sympathetic development on a large scale, the inherent mysticism of the Northern
mind.A very flourishing, though till recently quite hidden, branch of weird literature
is that of the Jews, kept alive and nourished in obscurity by the sombre heritage of early Eastern
magic, apocalyptic literature, and cabbalism. The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic,
seems to possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground horror-lore surviving
in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more considerable than is generally imagined. Cabbalism
itself, so prominent during the Middle Ages, is a system of philosophy explaining the universe
as emanations of the Deity, and involving the existence of strange spiritual realms and beings
apart from the visible world, of which dark glimpses may be obtained through certain secret
incantations. Its ritual is bound up with mystical interpretations of the Old Testament, and
attributes an esoteric significance to each letter of the Hebrew alphabet—a circumstance
which has imparted to Hebrew letters a sort of spectral glamour and potency in the popular literature
of magic. Jewish folklore has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when
more thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird fiction. The best
examples of its literary use so far are the German novelThe Golem,by Gustav Meyrink,
and the dramaThe Dybbuk,by the Jewish writer using the pseudonym “Ansky”.
The former, with its haunting shadowy suggestions of marvels and horrors just beyond reach,
is laid in Prague, and describes with singular mastery that city’s ancient ghetto with
its spectral, peaked gables. The name is derived from a fabulous artificial giant supposed to
be made and animated by mediaeval rabbis according to a certain cryptic formula.The Dybbuk,translated and produced in America in 1925, and more recently produced as an opera, describes
with singular power the possession of a living body by the evil soul of a dead man. Both golems
and dybbuks are fixed types, and serve as frequent ingredients of later Jewish tradition.VII. Edgar Allan PoeIn the eighteen-thirties occurred a literary dawn directly affecting not only
the history of the weird tale, but that of short fiction as a whole; and indirectly moulding
the trends and fortunes of a great European aesthetic school. It is our good fortune as Americans
to be able to claim that dawn as our own, for it came in the person of our illustrious and unfortunate
fellow-countryman Edgar Allan Poe. Poe’s fame has been subject to curious undulations,
and it is now a fashion amongst the “advanced intelligentsia” to minimise his importance
both as an artist and as an influence; but it would be hard for any mature and reflective critic
to deny the tremendous value of his work and the pervasive potency of his mind as an opener
of artistic vistas. True, his type of outlook may have been anticipated; but it was he who first
realised its possibilities and gave it supreme form and systematic expression. True also, that
subsequent writers may have produced greater single tales than his; but again we must comprehend
that it was only he who taught them by example and precept the art which they, having the way
cleared for them and given an explicit guide, were perhaps able to carry to greater lengths.
Whatever his limitations, Poe did that which no one else ever did or could have done; and to
him we owe the modern horror-story in its final and perfected state.Before Poe the bulk of weird writers had worked largely in the dark; without
an understanding of the psychological basis of the horror appeal, and hampered by more or less
of conformity to certain empty literary conventions such as the happy ending, virtue rewarded,
and in general a hollow moral didacticism, acceptance of popular standards and values, and striving
of the author to obtrude his own emotions into the story and take sides with the partisans of
the majority’s artificial ideas. Poe, on the other hand, perceived the essential impersonality
of the real artist; and knew that the function of creative fiction is merely to express and
interpret events and sensations as they are, regardless of how they tend or what they prove—good
or evil, attractive or repulsive, stimulating or depressing—with the author always acting
as a vivid and detached chronicler rather than as a teacher, sympathiser, or vendor of opinion.
He saw clearly that all phases of life and thought are equally eligible as subject-matter for
the artist, and being inclined by temperament to strangeness and gloom, decided to be the interpreter
of those powerful feeling, and frequent happenings which attend pain rather than pleasure, decay
rather than growth, terror rather than tranquillity, and which are fundamentally either adverse
or indifferent to the tastes and traditional outward sentiments of mankind, and to the health,
sanity, and normal expansive welfare of the species.Poe’s spectres thus acquired a convincing malignity possessed by none
of their predecessors, and established a new standard of realism in the annals of literary horror.
The impersonal and artistic intent, moreover, was aided by a scientific attitude not often found
before; whereby Poe studied the human mind rather than the usages of Gothic fiction, and worked
with an analytical knowledge of terror’s true sources which doubled the force of his narratives
and emancipated him from all the absurdities inherent in merely conventional shudder-coining.
This example having been set, later authors were naturally forced to conform to it in order
to compete at all; so that in this way a definite change began to affect the main stream of
macabre writing. Poe, too, set a fashion in consummate craftsmanship; and although today some
of his own work seems slightly melodramatic and unsophisticated, we can constantly trace his
influence in such things as the maintenance of a single mood and achievement of a single impression
in a tale, and the rigorous paring down of incidents to such as have a direct bearing on the
plot and will figure prominently in the climax. Truly may it be said that Poe invented the short
story in its present form. His elevation of disease, perversity, and decay to the level of artistically
expressible themes was likewise infinitely far-reaching in effect; for avidly seized, sponsored,
and intensified by his eminent French admirer Charles Pierre Baudelaire, it became the nucleus
of the principal aesthetic movements in France, thus making Poe in a sense the father of the
Decadents and the Symbolists.Poet and critic by nature and supreme attainment, logician and philosopher
by taste and mannerism, Poe was by no means immune from defects and affectations. His pretence
to profound and obscure scholarship, his blundering ventures in stilted and laboured pseudo-humour,
and his often vitriolic outbursts of critical prejudice must all be recognised and forgiven.
Beyond and above them, and dwarfing them to insignificance, was a master’s vision of the
terror that stalks about and within us, and the worm that writhes and slavers in the hideously
close abyss. Penetrating to every festering horror in the gaily painted mockery called existence,
and in the solemn masquerade called human thought and feelings that vision had power to project
itself in blackly magical crystallisations and transmutations; till there bloomed in the sterile
America of the ’thirties and ’forties such a moon-nourished garden of gorgeous poison
fungi as not even the nether slope of Saturn might boast. Verses and tales alike sustain the
burthen of cosmic panic. The raven whose noisome beak pierces the heart, the ghouls that toll
iron bells in pestilential steeples, the vault of Ulalume in the black October night, the shocking
spires and domes under the sea, the “wild, weird clime that lieth, sublime, out of Space—out
of Time”—all these things and more leer at us amidst maniacal rattlings in the seething
nightmare of the poetry. And in the prose there yawn open for us the very jaws of the pit—inconceivable
abnormalities slyly hinted into a horrible half-knowledge by words whose innocence we scarcely
doubt till the cracked tension of the speaker’s hollow voice bids us fear their nameless
implications; daemoniac patterns and presences slumbering noxiously till waked for one phobic
instant into a shrieking revelation that cackles itself to sudden madness or explodes in memorable
and cataclysmic echoes. A Witches’ Sabbath of horror flinging off decorous robes is flashed
before us—a sight the more monstrous because of the scientific skill with which every
particular is marshalled and brought into an easy apparent relation to the known gruesomeness
of material life.Poe’s tales, of course, fall into several classes; some of which contain
a purer essence of spiritual horror than others. The tales of logic and ratiocination, forerunners
of the modern detective story, are not to be included at all in weird literature; whilst certain
others, probably influenced considerably by Hoffmann, possess an extravagance which relegates
them to the borderline of the grotesque. Still a third group deal with abnormal psychology and
monomania in such a way as to express terror but not weirdness. A substantial residuum, however,
represent the literature of supernatural horror in its acutest form; and give their author a
permanent and unassailable place as deity and fountain-head of all modern diabolic fiction.
Who can forget the terrible swollen ship poised on the billow-chasm’s edge in “MS.
Found in a Bottle”—the dark intimations of her unhallowed age and monstrous growth,
her sinister crew of unseeing greybeards, and her frightful southward rush under full sail through
the ice of the Antarctic night, sucked onward by some resistless devil-current toward a vortex
of eldritch enlightenment which must end in destruction? Then there is the unutterable “M.
Valdemar”, kept together by hypnotism for seven months after his death, and uttering frantic
sounds but a moment before the breaking of the spell leaves him “a nearly liquid mass
of loathsome—of detestable putrescence”. In theNarrative of A. Gordon Pymthe voyagers reach first a strange south polar land of murderous savages where nothing is white
and where vast rocky ravines have the form of titanic Egyptian letters spelling terrible primal
arcana of earth; and thereafter a still more mysterious realm where everything is white, and
where shrouded giants and snowy-plumed birds guard a cryptic cataract of mist which empties
from immeasurable celestial heights into a torrid milky sea. “Metzengerstein” horrifies
with its malign hints of a monstrous metempsychosis—the mad nobleman who burns the stable
of his hereditary foe; the colossal unknown horse that issues from the blazing building after
the owner has perished therein; the vanishing bit of ancient tapestry where was shewn the giant
horse of the victim’s ancestor in the Crusades; the madman’s wild and constant riding
on the great horse, and his fear and hatred of the steed; the meaningless prophecies that brood
obscurely over the warring houses; and finally, the burning of the madman’s palace and
the death therein of the owner, borne helpless into the flames and up the vast staircases astride
the beast he has ridden so strangely. Afterward the rising smoke of the ruins takes the form
of a gigantic horse. “The Man of the Crowd”, telling of one who roams day and night
to mingle with streams of people as if afraid to be alone, has quieter effects, but implies
nothing less of cosmic fear. Poe’s mind was never far from terror and decay, and we see
in every tale, poem, and philosophical dialogue a tense eagerness to fathom unplumbed wells
of night, to pierce the veil of death, and to reign in fancy as lord of the frightful mysteries
of time and space.Certain of Poe’s tales possess an almost absolute perfection of artistic
form which makes them veritable beacon-lights in the province of the short story. Poe could,
when he wished, give to his prose a richly poetic cast; employing that archaic and Orientalised
style with jewelled phrase, quasi-Biblical repetition, and recurrent burthen so successfully
used by later writers like Oscar Wilde and Lord Dunsany; and in the cases where he has done
this we have an effect of lyrical phantasy almost narcotic in essence—an opium pageant
of dream in the language of dream, with every unnatural colour and grotesque image bodied forth
in a symphony of corresponding sound. “The Masque of the Red Death”, “Silence—A
Fable”, and “Shadow—A Parable” are assuredly poems in every sense of
the word save the metrical one, and owe as much of their power to aural cadence as to visual
imagery. But it is in two of the less openly poetic tales, “Ligeia” and “The
Fall of the House of Usher”—especially the latter—that one finds those very
summits of artistry whereby Poe takes his place at the head of fictional miniaturists. Simple
and straightforward in plot, both of these tales owe their supreme magic to the cunning development
which appears in the selection and collocation of every least incident. “Ligeia”
tells of a first wife of lofty and mysterious origin, who after death returns through a preternatural
force of will to take possession of the body of a second wife; imposing even her physical appearance
on the temporary reanimated corpse of her victim at the last moment. Despite a suspicion of
prolixity and topheaviness, the narrative reaches its terrific climax with relentless power.
“Usher”, whose superiority in detail and proportion is very marked, hints shudderingly
of obscure life in inorganic things, and displays an abnormally linked trinity of entities at
the end of a long and isolated family history—a brother, his twin sister, and their incredibly
ancient house all sharing a single soul and meeting one common dissolution at the same moment.These bizarre conceptions, so awkward in unskilful hands, become under Poe’s
spell living and convincing terrors to haunt our nights; and all because the author understood
so perfectly the very mechanics and physiology of fear and strangeness—the essential details
to emphasise, the precise incongruities and conceits to select as preliminaries or concomitants
to horror, the exact incidents and allusions to throw out innocently in advance as symbols or
prefigurings of each major step toward the hideous denouement to come, the nice adjustments
of cumulative force and the unerring accuracy in linkage of parts which make for faultless unity
throughout and thunderous effectiveness at the climactic moment, the delicate nuances of scenic
and landscape value to select in establishing and sustaining the desired mood and vitalising
the desired illusion—principles of this kind, and dozens of obscurer ones too elusive
to be described or even fully comprehended by any ordinary commentator. Melodrama and unsophistication
there may be—we are told of one fastidious Frenchman who could not bear to read Poe except
in Baudelaire’s urbane and Gallically modulated translation—but all traces of such
things are wholly overshadowed by a potent and inborn sense of the spectral, the morbid, and
the horrible which gushed forth from every cell of the artist’s creative mentality and
stamped his macabre work with the ineffaceable mark of supreme genius. Poe’s weird tales
arealivein a manner that few others can ever hope to be.Like most fantaisistes, Poe excels in incidents and broad narrative effects
rather than in character drawing. His typical protagonist is generally a dark, handsome, proud,
melancholy, intellectual, highly sensitive, capricious, introspective, isolated, and sometimes
slightly mad gentleman of ancient family and opulent circumstances; usually deeply learned in
strange lore, and darkly ambitious of penetrating to forbidden secrets of the universe. Aside
from a high-sounding name, this character obviously derives little from the early Gothic novel;
for he is clearly neither the wooden hero nor the diabolical villain of Radcliffian or Ludovician
romance. Indirectly, however, he does possess a sort of genealogical connexion; since his gloomy,
ambitious, and anti-social qualities savour strongly of the typical Byronic hero, who in turn
is definitely an offspring of the Gothic Manfreds, Montonis, and Ambrosios. More particular
qualities appear to be derived from the psychology of Poe himself, who certainly possessed much
of the depression, sensitiveness, mad aspiration, loneliness, and extravagant freakishness which
he attributes to his haughty and solitary victims of Fate.VIII. The Weird Tradition in AmericaThe public for whom Poe wrote, though grossly unappreciative of his art, was
by no means unaccustomed to the horrors with which he dealt. America, besides inheriting the
usual dark folklore of Europe, had an additional fund of weird associations to draw upon; so
that spectral legends had already been recognised as fruitful subject-matter for literature.
Charles Brockden Brown had achieved phenomenal fame with his Radcliffian romances, and Washington
Irving’s lighter treatment of eerie themes had quickly become classic. This additional
fund proceeded, as Paul Elmer More has pointed out, from the keen spiritual and theological
interests of the first colonists, plus the strange and forbidding nature of the scene into which
they were plunged. The vast and gloomy virgin forests in whose perpetual twilight all terrors
might well lurk; the hordes of coppery Indians whose strange, saturnine visages and violent
customs hinted strongly at traces of infernal origin; the free rein given under the influence
of Puritan theocracy to all manner of notions respecting man’s relation to the stern and
vengeful God of the Calvinists, and to the sulphureous Adversary of that God, about whom so
much was thundered in the pulpits each Sunday; and the morbid introspection developed by an
isolated backwoods life devoid of normal amusements and of the recreational mood, harassed by
commands for theological self-examination, keyed to unnatural emotional repression, and forming
above all a mere grim struggle for survival—all these things conspired to produce an environment
in which the black whisperings of sinister grandams were heard far beyond the chimney corner,
and in which tales of witchcraft and unbelievable secret monstrosities lingered long after the
dread days of the Salem nightmare.Poe represents the newer, more disillusioned, and more technically finished
of the weird schools that rose out of this propitious milieu. Another school—the tradition
of moral values, gentle restraint, and mild, leisurely phantasy tinged more or less with the
whimsical—was represented by another famous, misunderstood, and lonely figure in American
letters—the shy and sensitive Nathaniel Hawthorne, scion of antique Salem and great-grandson
of one of the bloodiest of the old witchcraft judges. In Hawthorne we have none of the violence,
the daring, the high colouring, the intense dramatic sense, the cosmic malignity, and the undivided
and impersonal artistry of Poe. Here, instead, is a gentle soul cramped by the Puritanism of
early New England; shadowed and wistful, and grieved at an unmoral universe which everywhere
transcends the conventional patterns thought by our forefathers to represent divine and immutable
law. Evil, a very real force to Hawthorne, appears on every hand as a lurking and conquering
adversary; and the visible world becomes in his fancy a theatre of infinite tragedy and woe,
with unseen half-existent influences hovering over it and through it, battling for supremacy
and moulding the destinies of the hapless mortals who form its vain and self-deluded population.
The heritage of American weirdness was his to a most intense degree, and he saw a dismal throng
of vague spectres behind the common phenomena of life; but he was not disinterested enough to
value impressions, sensations, and beauties of narration for their own sake. He must needs weave
his phantasy into some quietly melancholy fabric of didactic or allegorical cast, in which his
meekly resigned cynicism may display with naive moral appraisal the perfidy of a human race
which he cannot cease to cherish and mourn despite his insight into its hypocrisy. Supernatural
horror, then, is never a primary object with Hawthorne; though its impulses were so deeply woven
into his personality that he cannot help suggesting it with the force of genius when he calls
upon the unreal world to illustrate the pensive sermon he wishes to preach.Hawthorne’s intimations of the weird, always gentle, elusive, and restrained,
may be traced throughout his work. The mood that produced them found one delightful vent in
the Teutonised retelling of classic myths for children contained inA Wonder BookandTanglewood Tales,and at other times exercised itself in casting a certain strangeness
and intangible witchery or malevolence over events not meant to be actually supernatural; as
in the macabre posthumous novelDr. Grimshawe’s Secret,which invests with a peculiar
sort of repulsion a house existing to this day in Salem, and abutting on the ancient Charter
Street Burying Ground. InThe Marble Faun,whose design was sketched out in an Italian
villa reputed to be haunted, a tremendous background of genuine phantasy and mystery palpitates
just beyond the common reader’s sight; and glimpses of fabulous blood in mortal veins
are hinted at during the course of a romance which cannot help being interesting despite the
persistent incubus of moral allegory, anti-Popery propaganda, and a Puritan prudery which has
caused the late D. H. Lawrence to express a longing to treat the author in a highly undignified
manner.Septimius Felton,a posthumous novel whose idea was to have been elaborated and
incorporated into the unfinishedDolliver Romance,touches on the Elixir of Life in a
more or less capable fashion; whilst the notes for a never-written tale to be called “The
Ancestral Footstep” shew what Hawthorne would have done with an intensive treatment of
an old English superstition—that of an ancient and accursed line whose members left footprints
of blood as they walked—which appears incidentally in bothSeptimius FeltonandDr. Grimshawe’s Secret.Many of Hawthorne’s shorter tales exhibit weirdness, either of atmosphere
or of incident, to a remarkable degree. “Edward Randolph’s Portrait”, inLegends of the Province House,has its diabolic moments. “The Minister’s Black
Veil” (founded on an actual incident) and “The Ambitious Guest” imply much
more than they state, whilst “Ethan Brand”—a fragment of a longer work never
completed—rises to genuine heights of cosmic fear with its vignette of the wild hill country
and the blazing, desolate lime-kilns, and its delineation of the Byronic “unpardonable
sinner”, whose troubled life ends with a peal of fearful laughter in the night as he seeks
rest amidst the flames of the furnace. Some of Hawthorne’s notes tell of weird tales he
would have written had he lived longer—an especially vivid plot being that concerning
a baffling stranger who appeared now and then in public assemblies, and who was at last followed
and found to come and go from a very ancient grave.But foremost as a finished, artistic unit among all our author’s weird
material is the famous and exquisitely wrought novel,The House of the Seven Gables,in which the relentless working out of an ancestral curse is developed with astonishing power
against the sinister background of a very ancient Salem house—one of those peaked Gothic
affairs which formed the first regular building-up of our New England coast towns, but which
gave way after the seventeenth century to the more familiar gambrel-roofed or classic Georgian
types now known as “Colonial”. Of these old gabled Gothic houses scarcely a dozen
are to be seen today in their original condition throughout the United States, but one well
known to Hawthorne still stands in Turner Street, Salem, and is pointed out with doubtful authority
as the scene and inspiration of the romance. Such an edifice, with its spectral peaks, its clustered
chimneys, its overhanging second story, its grotesque corner-brackets, and its diamond-paned
lattice windows, is indeed an object well calculated to evoke sombre reflections; typifying
as it does the dark Puritan age of concealed horror and witch-whispers which preceded the beauty,
rationality, and spaciousness of the eighteenth century. Hawthorne saw many in his youth, and
knew the black tales connected with some of them. He heard, too, many rumours of a curse upon
his own line as the result of his great-grandfather’s severity as a witchcraft judge in
1692.From this setting came the immortal tale—New England’s greatest
contribution to weird literature—and we can feel in an instant the authenticity of the
atmosphere presented to us. Stealthy horror and disease lurk within the weather-blackened, moss-crusted,
and elm-shadowed walls of the archaic dwelling so vividly displayed, and we grasp the brooding
malignity of the place when we read that its builder—old Colonel Pyncheon—snatched
the land with peculiar ruthlessness from its original settler, Matthew Maule, whom he condemned
to the gallows as a wizard in the year of the panic. Maule died cursing old Pyncheon—“God
will give him blood to drink”—and the waters of the old well on the seized land
turned bitter. Maule’s carpenter son consented to build the great gabled house for his
father’s triumphant enemy, but the old Colonel died strangely on the day of its dedication.
Then followed generations of odd vicissitudes, with queer whispers about the dark powers of
the Maules, and peculiar and sometimes terrible ends befalling the Pyncheons.The overshadowing malevolence of the ancient house—almost as alive as
Poe’s House of Usher, though in a subtler way—pervades the tale as a recurrent motif
pervades an operatic tragedy; and when the main story is reached, we behold the modern Pyncheons
in a pitiable state of decay. Poor old Hepzibah, the eccentric reduced gentlewoman; child-like,
unfortunate Clifford, just released from undeserved imprisonment; sly and treacherous Judge
Pyncheon, who is the old Colonel all over again—all these figures are tremendous symbols,
and are well matched by the stunted vegetation and anaemic fowls in the garden. It was almost
a pity to supply a fairly happy ending, with a union of sprightly Phoebe, cousin and last scion
of the Pyncheons, to the prepossessing young man who turns out to be the last of the Maules.
This union, presumably, ends the curse. Hawthorne avoids all violence of diction or movement,
and keeps his implications of terror well in the background; but occasional glimpses amply serve
to sustain the mood and redeem the work from pure allegorical aridity. Incidents like the bewitching
of Alice Pyncheon in the early eighteenth century, and the spectral music of her harpsichord
which precedes a death in the family—the latter a variant of an immemorial type of Aryan
myth—link the action directly with the supernatural; whilst the dead nocturnal vigil of
old Judge Pyncheon in the ancient parlour, with his frightfully ticking watch, is stark horror
of the most poignant and genuine sort. The way in which the Judge’s death is first adumbrated
by the motions and sniffing of a strange cat outside the window, long before the fact is suspected
either by the reader or by any of the characters, is a stroke of genius which Poe could not
have surpassed. Later the strange cat watches intently outside that same window in the night
and on the next day, for—something. It is clearly the psychopomp of primeval myth, fitted
and adapted with infinite deftness to its latter-day setting.But Hawthorne left no well-defined literary posterity. His mood and attitude
belonged to the age which closed with him, and it is the spirit of Poe—who so clearly
and realistically understood the natural basis of the horror-appeal and the correct mechanics
of its achievement—which survived and blossomed. Among the earliest of Poe’s disciples
may be reckoned the brilliant young Irishman Fitz-James O’Brien (1828–1862), who
became naturalised as an American and perished honourably in the Civil War. It is he who gave
us “What Was It?”, the first well-shaped short story of a tangible but invisible
being, and the prototype of de Maupassant’s “Horla”; he also who created the
inimitable “Diamond Lens”, in which a young microscopist falls in love with a maiden
of an infinitesimal world which he has discovered in a drop of water. O’Brien’s
early death undoubtedly deprived us of some masterful tales of strangeness and terror, though
his genius was not, properly speaking, of the same titan quality which characterised Poe and
Hawthorne.Closer to real greatness was the eccentric and saturnine journalist Ambrose
Bierce, born in 1842; who likewise entered the Civil War, but survived to write some immortal
tales and to disappear in 1913 in as great a cloud of mystery as any he ever evoked from his
nightmare fancy. Bierce was a satirist and pamphleteer of note, but the bulk of his artistic
reputation must rest upon his grim and savage short stories; a large number of which deal with
the Civil War and form the most vivid and realistic expression which that conflict has yet received
in fiction. Virtually all of Bierce’s tales are tales of horror; and whilst many of them
treat only of the physical and psychological horrors within Nature, a substantial proportion
admit the malignly supernatural and form a leading element in America’s fund of weird
literature. Mr. Samuel Loveman, a living poet and critic who was personally acquainted with
Bierce, thus sums up the genius of the great shadow-maker in the preface to some of his letters:“In Bierce, the evocation of horror becomes for the first time, not so
much the prescription or perversion of Poe and Maupassant, but an atmosphere definite and uncannily
precise. Words, so simple that one would be prone to ascribe them to the limitations of a literary
hack, take on an unholy horror, a new and unguessed transformation. In Poe one finds it atour de force,in Maupassant a nervous engagement of the flagellated climax. To Bierce,
simply and sincerely, diabolism held in its tormented depth, a legitimate and reliant means
to the end. Yet a tacit confirmation with Nature is in every instance insisted upon.“In ‘The Death of Halpin Frayser’, flowers, verdure, and
the boughs and leaves of trees are magnificently placed as an opposing foil to unnatural malignity.
Not the accustomed golden world, but a world pervaded with the mystery of blue and the breathless
recalcitrance of dreams, is Bierce’s. Yet, curiously, inhumanity is not altogether
absent.”The “inhumanity” mentioned by Mr. Loveman finds vent in a rare
strain of sardonic comedy and graveyard humour, and a kind of delight in images of cruelty and
tantalising disappointment. The former quality is well illustrated by some of the subtitles
in the darker narratives; such as “One does not always eat what is on the table”,
describing a body laid out for a coroner’s inquest, and “A man though naked may
be in rags”, referring to a frightfully mangled corpse.Bierce’s work is in general somewhat uneven. Many of the stories are
obviously mechanical, and marred by a jaunty and commonplacely artificial style derived from
journalistic models; but the grim malevolence stalking through all of them is unmistakable,
and several stand out as permanent mountain-peaks of American weird writing. “The Death
of Halpin Frayser”, called by Frederic Taber Cooper the most fiendishly ghastly tale in
the literature of the Anglo-Saxon race, tells of a body skulking by night without a soul in
a weird and horribly ensanguined wood, and of a man beset by ancestral memories who met death
at the claws of that which had been his fervently loved mother. “The Damned Thing”,
frequently copied in popular anthologies, chronicles the hideous devastations of an invisible
entity that waddles and flounders on the hills and in the wheatfields by night and day. “The
Suitable Surroundings” evokes with singular subtlety yet apparent simplicity a piercing
sense of the terror which may reside in the written word. In the story the weird author Colston
says to his friend Marsh, “You are brave enough to read me in a street-car, but—in
a deserted house—alone—in the forest—at night! Bah! I have a manuscript in
my pocket that would kill you!” Marsh reads the manuscript in “the suitable surroundings”—and
it does kill him. “The Middle Toe of the Right Foot” is clumsily developed, but
has a powerful climax. A man named Manton has horribly killed his two children and his wife,
the latter of whom lacked the middle toe of the right foot. Ten years later he returns much
altered to the neighbourhood; and, being secretly recognised, is provoked into a bowie-knife
duel in the dark, to be held in the now abandoned house where his crime was committed. When
the moment of the duel arrives a trick is played upon him; and he is left without an antagonist,
shut in a night-black ground floor room of the reputedly haunted edifice, with the thick dust
of a decade on every hand. No knife is drawn against him, for only a thorough scare is intended;
but on the next day he is found crouched in a corner with distorted face, dead of sheer fright
at something he has seen. The only clue visible to the discoverers is one having terrible implications:
“In the dust of years that lay thick upon the floor—leading from the door by which
they had entered, straight across the room to within a yard of Manton’s crouching corpse—were
three parallel lines of footprints—light but definite impressions of bare feet, the outer
ones those of small children, the inner a woman’s. From the point at which they ended
they did not return; they pointed all one way.” And, of course, the woman’s prints
shewed a lack of the middle toe of the right foot. “The Spook House”, told with
a severely homely air of journalistic verisimilitude, conveys terrible hints of shocking mystery.
In 1858 an entire family of seven persons disappears suddenly and unaccountably from a plantation
house in eastern Kentucky, leaving all its possessions untouched—furniture, clothing,
food supplies, horses, cattle, and slaves. About a year later two men of high standing are forced
by a storm to take shelter in the deserted dwelling, and in so doing stumble into a strange
subterranean room lit by an unaccountable greenish light and having an iron door which cannot
be opened from within. In this room lie the decayed corpses of all the missing family; and as
one of the discoverers rushes forward to embrace a body he seems to recognise, the other is
so overpowered by a strange foetor that he accidentally shuts his companion in the vault and
loses consciousness. Recovering his senses six weeks later, the survivor is unable to find the
hidden room; and the house is burned during the Civil War. The imprisoned discoverer is never
seen or heard of again.Bierce seldom realises the atmospheric possibilities of his themes as vividly
as Poe; and much of his work contains a certain touch of naiveté, prosaic angularity,
or early-American provincialism which contrasts somewhat with the efforts of later horror-masters.
Nevertheless the genuineness and artistry of his dark intimations are always unmistakable, so
that his greatness is in no danger of eclipse. As arranged in his definitively collected works,
Bierce’s weird tales occur mainly in two volumes,Can Such Things Be?andIn
the Midst of Life.The former, indeed, is almost wholly given over to the supernatural.Much of the best in American horror-literature has come from pens not mainly
devoted to that medium. Oliver Wendell Holmes’s historicElsie Vennersuggests
with admirable restraint an unnatural ophidian element in a young woman pre-natally influenced,
and sustains the atmosphere with finely discriminating landscape touches. InThe Turn of
the ScrewHenry James triumphs over his inevitable pomposity and prolixity sufficiently
well to create a truly potent air of sinister menace; depicting the hideous influence of two
dead and evil servants, Peter Quint and the governess Miss Jessel, over a small boy and girl
who had been under their care. James is perhaps too diffuse, too unctuously urbane, and too
much addicted to subtleties of speech to realise fully all the wild and devastating horror in
his situations; but for all that there is a rare and mounting tide of fright, culminating in
the death of the little boy, which gives the novelette a permanent place in its special class.F. Marion Crawford produced several weird tales of varying quality, now collected
in a volume entitledWandering Ghosts.“For the Blood Is the Life” touches
powerfully on a case of moon-cursed vampirism near an ancient tower on the rocks of the lonely
South Italian sea-coast. “The Dead Smile” treats of family horrors in an old house
and an ancestral vault in Ireland, and introduces the banshee with considerable force. “The
Upper Berth”, however, is Crawford’s weird masterpiece; and is one of the most tremendous
horror-stories in all literature. In this tale of a suicide-haunted stateroom such things as
the spectral salt-water dampness, the strangely open porthole, and the nightmare struggle with
the nameless object are handled with incomparable dexterity.Very genuine, though not without the typical mannered extravagance of the eighteen-nineties,
is the strain of horror in the early work of Robert W. Chambers, since renowned for products
of a very different quality.The King in Yellow,a series of vaguely connected short
stories having as a background a monstrous and suppressed book whose perusal brings fright,
madness, and spectral tragedy, really achieves notable heights of cosmic fear in spite of uneven
interest and a somewhat trivial and affected cultivation of the Gallic studio atmosphere made
popular by Du Maurier’sTrilby.The most powerful of its tales, perhaps, is “The
Yellow Sign”, in which is introduced a silent and terrible churchyard watchman with a
face like a puffy grave-worm’s. A boy, describing a tussle he has had with this creature,
shivers and sickens as he relates a certain detail. “Well, sir, it’s Gawd’s
truth that when I ’it ’im ’e grabbed me wrists, sir, and when I twisted ’is
soft, mushy fist one of ’is fingers come off in me ’and.” An artist, who after
seeing him has shared with another a strange dream of a nocturnal hearse, is shocked by the
voice with which the watchman accosts him. The fellow emits a muttering sound that fills the
head like thick oily smoke from a fat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome decay. What he mumbles
is merely this: “Have you found the Yellow Sign?”A weirdly hieroglyphed onyx talisman, picked up in the street by the sharer
of his dream, is shortly given the artist; and after stumbling queerly upon the hellish and
forbidden book of horrors the two learn, among other hideous things which no sane mortal should
know, that this talisman is indeed the nameless Yellow Sign handed down from the accursed cult
of Hastur—from primordial Carcosa, whereof the volume treats, and some nightmare memory
of which seems to lurk latent and ominous at the back of all men’s minds. Soon they hear
the rumbling of the black-plumed hearse driven by the flabby and corpse-faced watchman. He enters
the night-shrouded house in quest of the Yellow Sign, all bolts and bars rotting at his touch.
And when the people rush in, drawn by a scream that no human throat could utter, they find three
forms on the floor—two dead and one dying. One of the dead shapes is far gone in decay.
It is the churchyard watchman, and the doctor exclaims, “That man must have been dead
for months.” It is worth observing that the author derives most of the names and allusions
connected with his eldritch land of primal memory from the tales of Ambrose Bierce. Other early
works of Mr. Chambers displaying the outré and macabre element areThe Maker of MoonsandIn Search of the Unknown.One cannot help regretting that he did not further develop
a vein in which he could so easily have become a recognised master.Horror material of authentic force may be found in the work of the New England
realist Mary E. Wilkins; whose volume of short tales,The Wind in the Rose-Bush,contains
a number of noteworthy achievements. In “The Shadows on the Wall” we are shewn with
consummate skill the response of a staid New England household to uncanny tragedy; and the sourceless
shadow of the poisoned brother well prepares us for the climactic moment when the shadow of
the secret murderer, who has killed himself in a neighbouring city, suddenly appears beside
it. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in “The Yellow Wall Paper”, rises to a classic level
in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered
room where a madwoman was once confined.In “The Dead Valley” the eminent architect and mediaevalist Ralph
Adams Cram achieves a memorably potent degree of vague regional horror through subtleties of
atmosphere and description.Still further carrying on our spectral tradition is the gifted and versatile
humourist Irvin S. Cobb, whose work both early and recent contains some finely weird specimens.
“Fishhead”, an early achievement, is banefully effective in its portrayal of unnatural
affinities between a hybrid idiot and the strange fish of an isolated lake, which at the last
avenge their biped kinsman’s murder. Later work of Mr. Cobb introduces an element of possible
science, as in the tale of hereditary memory where a modern man with a negroid strain utters
words in African jungle speech when run down by a train under visual and aural circumstances
recalling the maiming of his black ancestor by a rhinoceros a century before.Extremely high in artistic stature is the novelThe Dark Chamber(1927),
by the late Leonard Cline. This is the tale of a man who—with the characteristic ambition
of the Gothic or Byronic hero-villain—seeks to defy Nature and recapture every moment
of his past life through the abnormal stimulation of memory. To this end he employs endless
notes, records, mnemonic objects, and pictures—and finally odours, music, and exotic drugs.
At last his ambition goes beyond his personal life and reaches toward the black abysses ofhereditarymemory—even back to pre-human days amidst the steaming swamps of the Carboniferous
age, and to still more unimaginable deeps of primal time and entity. He calls for madder music
and takes stronger drugs, and finally his great dog grows oddly afraid of him. A noxious animal
stench encompasses him, and he grows vacant-faced and sub-human. In the end he takes to the
woods, howling at night beneath windows. He is finally found in a thicket, mangled to death.
Beside him is the mangled corpse of his dog. They have killed each other. The atmosphere of
this novel is malevolently potent, much attention being paid to the central figure’s sinister
home and household.A less subtle and well-balanced but nevertheless highly effective creation
is Herbert S. Gorman’s novel,The Place Called Dagon,which relates the dark history
of a western Massachusetts backwater where the descendants of refugees from the Salem witchcraft
still keep alive the morbid and degenerate horrors of the Black Sabbat.Sinister House,by Leland Hall, has touches of magnificent atmosphere
but is marred by a somewhat mediocre romanticism.Very notable in their way are some of the weird conceptions of the novelist
and short-story writer Edward Lucas White, most of whose themes arise from actual dreams. “The
Song of the Sirens” has a very pervasive strangeness, while such things as “Lukundoo”
and “The Snout” rouse darker apprehensions. Mr. White imparts a very peculiar quality
to his tales—an oblique sort of glamour which has its own distinctive type of convincingness.Of younger Americans, none strikes the note of cosmic terror so well as the
California poet, artist, and fictionist Clark Ashton Smith, whose bizarre writings, drawings,
paintings, and stories are the delight of a sensitive few. Mr. Smith has for his background
a universe of remote and paralysing fright—jungles of poisonous and iridescent blossoms
on the moons of Saturn, evil and grotesque temples in Atlantis, Lemuria, and forgotten elder
worlds, and dank morasses of spotted death-fungi in spectral countries beyond earth’s
rim. His longest and most ambitious poem,The Hashish-Eater,is in pentameter blank verse;
and opens up chaotic and incredible vistas of kaleidoscopic nightmare in the spaces between
the stars. In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Mr. Smith is perhaps unexcelled
by any other writer dead or living. Who else has seen such gorgeous, luxuriant, and feverishly
distorted visions of infinite spheres and multiple dimensions and lived to tell the tale? His
short stories deal powerfully with other galaxies, worlds, and dimensions, as well as with strange
regions and aeons on the earth. He tells of primal Hyperborea and its black amorphous god Tsathoggua;
of the lost continent Zothique, and of the fabulous, vampire-curst land of Averoigne in mediaeval
France. Some of Mr. Smith’s best work can be found in the brochure entitledThe Double
Shadow and Other Fantasies(1933).IX. The Weird Tradition in the British IslesRecent British literature, besides including the three or four greatest fantaisistes
of the present age, has been gratifyingly fertile in the element of the weird. Rudyard Kipling
has often approached it; and has, despite the omnipresent mannerisms, handled it with indubitable
mastery in such tales as “The Phantom ’Rickshaw”, “‘The Finest
Story in the World’”, “The Recrudescence of Imray”, and “The
Mark of the Beast”. This latter is of particular poignancy; the pictures of the naked
leper-priest who mewed like an otter, of the spots which appeared on the chest of the man that
priest cursed, of the growing carnivorousness of the victim and of the fear which horses began
to display toward him, and of the eventually half-accomplished transformation of that victim
into a leopard, being things which no reader is ever likely to forget. The final defeat of the
malignant sorcery does not impair the force of the tale or the validity of its mystery.Lafcadio Hearn, strange, wandering, and exotic, departs still farther from
the realm of the real; and with the supreme artistry of a sensitive poet weaves phantasies impossible
to an author of the solid roast-beef type. HisFantastics,written in America, contains
some of the most impressive ghoulishness in all literature; whilst hisKwaidan,written
in Japan, crystallises with matchless skill and delicacy the eerie lore and whispered legends
of that richly colourful nation. Still more of Hearn’s weird wizardry of language is shewn
in some of his translations from the French, especially from Gautier and Flaubert. His version
of the latter’sTemptation of St. Anthonyis a classic of fevered and riotous imagery
clad in the magic of singing words.Oscar Wilde may likewise be given a place amongst weird writers, both for certain
of his exquisite fairy tales, and for his vividPicture of Dorian Gray,in which a marvellous
portrait for years assumes the duty of ageing and coarsening instead of its original, who meanwhile
plunges into every excess of vice and crime without the outward loss of youth, beauty, and freshness.
There is a sudden and potent climax when Dorian Gray, at last become a murderer, seeks to destroy
the painting whose changes testify to his moral degeneracy. He stabs it with a knife, and a
hideous cry and crash are heard; but when the servants enter they find it in all its pristine
loveliness. “Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his
heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined
the rings that they recognised who it was.”Matthew Phipps Shiel, author of many weird, grotesque, and adventurous novels
and tales, occasionally attains a high level of horrific magic. “Xélucha”
is a noxiously hideous fragment, but is excelled by Mr. Shiel’s undoubted masterpiece,
“The House of Sounds”, floridly written in the “yellow ’nineties”,
and re-cast with more artistic restraint in the early twentieth century. This story, in final
form, deserves a place among the foremost things of its kind. It tells of a creeping horror
and menace trickling down the centuries on a sub-arctic island off the coast of Norway; where,
amidst the sweep of daemon winds and the ceaseless din of hellish waves and cataracts, a vengeful
dead man built a brazen tower of terror. It is vaguely like, yet infinitely unlike, Poe’s
“Fall of the House of Usher”. In the novelThe Purple CloudMr. Shiel describes
with tremendous power a curse which came out of the arctic to destroy mankind, and which for
a time appears to have left but a single inhabitant on our planet. The sensations of this lone
survivor as he realises his position, and roams through the corpse-littered and treasure-strown
cities of the world as their absolute master, are delivered with a skill and artistry falling
little short of actual majesty. Unfortunately the second half of the book, with its conventionally
romantic element, involves a distinct “letdown”.Better known than Shiel is the ingenious Bram Stoker, who created many starkly
horrific conceptions in a series of novels whose poor technique sadly impairs their net effect.The Lair of the White Worm,dealing with a gigantic primitive entity that lurks in a
vault beneath an ancient castle, utterly ruins a magnificent idea by a development almost infantile.The Jewel of Seven Stars,touching on a strange Egyptian resurrection, is less crudely
written. But best of all is the famousDracula,which has become almost the standard
modern exploitation of the frightful vampire myth. Count Dracula, a vampire, dwells in a horrible
castle in the Carpathians; but finally migrates to England with the design of populating the
country with fellow vampires. How an Englishman fares within Dracula’s stronghold of terrors,
and how the dead fiend’s plot for domination is at last defeated, are elements which unite
to form a tale now justly assigned a permanent place in English letters.Draculaevoked
many similar novels of supernatural horror, among which the best are perhapsThe Beetle,by Richard Marsh,Brood of the Witch-Queen,by “Sax Rohmer” (Arthur Sarsfield
Ward), andThe Door of the Unreal,by Gerald Biss. The latter handles quite dexterously
the standard werewolf superstition. Much subtler and more artistic, and told with singular skill
through the juxtaposed narratives of the several characters, is the novelCold Harbour,by Francis Brett Young, in which an ancient house of strange malignancy is powerfully delineated.
The mocking and well-nigh omnipotent fiend Humphrey Furnival holds echoes of the Manfred-Montoni
type of early Gothic “villain”, but is redeemed from triteness by many clever individualities.
Only the slight diffuseness of explanation at the close, and the somewhat too free use of divination
as a plot factor, keep this tale from approaching absolute perfection.In the novelWitch WoodJohn Buchan depicts with tremendous force a
survival of the evil Sabbat in a lonely district of Scotland. The description of the black forest
with the evil stone, and of the terrible cosmic adumbrations when the horror is finally extirpated,
will repay one for wading through the very gradual action and plethora of Scottish dialect.
Some of Mr. Buchan’s short stories are also extremely vivid in their spectral intimations;
“The Green Wildebeest”, a tale of African witchcraft, “The Wind in the Portico”,
with its awakening of dead Britanno-Roman horrors, and “Skule Skerry”, with its
touches of sub-arctic fright, being especially remarkable.Clemence Housman, in the brief novelette “The Were-wolf”, attains
a high degree of gruesome tension and achieves to some extent the atmosphere of authentic folklore.
InThe Elixir of LifeArthur Ransome attains some darkly excellent effects despite a
general naiveté of plot, while H. B. Drake’sThe Shadowy Thingsummons up
strange and terrible vistas. George Macdonald’sLilithhas a compelling bizarrerie
all its own; the first and simpler of the two versions being perhaps the more effective.Deserving of distinguished notice as a forceful craftsman to whom an unseen
mystic world is ever a close and vital reality is the poet Walter de la Mare, whose haunting
verse and exquisite prose alike bear consistent traces of a strange vision reaching deeply into
veiled spheres of beauty and terrible and forbidden dimensions of being. In the novelThe
Returnwe see the soul of a dead man reach out of its grave of two centuries and fasten
itself upon the flesh of the living, so that even the face of the victim becomes that which
had long ago returned to dust. Of the shorter tales, of which several volumes exist, many are
unforgettable for their command of fear’s and sorcery’s darkest ramifications; notably
“Seaton’s Aunt”, in which there lowers a noxious background of malignant vampirism;
“The Tree”, which tells of a frightful vegetable growth in the yard of a starving
artist; “Out of the Deep”, wherein we are given leave to imagine what thing answered
the summons of a dying wastrel in a dark lonely house when he pulled a long-feared bell-cord
in the attic chamber of his dread-haunted boyhood; “A Recluse”, which hints at
what sent a chance guest flying from a house in the night; “Mr. Kempe”, which shews
us a mad clerical hermit in quest of the human soul, dwelling in a frightful sea-cliff region
beside an archaic abandoned chapel; and “All-Hallows”, a glimpse of daemoniac forces
besieging a lonely mediaeval church and miraculously restoring the rotting masonry. De la Mare
does not make fear the sole or even the dominant element of most of his tales, being apparently
more interested in the subtleties of character involved. Occasionally he sinks to sheer whimsical
phantasy of the Barrie order. Still, he is among the very few to whom unreality is a vivid,
living presence; and as such he is able to put into his occasional fear-studies a keen potency
which only a rare master can achieve. His poem “The Listeners” restores the Gothic
shudder to modern verse.The weird short story has fared well of late, an important contributor being
the versatile E. F. Benson, whose “The Man Who Went Too Far” breathes whisperingly
of a house at the edge of a dark wood, and of Pan’s hoof-mark on the breast of a dead
man. Mr. Benson’s volume,Visible and Invisible,contains several stories of singular
power; notably“Negotium Perambulans”,whose unfolding reveals an abnormal
monster from an ancient ecclesiastical panel which performs an act of miraculous vengeance in
a lonely village on the Cornish coast, and “The Horror-Horn”, through which lopes
a terrible half-human survival dwelling on unvisited Alpine peaks. “The Face”,
in another collection, is lethally potent in its relentless aura of doom. H. R. Wakefield, in
his collectionsThey Return at EveningandOthers Who Return,manages now and
then to achieve great heights of horror despite a vitiating air of sophistication. The most
notable stories are “The Red Lodge” with its slimy aqueous evil, “‘He
Cometh and He Passeth By’”, “‘And He Shall Sing . . .’”,
“The Cairn”, “‘Look Up There!’”, “Blind Man’s
Buff”, and that bit of lurking millennial horror, “The Seventeenth Hole at Duncaster”.
Mention has been made of the weird work of H. G. Wells and A. Conan Doyle. The former, in “The
Ghost of Fear”, reaches a very high level; while all the items inThirty Strange Storieshave strong fantastic implications. Doyle now and then struck a powerfully spectral note, as
in “The Captain of the ‘Pole-Star’”, a tale of arctic ghostliness,
and “Lot No. 249”, wherein the reanimated mummy theme is used with more than ordinary
skill. Hugh Walpole, of the same family as the founder of Gothic fiction, has sometimes approached
the bizarre with much success; his short story “Mrs. Lunt” carrying a very poignant
shudder. John Metcalfe, in the collection published asThe Smoking Leg,attains now
and then a rare pitch of potency; the tale entitled “The Bad Lands” containing graduations
of horror that strongly savour of genius. More whimsical and inclined toward the amiable and
innocuous phantasy of Sir J. M. Barrie are the short tales of E. M. Forster, grouped under the
title ofThe Celestial Omnibus.Of these only one, dealing with a glimpse of Pan and
his aura of fright, may be said to hold the true element of cosmic horror. Mrs. H. D. Everett,
though adhering to very old and conventional models, occasionally reaches singular heights of
spiritual terror in her collection of short stories. L. P. Hartley is notable for his incisive
and extremely ghastly tale, “A Visitor from Down Under”. May Sinclair’sUncanny Storiescontain more of traditional occultism than of that creative treatment of
fear which marks mastery in this field, and are inclined to lay more stress on human emotions
and psychological delving than upon the stark phenomena of a cosmos utterly unreal. It may be
well to remark here that occult believers are probably less effective than materialists in delineating
the spectral and the fantastic, since to them the phantom world is so commonplace a reality
that they tend to refer to it with less awe, remoteness, and impressiveness than do those who
see in it an absolute and stupendous violation of the natural order.Of rather uneven stylistic quality, but vast occasional power in its suggestion
of lurking worlds and beings behind the ordinary surface of life, is the work of William Hope
Hodgson, known today far less than it deserves to be. Despite a tendency toward conventionally
sentimental conceptions of the universe, and of man’s relation to it and to his fellows,
Mr. Hodgson is perhaps second only to Algernon Blackwood in his serious treatment of unreality.
Few can equal him in adumbrating the nearness of nameless forces and monstrous besieging entities
through casual hints and insignificant details, or in conveying feelings of the spectral and
the abnormal in connexion with regions or buildings.InThe Boats of the “Glen Carrig”(1907) we are shewn a
variety of malign marvels and accursed unknown lands as encountered by the survivors of a sunken
ship. The brooding menace in the earlier parts of the book is impossible to surpass, though
a letdown in the direction of ordinary romance and adventure occurs toward the end. An inaccurate
and pseudo-romantic attempt to reproduce eighteenth-century prose detracts from the general
effect, but the really profound nautical erudition everywhere displayed is a compensating factor.The House on the Borderland(1908)—perhaps the greatest of all
Mr. Hodgson’s works—tells of a lonely and evilly regarded house in Ireland which
forms a focus for hideous other-world forces and sustains a siege by blasphemous hybrid anomalies
from a hidden abyss below. The wanderings of the narrator’s spirit through limitless light-years
of cosmic space and kalpas of eternity, and its witnessing of the solar system’s final
destruction, constitute something almost unique in standard literature. And everywhere there
is manifest the author’s power to suggest vague, ambushed horrors in natural scenery.
But for a few touches of commonplace sentimentality this book would be a classic of the first
water.The Ghost Pirates(1909), regarded by Mr. Hodgson as rounding out a
trilogy with the two previously mentioned works, is a powerful account of a doomed and haunted
ship on its last voyage, and of the terrible sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps
the spirits of bygone buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to an unknown fate.
With its command of maritime knowledge, and its clever selection of hints and incidents suggestive
of latent horrors in Nature, this book at times reaches enviable peaks of power.The Night Land(1912) is a long-extended (583 pp.) tale of the earth’s
infinitely remote future—billions of billions of years ahead, after the death of the sun.
It is told in a rather clumsy fashion, as the dreams of a man in the seventeenth century, whose
mind merges with its own future incarnation; and is seriously marred by painful verboseness,
repetitiousness, artificial and nauseously sticky romantic sentimentality, and an attempt at
archaic language even more grotesque and absurd than that in“Glen Carrig”.Allowing for all its faults, it is yet one of the most potent pieces of macabre
imagination ever written. The picture of a night-black, dead planet, with the remains of the
human race concentrated in a stupendously vast metal pyramid and besieged by monstrous, hybrid,
and altogether unknown forces of the darkness, is something that no reader can ever forget.
Shapes and entities of an altogether non-human and inconceivable sort—the prowlers of
the black, man-forsaken, and unexplored world outside the pyramid—aresuggestedandpartlydescribed with ineffable potency; while the night-bound landscape with its
chasms and slopes and dying volcanism takes on an almost sentient terror beneath the author’s
touch.Midway in the book the central figure ventures outside the pyramid on a quest
through death-haunted realms untrod by man for millions of years—and in his slow, minutely
described, day-by-day progress over unthinkable leagues of immemorial blackness there is a sense
of cosmic alienage, breathless mystery, and terrified expectancy unrivalled in the whole range
of literature. The last quarter of the book drags woefully, but fails to spoil the tremendous
power of the whole.Mr. Hodgson’s later volume,Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder,consists
of several longish short stories published many years before in magazines. In quality it falls
conspicuously below the level of the other books. We here find a more or less conventional stock
figure of the “infallible detective” type—the progeny of M. Dupin and Sherlock
Holmes, and the close kin of Algernon Blackwood’s John Silence—moving through scenes
and events badly marred by an atmosphere of professional “occultism”. A few of the
episodes, however, are of undeniable power; and afford glimpses of the peculiar genius characteristic
of the author.Naturally it is impossible in a brief sketch to trace out all the classic modern
uses of the terror element. The ingredient must of necessity enter into all work both prose
and verse treating broadly of life; and we are therefore not surprised to find a share in such
writers as the poet Browning, whose “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came” is instinct
with hideous menace, or the novelist Joseph Conrad, who often wrote of the dark secrets within
the sea, and of the daemoniac driving power of Fate as influencing the lives of lonely and maniacally
resolute men. Its trail is one of infinite ramifications; but we must here confine ourselves
to its appearance in a relatively unmixed state, where it determines and dominates the work
of art containing it.Somewhat separate from the main British stream is that current of weirdness
in Irish literature which came to the fore in the Celtic Renaissance of the later nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. Ghost and fairy lore have always been of great prominence in
Ireland, and for over an hundred years have been recorded by a line of such faithful transcribers
and translators as William Carleton, T. Crofton Croker, Lady Wilde—mother of Oscar Wilde—Douglas
Hyde, and W. B. Yeats. Brought to notice by the modern movement, this body of myth has been
carefully collected and studied; and its salient features reproduced in the work of later figures
like Yeats, J. M. Synge, “A. E.”, Lady Gregory, Padraic Colum, James Stephens, and
their colleagues.Whilst on the whole more whimsically fantastic than terrible, such folklore
and its consciously artistic counterparts contain much that falls truly within the domain of
cosmic horror. Tales of burials in sunken churches beneath haunted lakes, accounts of death-heralding
banshees and sinister changelings, ballads of spectres and “the unholy creatures of the
raths”—all these have their poignant and definite shivers, and mark a strong and
distinctive element in weird literature. Despite homely grotesqueness and absolute naiveté,
there is genuine nightmare in the class of narrative represented by the yarn of Teig O’Kane,
who in punishment for his wild life was ridden all night by a hideous corpse that demanded burial
and drove him from churchyard to churchyard as the dead rose up loathsomely in each one and
refused to accommodate the newcomer with a berth. Yeats, undoubtedly the greatest figure of
the Irish revival if not the greatest of all living poets, has accomplished notable things both
in original work and in the codification of old legends.X. The Modern MastersThe best horror-tales of today, profiting by the long evolution of the type,
possess a naturalness, convincingness, artistic smoothness, and skilful intensity of appeal
quite beyond comparison with anything in the Gothic work of a century or more ago. Technique,
craftsmanship, experience, and psychological knowledge have advanced tremendously with the passing
years, so that much of the older work seems naive and artificial; redeemed, when redeemed at
all, only by a genius which conquers heavy limitations. The tone of jaunty and inflated romance,
full of false motivation and investing every conceivable event with a counterfeit significance
and carelessly inclusive glamour, is now confined to lighter and more whimsical phases of supernatural
writing. Serious weird stories are either made realistically intense by close consistency and
perfect fidelity to Nature except in the one supernatural direction which the author allows
himself, or else cast altogether in the realm of phantasy, with atmosphere cunningly adapted
to the visualisation of a delicately exotic world of unreality beyond space and time, in which
almost anything may happen if it but happen in true accord with certain types of imagination
and illusion normal to the sensitive human brain. This, at least, is the dominant tendency;
though of course many great contemporary writers slip occasionally into some of the flashy postures
of immature romanticism, or into bits of the equally empty and absurd jargon of pseudo-scientific
“occultism”, now at one of its periodic high tides.Of living creators of cosmic fear raised to its most artistic pitch, few if
any can hope to equal the versatile Arthur Machen; author of some dozen tales long and short,
in which the elements of hidden horror and brooding fright attain an almost incomparable substance
and realistic acuteness. Mr. Machen, a general man of letters and master of an exquisitely lyrical
and expressive prose style, has perhaps put more conscious effort into his picaresqueChronicle
of Clemendy,his refreshing essays, his vivid autobiographical volumes, his fresh and spirited
translations, and above all his memorable epic of the sensitive aesthetic mind,The Hill
of Dreams,in which the youthful hero responds to the magic of that ancient Welsh environment
which is the author’s own, and lives a dream-life in the Roman city of Isca Silurum, now
shrunk to the relic-strown village of Caerleon-on-Usk. But the fact remains that his powerful
horror-material of the ’nineties and earlier nineteen-hundreds stands alone in its class,
and marks a distinct epoch in the history of this literary form.Mr. Machen, with an impressionable Celtic heritage linked to keen youthful
memories of the wild domed hills, archaic forests, and cryptical Roman ruins of the Gwent countryside,
has developed an imaginative life of rare beauty, intensity, and historic background. He has
absorbed the mediaeval mystery of dark woods and ancient customs, and is a champion of the Middle
Ages in all things—including the Catholic faith. He has yielded, likewise, to the spell
of the Britanno-Roman life which once surged over his native region; and finds strange magic
in the fortified camps, tessellated pavements, fragments of statues, and kindred things which
tell of the day when classicism reigned and Latin was the language of the country. A young American
poet, Frank Belknap Long, Jun., has well summarised this dreamer’s rich endowments and
wizardry of expression in the sonnet “On Reading Arthur Machen”:“There is a glory in the autumn wood;The ancient lanes of England wind and climbPast wizard oaks and gorse and tangled thymeTo where a fort of mighty empire stood:There is a glamour in the autumn sky;The reddened clouds are writhing in the glowOf some great fire, and there are glints belowOf tawny yellow where the embers die.I wait, for he will show me, clear and cold,High-rais’d in splendour, sharp against the North,The Roman eagles, and thro’ mists of goldThe marching legions as they issue forth:I wait, for I would share with him againThe ancient wisdom, and the ancient pain.”Of Mr. Machen’s horror-tales the most famous is perhaps “The Great
God Pan” (1894), which tells of a singular and terrible experiment and its consequences.
A young woman, through surgery of the brain-cells, is made to see the vast and monstrous deity
of Nature, and becomes an idiot in consequence, dying less than a year later. Years afterward
a strange, ominous, and foreign-looking child named Helen Vaughan is placed to board with a
family in rural Wales, and haunts the woods in unaccountable fashion. A little boy is thrown
out of his mind at sight of someone or something he spies with her, and a young girl comes to
a terrible end in similar fashion. All this mystery is strangely interwoven with the Roman rural
deities of the place, as sculptured in antique fragments. After another lapse of years, a woman
of strangely exotic beauty appears in society, drives her husband to horror and death, causes
an artist to paint unthinkable paintings of Witches’ Sabbaths, creates an epidemic of
suicide among the men of her acquaintance, and is finally discovered to be a frequenter of the
lowest dens of vice in London, where even the most callous degenerates are shocked at her enormities.
Through the clever comparing of notes on the part of those who have had word of her at various
stages of her career, this woman is discovered to be the girl Helen Vaughan; who is the child—by
no mortal father—of the young woman on whom the brain experiment was made. She is a daughter
of hideous Pan himself, and at the last is put to death amidst horrible transmutations of form
involving changes of sex and a descent to the most primal manifestations of the life-principle.But the charm of the tale is in the telling. No one could begin to describe
the cumulative suspense and ultimate horror with which every paragraph abounds without following
fully the precise order in which Mr. Machen unfolds his gradual hints and revelations. Melodrama
is undeniably present, and coincidence is stretched to a length which appears absurd upon analysis;
but in the malign witchery of the tale as a whole these trifles are forgotten, and the sensitive
reader reaches the end with only an appreciative shudder and a tendency to repeat the words
of one of the characters: “It is too incredible, too monstrous; such things can never
be in this quiet world. . . . Why, man, if such a case were possible, our earth would be a nightmare.”Less famous and less complex in plot than “The Great God Pan”,
but definitely finer in atmosphere and general artistic value, is the curious and dimly disquieting
chronicle called “The White People”, whose central portion purports to be the diary
or notes of a little girl whose nurse has introduced her to some of the forbidden magic and
soul-blasting traditions of the noxious witch-cult—the cult whose whispered lore was handed
down long lines of peasantry throughout Western Europe, and whose members sometimes stole forth
at night, one by one, to meet in black woods and lonely places for the revolting orgies of the
Witches’ Sabbath. Mr. Machen’s narrative, a triumph of skilful selectiveness and
restraint, accumulates enormous power as it flows on in a stream of innocent childish prattle;
introducing allusions to strange “nymphs”, “Dôls”, “voolas”,
“White, Green, and Scarlet Ceremonies”, “Aklo letters”, “Chian
language”, “Mao games”, and the like. The rites learned by the nurse from
her witch grandmother are taught to the child by the time she is three years old, and her artless
accounts of the dangerous secret revelations possess a lurking terror generously mixed with
pathos. Evil charms well known to anthropologists are described with juvenile naiveté,
and finally there comes a winter afternoon journey into the old Welsh hills, performed under
an imaginative spell which lends to the wild scenery an added weirdness, strangeness, and suggestion
of grotesque sentience. The details of this journey are given with marvellous vividness, and
form to the keen critic a masterpiece of fantastic writing, with almost unlimited power in the
intimation of potent hideousness and cosmic aberration. At length the child—whose age
is then thirteen—comes upon a cryptic and banefully beautiful thing in the midst of a
dark and inaccessible wood. She flees in awe, but is permanently altered and repeatedly revisits
the wood. In the end horror overtakes her in a manner deftly prefigured by an anecdote in the
prologue, but she poisons herself in time. Like the mother of Helen Vaughan in The Great God
Pan, she has seen that frightful deity. She is discovered dead in the dark wood beside the cryptic
thing she found; and that thing—a whitely luminous statue of Roman workmanship about which
dire mediaeval rumours had clustered—is affrightedly hammered into dust by the searchers.In the episodic novel ofThe Three Impostors,a work whose merit as
a whole is somewhat marred by an imitation of the jaunty Stevenson manner, occur certain tales
which perhaps represent the high-water mark of Machen’s skill as a terror-weaver. Here
we find in its most artistic form a favourite weird conception of the author’s; the notion
that beneath the mounds and rocks of the wild Welsh hills dwell subterraneously that squat primitive
race whose vestiges gave rise to our common folk legends of fairies, elves, and the “little
people”, and whose acts are even now responsible for certain unexplained disappearances,
and occasional substitutions of strange dark “changelings” for normal infants. This
theme receives its finest treatment in the episode entitled “The Novel of the Black Seal”;
where a professor, having discovered a singular identity between certain characters scrawled
on Welsh limestone rocks and those existing in a prehistoric black seal from Babylon, sets out
on a course of discovery which leads him to unknown and terrible things. A queer passage in
the ancient geographer Solinus, a series of mysterious disappearances in the lonely reaches
of Wales, a strange idiot son born to a rural mother after a fright in which her inmost faculties
were shaken; all these things suggest to the professor a hideous connexion and a condition revolting
to any friend and respecter of the human race. He hires the idiot boy, who jabbers strangely
at times in a repulsive hissing voice, and is subject to odd epileptic seizures. Once, after
such a seizure in the professor’s study by night, disquieting odours and evidences of
unnatural presences are found; and soon after that the professor leaves a bulky document and
goes into the weird hills with feverish expectancy and strange terror in his heart. He never
returns, but beside a fantastic stone in the wild country are found his watch, money, and ring,
done up with catgut in a parchment bearing the same terrible characters as those on the black
Babylonish seal and the rock in the Welsh mountains.The bulky document explains enough to bring up the most hideous vistas. Professor
Gregg, from the massed evidence presented by the Welsh disappearances, the rock inscription,
the accounts of ancient geographers, and the black seal, has decided that a frightful race of
dark primal beings of immemorial antiquity and wide former diffusion still dwells beneath the
hills of unfrequented Wales. Further research has unriddled the message of the black seal, and
proved that the idiot boy, a son of some father more terrible than mankind, is the heir of monstrous
memories and possibilities. That strange night in the study the professor invoked ‘the
awful transmutation of the hills’ by the aid of the black seal, and aroused in the hybrid
idiot the horrors of his shocking paternity. He “saw his body swell and become distended
as a bladder, while the face blackened. . . .” And then the supreme effects of the invocation
appeared, and Professor Gregg knew the stark frenzy of cosmic panic in its darkest form. He
knew the abysmal gulfs of abnormality that he had opened, and went forth into the wild hills
prepared and resigned. He would meet the unthinkable ‘Little People’—and his
document ends with a rational observation: “If I unhappily do not return from my journey,
there is no need to conjure up here a picture of the awfulness of my fate.”Also inThe Three Impostorsis the “Novel of the White Powder”,
which approaches the absolute culmination of loathsome fright. Francis Leicester, a young law
student nervously worn out by seclusion and overwork, has a prescription filled by an old apothecary
none too careful about the state of his drugs. The substance, it later turns out, is an unusual
salt which time and varying temperature have accidentally changed to something very strange
and terrible; nothing less, in short, than the mediaevalVinum Sabbati,whose consumption
at the horrible orgies of the Witches’ Sabbath gave rise to shocking transformations and—if
injudiciously used—to unutterable consequences. Innocently enough, the youth regularly
imbibes the powder in a glass of water after meals; and at first seems substantially benefited.
Gradually, however, his improved spirits take the form of dissipation; he is absent from home
a great deal, and appears to have undergone a repellent psychological change. One day an odd
livid spot appears on his right hand, and he afterward returns to his seclusion; finally keeping
himself shut within his room and admitting none of the household. The doctor calls for an interview,
and departs in a palsy of horror, saying that he can do no more in that house. Two weeks later
the patient’s sister, walking outside, sees a monstrous thing at the sickroom window;
and servants report that food left at the locked door is no longer touched. Summons at the door
bring only a sound of shuffling and a demand in a thick gurgling voice to be let alone. At last
an awful happening is reported by a shuddering housemaid. The ceiling of the room below Leicester’s
is stained with a hideous black fluid, and a pool of viscid abomination has dripped to the bed
beneath. Dr. Haberden, now persuaded to return to the house, breaks down the young man’s
door and strikes again and again with an iron bar at the blasphemous semi-living thing he finds
there. It is “a dark and putrid mass, seething with corruption and hideous rottenness,
neither liquid nor solid, but melting and changing”. Burning points like eyes shine out
of its midst, and before it is despatched it tries to lift what might have been an arm. Soon
afterward the physician, unable to endure the memory of what he has beheld, dies at sea while
bound for a new life in America.Mr. Machen returns to the daemoniac “Little People” in “The
Red Hand” and “The Shining Pyramid”; and inThe Terror,a wartime story,
he treats with very potent mystery the effect of man’s modern repudiation of spirituality
on the beasts of the world, which are thus led to question his supremacy and to unite for his
extermination. Of utmost delicacy, and passing from mere horror into true mysticism, isThe
Great Return,a story of the Graal, also a product of the war period. Too well known to
need description here is the tale of “The Bowmen”; which, taken for authentic narration,
gave rise to the widespread legend of the “Angels of Mons”—ghosts of the old
English archers of Crécy and Agincourt who fought in 1914 beside the hard-pressed ranks
of England’s glorious “Old Contemptibles”.Less intense than Mr. Machen in delineating the extremes of stark fear, yet
infinitely more closely wedded to the idea of an unreal world constantly pressing upon ours,
is the inspired and prolific Algernon Blackwood, amidst whose voluminous and uneven work may
be found some of the finest spectral literature of this or any age. Of the quality of Mr. Blackwood’s
genius there can be no dispute; for no one has even approached the skill, seriousness, and minute
fidelity with which he records the overtones of strangeness in ordinary things and experiences,
or the preternatural insight with which he builds up detail by detail the complete sensations
and perceptions leading from reality into supernormal life or vision. Without notable command
of the poetic witchery of mere words, he is the one absolute and unquestioned master of weird
atmosphere; and can evoke what amounts almost to a story from a simple fragment of humourless
psychological description. Above all others he understands how fully some sensitive minds dwell
forever on the borderland of dream, and how relatively slight is the distinction betwixt those
images formed from actual objects and those excited by the play of the imagination.Mr. Blackwood’s lesser work is marred by several defects such as ethical
didacticism, occasional insipid whimsicality, the flatness of benignant supernaturalism, and
a too free use of the trade jargon of modern “occultism”. A fault of his more serious
efforts is that diffuseness and long-windedness which results from an excessively elaborate
attempt, under the handicap of a somewhat bald and journalistic style devoid of intrinsic magic,
colour, and vitality, to visualise precise sensations and nuances of uncanny suggestion. But
in spite of all this, the major products of Mr. Blackwood attain a genuinely classic level,
and evoke as does nothing else in literature an awed and convinced sense of the immanence of
strange spiritual spheres or entities.The well-nigh endless array of Mr. Blackwood’s fiction includes both
novels and shorter tales, the latter sometimes independent and sometimes arrayed in series.
Foremost of all must be reckoned “The Willows”, in which the nameless presences
on a desolate Danube island are horribly felt and recognised by a pair of idle voyagers. Here
art and restraint in narrative reach their very highest development, and an impression of lasting
poignancy is produced without a single strained passage or a single false note. Another amazingly
potent though less artistically finished tale is “The Wendigo”, where we are confronted
by horrible evidences of a vast forest daemon about which North Woods lumbermen whisper at evening.
The manner in which certain footprints tell certain unbelievable things is really a marked triumph
in craftsmanship. In “An Episode in a Lodging House” we behold frightful presences
summoned out of black space by a sorcerer, and “The Listener” tells of the awful
psychic residuum creeping about an old house where a leper died. In the volume titledIncredible
Adventuresoccur some of the finest tales which the author has yet produced, leading the
fancy to wild rites on nocturnal hills, to secret and terrible aspects lurking behind stolid
scenes, and to unimaginable vaults of mystery below the sands and pyramids of Egypt; all with
a serious finesse and delicacy that convince where a cruder or lighter treatment would merely
amuse. Some of these accounts are hardly stories at all, but rather studies in elusive impressions
and half-remembered snatches of dream. Plot is everywhere negligible, and atmosphere reigns
untrammelled.John Silence—Physician Extraordinaryis a book of five related
tales, through which a single character runs his triumphant course. Marred only by traces of
the popular and conventional detective-story atmosphere—for Dr. Silence is one of those
benevolent geniuses who employ their remarkable powers to aid worthy fellow-men in difficulty—these
narratives contain some of the author’s best work, and produce an illusion at once emphatic
and lasting. The opening tale, “A Psychical Invasion”, relates what befell a sensitive
author in a house once the scene of dark deeds, and how a legion of fiends was exorcised. “Ancient
Sorceries”, perhaps the finest tale in the book, gives an almost hypnotically vivid account
of an old French town where once the unholy Sabbath was kept by all the people in the form of
cats. In “The Nemesis of Fire” a hideous elemental is evoked by new-spilt blood,
whilst “Secret Worship” tells of a German school where Satanism held sway, and where
long afterward an evil aura remained. “The Camp of the Dog” is a werewolf tale,
but is weakened by moralisation and professional “occultism”.Too subtle, perhaps, for definite classification as horror-tales, yet possibly
more truly artistic in an absolute sense, are such delicate phantasies asJimboorThe Centaur.Mr. Blackwood achieves in these novels a close and palpitant approach to the
inmost substance of dream, and works enormous havock with the conventional barriers between
reality and imagination.Unexcelled in the sorcery of crystalline singing prose, and supreme in the
creation of a gorgeous and languorous world of iridescently exotic vision, is Edward John Moreton
Drax Plunkett, Eighteenth Baron Dunsany, whose tales and short plays form an almost unique element
in our literature. Inventor of a new mythology and weaver of surprising folklore, Lord Dunsany
stands dedicated to a strange world of fantastic beauty, and pledged to eternal warfare against
the coarseness and ugliness of diurnal reality. His point of view is the most truly cosmic of
any held in the literature of any period. As sensitive as Poe to dramatic values and the significance
of isolated words and details, and far better equipped rhetorically through a simple lyric style
based on the prose of the King James Bible, this author draws with tremendous effectiveness
on nearly every body of myth and legend within the circle of European culture; producing a composite
or eclectic cycle of phantasy in which Eastern colour, Hellenic form, Teutonic sombreness, and
Celtic wistfulness are so superbly blended that each sustains and supplements the rest without
sacrifice of perfect congruity and homogeneity. In most cases Dunsany’s lands are fabulous—“beyond
the East”, or “at the edge of the world”. His system of original personal
and place names, with roots drawn from classical, Oriental, and other sources, is a marvel of
versatile inventiveness and poetic discrimination; as one may see from such specimens as “Argimēnēs”,
“Bethmoora”, “Poltarnees”, “Camorak”, “Illuriel”,
or “Sardathrion”.Beauty rather than terror is the keynote of Dunsany’s work. He loves
the vivid green of jade and of copper domes, and the delicate flush of sunset on the ivory minarets
of impossible dream-cities. Humour and irony, too, are often present to impart a gentle cynicism
and modify what might otherwise possess a naive intensity. Nevertheless, as is inevitable in
a master of triumphant unreality, there are occasional touches of cosmic fright which come well
within the authentic tradition. Dunsany loves to hint slyly and adroitly of monstrous things
and incredible dooms, as one hints in a fairy tale. InThe Book of Wonderwe read of
Hlo-hlo, the gigantic spider-idol which does not always stay at home; of what the Sphinx feared
in the forest; of Slith, the thief who jumps over the edge of the world after seeing a certain
light lit and knowingwholit it; of the anthropophagous Gibbelins, who inhabit an evil
tower and guard a treasure; of the Gnoles, who live in the forest and from whom it is not well
to steal; of the City of Never, and the eyes that watch in the Under Pits; and of kindred things
of darkness.A Dreamer’s Talestells of the mystery that sent forth all men from
Bethmoora in the desert; of the vast gate of Perdóndaris, that was carved from asingle
pieceof ivory; and of the voyage of poor old Bill, whose captain cursed the crew and paid
calls on nasty-looking isles new-risen from the sea, with low thatched cottages having evil,
obscure windows.Many of Dunsany’s short plays are replete with spectral fear. InThe
Gods of the Mountainseven beggars impersonate the seven green idols on a distant hill,
and enjoy ease and honour in a city of worshippers until they hear thatthe real idols are
missing from their wonted seats.A very ungainly sight in the dusk is reported to them—“rock
should not walk in the evening”—and at last, as they sit awaiting the arrival of
a troop of dancers, they note that the approaching footsteps are heavier than those of good
dancers ought to be. Then things ensue, and in the end the presumptuous blasphemers are turned
to green jade statues by the very walking statues whose sanctity they outraged. But mere plot
is the very least merit of this marvellously effective play. The incidents and developments
are those of a supreme master, so that the whole forms one of the most important contributions
of the present age not only to drama, but to literature in general.A Night at an Inntells of four thieves who have stolen the emerald eye of Klesh, a monstrous Hindoo god. They
lure to their room and succeed in slaying the three priestly avengers who are on their track,
but in the night Klesh comes gropingly for his eye; and having gained it and departed, calls
each of the despoilers out into the darkness for an unnamed punishment. InThe Laughter of
the Godsthere is a doomed city at the jungle’s edge, and a ghostly lutanist heard
only by those about to die (cf. Alice’s spectral harpsichord in Hawthorne’sHouse
of the Seven Gables); whilstThe Queen’s Enemiesretells the anecdote of Herodotus
in which a vengeful princess invites her foes to a subterranean banquet and lets in the Nile
to drown them.But no amount of mere description can convey more than a fraction of Lord Dunsany’s
pervasive charm. His prismatic cities and unheard-of rites are touched with a sureness which
only mastery can engender, and we thrill with a sense of actual participation in his secret
mysteries. To the truly imaginative he is a talisman and a key unlocking rich storehouses of
dream and fragmentary memory; so that we may think of him not only as a poet, but as one who
makes each reader a poet as well.At the opposite pole of genius from Lord Dunsany, and gifted with an almost
diabolic power of calling horror by gentle steps from the midst of prosaic daily life, is the
scholarly Montague Rhodes James, Provost of Eton College, antiquary of note, and recognised
authority on mediaeval manuscripts and cathedral history. Dr. James, long fond of telling spectral
tales at Christmastide, has become by slow degrees a literary weird fictionist of the very first
rank; and has developed a distinctive style and method likely to serve as models for an enduring
line of disciples.The art of Dr. James is by no means haphazard, and in the preface to one of
his collections he has formulated three very sound rules for macabre composition. A ghost story,
he believes, should have a familiar setting in the modern period, in order to approach closely
the reader’s sphere of experience. Its spectral phenomena, moreover, should be malevolent
rather than beneficent; sincefearis the emotion primarily to be excited. And finally,
the technical patois of “occultism” or pseudo-science ought carefully to be avoided;
lest the charm of casual verisimilitude be smothered in unconvincing pedantry.Dr. James, practicing what he preaches, approaches his themes in a light and
often conversational way. Creating the illusion of every-day events, he introduces his abnormal
phenomena cautiously and gradually; relieved at every turn by touches of homely and prosaic
detail, and sometimes spiced with a snatch or two of antiquarian scholarship. Conscious of the
close relation between present weirdness and accumulated tradition, he generally provides remote
historical antecedents for his incidents; thus being able to utilise very aptly his exhaustive
knowledge of the past, and his ready and convincing command of archaic diction and colouring.
A favourite scene for a James tale is some centuried cathedral, which the author can describe
with all the familiar minuteness of a specialist in that field.Sly humorous vignettes and bits of life-like genre portraiture and characterisation
are often to be found in Dr. James’s narratives, and serve in his skilled hands to augment
the general effect rather than to spoil it, as the same qualities would tend to do with a lesser
craftsman. In inventing a new type of ghost, he has departed considerably from the conventional
Gothic tradition; for where the older stock ghosts were pale and stately, and apprehended chiefly
through the sense of sight, the average James ghost is lean, dwarfish, and hairy—a sluggish,
hellish night-abomination midway betwixt beast and man—and usuallytouchedbefore
it isseen.Sometimes the spectre is of still more eccentric composition; a roll of flannel
with spidery eyes, or an invisible entity which moulds itself in bedding and shewsa face
of crumpled linen.Dr. James has, it is clear, an intelligent and scientific knowledge of
human nerves and feelings; and knows just how to apportion statement, imagery, and subtle suggestions
in order to secure the best results with his readers. He is an artist in incident and arrangement
rather than in atmosphere, and reaches the emotions more often through the intellect than directly.
This method, of course, with its occasional absences of sharp climax, has its drawbacks as well
as its advantages; and many will miss the thorough atmospheric tension which writers like Machen
are careful to build up with words and scenes. But only a few of the tales are open to the charge
of tameness. Generally the laconic unfolding of abnormal events in adroit order is amply sufficient
to produce the desired effect of cumulative horror.The short stories of Dr. James are contained in four small collections, entitled
respectivelyGhost-Stories of an Antiquary, More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, A Thin Ghost
and Others,andA Warning to the Curious.There is also a delightful juvenile phantasy,The Five Jars,which has its spectral adumbrations. Amidst this wealth of material it
is hard to select a favourite or especially typical tale, though each reader will no doubt have
such preferences as his temperament may determine.“Count Magnus” is assuredly one of the best, forming as it does
a veritable Golconda of suspense and suggestion. Mr. Wraxall is an English traveller of the
middle nineteenth century, sojourning in Sweden to secure material for a book. Becoming interested
in the ancient family of De la Gardie, near the village of Råbäck, he studies its
records; and finds particular fascination in the builder of the existing manor-house, one Count
Magnus, of whom strange and terrible things are whispered. The Count, who flourished early in
the seventeenth century, was a stern landlord, and famous for his severity toward poachers and
delinquent tenants. His cruel punishments were bywords, and there were dark rumours of influences
which even survived his interment in the great mausoleum he built near the church—as in
the case of the two peasants who hunted on his preserves one night a century after his death.
There were hideous screams in the woods, and near the tomb of Count Magnus an unnatural laugh
and the clang of a great door. Next morning the priest found the two men; one a maniac, and
the other dead, with the flesh of his face sucked from the bones.Mr. Wraxall hears all these tales, and stumbles on more guarded references
to aBlack Pilgrimageonce taken by the Count; a pilgrimage to Chorazin in Palestine,
one of the cities denounced by Our Lord in the Scriptures, and in which old priests say that
Antichrist is to be born. No one dares to hint just what that Black Pilgrimage was, or what
strange being or thing the Count brought back as a companion. Meanwhile Mr. Wraxall is increasingly
anxious to explore the mausoleum of Count Magnus, and finally secures permission to do so, in
the company of a deacon. He finds several monuments and three copper sarcophagi, one of which
is the Count’s. Round the edge of this latter are several bands of engraved scenes, including
a singular and hideous delineation of a pursuit—the pursuit of a frantic man through a
forest by a squat muffled figure with a devil-fish’s tentacle, directed by a tall cloaked
man on a neighbouring hillock. The sarcophagus has three massive steel padlocks, one of which
is lying open on the floor, reminding the traveller of a metallic clash he heard the day before
when passing the mausoleum and wishing idly that he might see Count Magnus.His fascination augmented, and the key being accessible, Mr. Wraxall pays the
mausoleum a second and solitary visit and finds another padlock unfastened. The next day, his
last in Råbäck, he again goes alone to bid the long-dead Count farewell. Once more
queerly impelled to utter a whimsical wish for a meeting with the buried nobleman, he now sees
to his disquiet that only one of the padlocks remains on the great sarcophagus. Even as he looks,
that last lock drops noisily to the floor, and there comes a sound as of creaking hinges. Then
the monstrous lid appears very slowly to rise, and Mr. Wraxall flees in panic fear without refastening
the door of the mausoleum.During his return to England the traveller feels a curious uneasiness about
his fellow-passengers on the canal-boat which he employs for the earlier stages. Cloaked figures
make him nervous, and he has a sense of being watched and followed. Of twenty-eight persons
whom he counts, only twenty-six appear at meals; and the missing two are always a tall cloaked
man and a shorter muffled figure. Completing his water travel at Harwich, Mr. Wraxall takes
frankly to flight in a closed carriage, but sees two cloaked figures at a crossroad. Finally
he lodges at a small house in a village and spends the time making frantic notes. On the second
morning he is found dead, and during the inquest seven jurors faint at sight of the body. The
house where he stayed is never again inhabited, and upon its demolition half a century later
his manuscript is discovered in a forgotten cupboard.In “The Treasure of Abbot Thomas” a British antiquary unriddles
a cipher on some Renaissance painted windows, and thereby discovers a centuried hoard of gold
in a niche half way down a well in the courtyard of a German abbey. But the crafty depositor
had set a guardian over that treasure, and something in the black well twines its arms around
the searcher’s neck in such a manner that the quest is abandoned, and a clergyman sent
for. Each night after that the discoverer feels a stealthy presence and detects a horrible odour
of mould outside the door of his hotel room, till finally the clergyman makes a daylight replacement
of the stone at the mouth of the treasure-vault in the well—out of which something had
come in the dark to avenge the disturbing of old Abbot Thomas’s gold. As he completes
his work the cleric observes a curious toad-like carving on the ancient well-head, with the
Latin motto“Depositum custodi—keep that which is committed to thee.”Other notable James tales are “The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral”,
in which a grotesque carving comes curiously to life to avenge the secret and subtle murder
of an old Dean by his ambitious successor; “‘Oh, Whistle, and I’ll Come to
You, My Lad’”, which tells of the horror summoned by a strange metal whistle found
in a mediaeval church ruin; and “An Episode of Cathedral History”, where the dismantling
of a pulpit uncovers an archaic tomb whose lurking daemon spreads panic and pestilence. Dr.
James, for all his light touch, evokes fright and hideousness in their most shocking forms;
and will certainly stand as one of the few really creative masters in his darksome province.For those who relish speculation regarding the future, the tale of supernatural
horror provides an interesting field. Combated by a mounting wave of plodding realism, cynical
flippancy, and sophisticated disillusionment, it is yet encouraged by a parallel tide of growing
mysticism, as developed both through the fatigued reaction of “occultists” and religious
fundamentalists against materialistic discovery and through the stimulation of wonder and fancy
by such enlarged vistas and broken barriers as modern science has given us with its intra-atomic
chemistry, advancing astrophysics, doctrines of relativity, and probings into biology and human
thought. At the present moment the favouring forces would appear to have somewhat of an advantage;
since there is unquestionably more cordiality shewn toward weird writings than when, thirty
years ago, the best of Arthur Machen’s work fell on the stony ground of the smart and
cocksure ’nineties. Ambrose Bierce, almost unknown in his own time, has now reached something
like general recognition.Startling mutations, however, are not to be looked for in either direction.
In any case an approximate balance of tendencies will continue to exist; and while we may justly
expect a further subtilisation of technique, we have no reason to think that the general position
of the spectral in literature will be altered. It is a narrow though essential branch of human
expression, and will chiefly appeal as always to a limited audience with keen special sensibilities.
Whatever universal masterpiece of tomorrow may be wrought from phantasm or terror will owe its
acceptance rather to a supreme workmanship than to a sympathetic theme. Yet who shall declare
the dark theme a positive handicap? Radiant with beauty, the Cup of the Ptolemies was carven
of onyx."
