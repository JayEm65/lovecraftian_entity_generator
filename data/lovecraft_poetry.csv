An American to Mother EnglandBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"England! My England! Can the surging seaThat lies between us tear my heart from thee?Can distant birth and distant dwelling drainTh’ ancestral blood that warms the loyal vein?Isle of my Fathers! hear the filial songOf him whose sources but to thee belong!World-conquering Mother! by thy mighty handWas carv’d from savage wilds my native land:Thy matchless sons the firm foundation laid;Thy matchless arts the nascent nation made:By thy just laws the young republic grew,And thro’ thy greatness, kindred greatness knew:What man that springs from thy untainted lineBut sees Columbia’s virtues all as thine?Whilst nameless multitudes upon our shoreFrom the dim corners of creation pour,Whilst mongrel slaves crawl hither to partakeOf Saxon liberty they could not make,From such an alien crew in grief I turn,And for the mother’s voice of Britain burn.England! Can aught remove the cherish’d chainThat binds my spirit to thy blest domain?Can Revolution’s bitter precepts swayThe soul that must the ties of race obey?Create a new Columbia if ye will;The flesh that forms me is Britannic still!Hail! oaken shades, and meads of dewy green,So oft in sleep, yet ne’er in waking seen.Peal out, ye ancient chimes, from vine-clad tow’rWhere pray’d my fathers in a vanish’d hour:What countless years of rev’rence can ye claimFrom bygone worshippers that bore my name!Their forms are crumbling in the vaults around,Whilst I, across the sea, but dream the sound.Return, Sweet Vision! Let me glimpse againThe stone-built abbey, rising o’er the plain;The neighb’ring village with its sun-show’r’d square;The shaded mill-stream, and the forest fair,The hedge-lin’d lane, that leads to rustic cotWhere sweet contentment is the peasant’s lot;The mystic grove, by Druid wraiths possess’d,The flow’ring fields, with fairy-castles blest:And the old manor-house, sedate and dark,Set in the shadows of the wooded park.Can this be dreaming? Must my eyelids closeThat I may catch the fragrance of the rose?Is it in fancy that the midnight valeThrills with the warblings of the nightingale?A golden moon bewitching radiance yields,And England’s fairies trip o’er England’s fields.England! Old England! in my love for theeNo dream is mine, but blessed memory;Such haunting images and hidden firesCourse with the bounding blood of British sires:From British bodies, minds, and souls I come,And from them draw the vision of their home.Awake, Columbia! scorn the vulgar ageThat bids thee slight thy lordly heritage.Let not the wide Atlantic’s wildest waveBurst the blest bonds that fav’ring Nature gave:Connecting surges ’twixt the nations run,Our Saxon souls dissolving into one!"
The Ancient TrackBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"There was no hand to hold me backThat night I found the ancient trackOver the hill, and strained to seeThe fields that teased my memory.This tree, that wall—I knew them well,And all the roofs and orchards fellFamiliarly upon my mindAs from a past not far behind.I knew what shadows would be castWhen the late moon came up at lastFrom back of Zaman’s Hill, and howThe vale would shine three hours from now.And when the path grew steep and high,And seemed to end against the sky,I had no fear of what might restBeyond that silhouetted crest.Straight on I walked, while all the nightGrew pale with phosphorescent light,And wall and farmhouse gable glowedUnearthly by the climbing road.There was the milestone that I knew—“Two miles to Dunwich”—now the viewOf distant spire and roofs would dawnWith ten more upward paces gone. . . .There was no hand to hold me backThat night I found the ancient track,And reached the crest to see outspreadA valley of the lost and dead:And over Zaman’s Hill the hornOf a malignant moon was born,To light the weeds and vines that grewOn ruined walls I never knew.The fox-fire glowed in field and bog,And unknown waters spewed a fogWhose curling talons mocked the thoughtThat I had ever known this spot.Too well I saw from the mad sceneThat my loved past had never been—Nor was I now upon the trailDescending to that long-dead vale.Around was fog—ahead, the sprayOf star-streams in the Milky Way. . . .There was no hand to hold me backThat night I found the ancient track."
ArcadiaBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"By Head BalledupO give me the life of the village,Uninhibited, free, and sweet;The place where the arts all flourish,Grove Court and Christopher Street.I am sick of the old conventions,And critics who will not praise,So sing ho for the open spaces,And aesthetes with kindly ways.Here every bard is a genius,And artists are Raphaels,And above the roofs of Patchin PlaceThe Muse of Talent dwells."
AstrophobosBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"In the midnight heavens burningThro’ ethereal deeps afar,Once I watch’d with restless yearningAn alluring, aureate star;Ev’ry eye aloft returning,Gleaming nigh the Arctic car.Mystic waves of beauty blendedWith the gorgeous golden rays;Phantasies of bliss descendedIn a myrrh’d Elysian haze;And in lyre-born chords extendedHarmonies of Lydian lays.There (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,Where the free and blessed dwell,And each moment bears a treasureFreighted with a lotus-spell,And there floats a liquid measureFrom the lute of Israfel.There (I told myself) were shiningWorlds of happiness unknown,Peace and Innocence entwiningBy the Crowned Virtue’s throne;Men of light, their thoughts refiningPurer, fairer, than our own.Thus I mus’d, when o’er the visionCrept a red delirious change;Hope dissolving to derision,Beauty to distortion strange;Hymnic chords in weird collision,Spectral sights in endless range.Crimson burn’d the star of sadnessAs behind the beams I peer’d;All was woe that seem’d but gladnessEre my gaze with truth was sear’d;Cacodaemons, mir’d with madness,Thro’ the fever’d flick’ring leer’d.Now I know the fiendish fableThat the golden glitter bore;Now I shun the spangled sableThat I watch’d and lov’d before;But the horror, set and stable,Haunts my soul for evermore."
The CatsBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Babels of blocks to the high heavens tow’ring,Flames of futility swirling below;Poisonous fungi in brick and stone flow’ring,Lanterns that shudder and death-lights that glow.Black monstrous bridges across oily rivers,Cobwebs of cable by nameless things spun;Catacomb deeps whose dank chaos deliversStreams of live foetor, that rots in the sun.Colour and splendour, disease and decaying,Shrieking and ringing and scrambling insane,Rabbles exotic to stranger-gods praying,Jumbles of odour that stifle the brain.Legions of cats from the alleys nocturnal,Howling and lean in the glare of the moon,Screaming the future with mouthings infernal,Yelling the burden of Pluto’s red rune.Tall tow’rs and pyramids ivy’d and crumbling,Bats that swoop low in the weed-cumber’d streets;Bleak broken bridges o’er rivers whose rumblingJoins with no voice as the thick tide retreats.Belfries that blackly against the moon totter,Caverns whose mouths are by mosses effac’d,And living to answer the wind and the water,Only the lean cats that howl in the waste!"
ChristmasBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"The cottage hearth beams warm and bright,The candles gaily glow;The stars emit a kinder lightAbove the drifted snow.Down from the sky a magic stealsTo glad the passing year,And belfries sing with joyous peals,For Christmastide is here!"
[Christmas Greetingsto Annie E. P. Gamwell]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"As when a pigeon, loos’d in realms remote,Takes instant wing, and seeks his native cote,So speed my blessings from a barb’rous climeTo thee and Providence at Christmas time!"
[Christmas Greetingsto Eugene B. Kuntz et al.]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"May good St. Nick, like as a bird of night,Bring thee rich blessings in his annual flight;Long by thy chimney rest his pond’rous pack,And leave with lessen’d weight upon his back!"
[Christmas Greetings to Felis(Frank Belknap Long’s cat)]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Little Tiger, burning brightWith a subtle Blakeish light,Tell what visions have their homeIn those eyes of flame and chrome!Children vex thee—thoughtless, gay—Holding when thou wouldst away:What dark lore is that which thou,Spitting, mixest with thy meow?"
[Christmas Greetings to Felis(Frank Belknap Long’s cat)]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Haughty Sphinx, whose amber eyesHold the secrets of the skies,As thou ripplest in thy grace,Round the chairs and chimney-place,Scorn on thy patrician face:Hiss not harsh, nor use thy clawsOn the hand that gives applause—Good-will only doth abideIn these lines at Christmastide!"
[Christmas Greetings to Laurie A. Sawyer]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"As Christmas snows (as yet a poet’s trope)Call back one’s bygone days of youth and hope,Four metrick lines I send—they’re quite enough—Tho’ once I fancy’d I could write the stuff!"
[Christmas Greetings to Rheinhart Kleiner]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"St. John, whose art sublimely shinesIn liquid odes and melting lines,Let Theobald his regard expressIn verse of lesser loveliness.As now in regal state appearThe festive hours of Yuletide cheer,My strongest wish is that you mayFeel ev’ry blessing of the day!"
[Christmas Greetings to Sonia H. Greene]By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Once more the ancient feast returns,And the bright hearth domestic burnsWith Yuletide’s added blaze;So, too, may all your joys increaseMidst floods of mem’ry, love, and peace,And dreams of Halcyon days."
The CityBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"It was golden and splendid,That City of light;A vision suspendedIn deeps of the night;A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.I remember the seasonIt dawn’d on my gaze;The mad time of unreason,The brain-numbing daysWhen Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze.More lovely than ZionIt shone in the sky,When the beams of OrionBeclouded my eye,Bringing sleep that was fill’d with dim mem’ries of moments obscure and gone by.Its mansions were statelyWith carvings made fair,Each rising sedatelyOn terraces rare,And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming there.The avenues lur’d meWith vistas sublime;Tall arches assur’d meThat once on a timeI had wander’d in rapture beneath them, and bask’d in the Halcyon clime.On the plazas were standingA sculptur’d array;Long-bearded, commanding,Grave men in their day—But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face batter’d away.In that city effulgentNo mortal I saw;But my fancy, indulgentTo memory’s law,Linger’d long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with awe.I fann’d the faint emberThat glow’d in my mind,And strove to rememberThe aeons behind;To rove thro’ infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin’d.Then the horrible warningUpon my soul spedLike the ominous morningThat rises in red,And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead."
The ConscriptBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"I am a peaceful working man—I am not wise or strong—But I can follow Nature’s planIn labour, rest, and song.One day the men that rule us allDecided we must die,Else pride and freedom surely fallIn the dim bye and bye.They told me I must write my nameUpon a scroll of death;That some day I should rise to fameBy giving up my breath.I do not know what I have doneThat I should thus be boundTo wait for tortures one by one,And then an unmark’d mound.I hate no man, and yet they sayThat I must fight and kill;That I must suffer day by dayTo please a master’s will.I used to have a conscience free,But now they bid it rest;They’ve made a number out of me,And I must ne’er protest.They tell of trenches, long and deep,Fill’d with the mangled slain;They talk till I can scarcely sleep,So reeling is my brain.They tell of filth, and blood, and woe;Of things beyond belief;Of things that make me tremble soWith mingled fright and grief.I do not know what I shall do—Is not the law unjust?I can’t do what they want me to,And yet they say I must!Each day my doom doth nearer bring;Each day the State prepares;Sometimes I feel a watching thingThat stares, and stares, and stares.I never seem to sleep—my headWhirls in the queerest way.Why am I chosen to be deadUpon some fateful day?Yet hark—some fibre is o’erwrought—A giddying wine I quaff—Things seem so odd, I can do naughtBut laugh, and laugh, and laugh!"
Dead Passion’s FlameBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"A Poem by Blank FrailtyAh, Passion, like a voice—that buds!With many thorns . . . that sharply stick:Recalls to me the longing of our bloods . . .And—makes my wearied heart requick! . . . . . . . ."
DespairBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"O’er the midnight moorlands crying,Thro’ the cypress forests sighing,In the night-wind madly flying,Hellish forms with streaming hair;In the barren branches creaking,By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking;Damn’d daemons of despair.Once, I think I half remember,Ere the grey skies of NovemberQuench’d my youth’s aspiring ember,Liv’d there such a thing as bliss;Skies that now are dark were beaming,Gold and azure, splendid seemingTill I learn’d it all was dreaming—Deadly drowsiness of Dis.But the stream of Time, swift flowing,Brings the torment of half-knowing—Dimly rushing, blindly goingPast the never-trodden lea;And the voyager, repining,Sees the wicked death-fires shining,Hears the wicked petrel’s whiningAs he helpless drifts to sea.Evil wings in ether beating;Vultures at the spirit eating;Things unseen forever fleetingBlack against the leering sky.Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,Clawing fiends of future sadness,Mingle in a cloud of madnessEver on the soul to lie.Thus the living, lone and sobbing,In the throes of anguish throbbing,With the loathsome Furies robbingNight and noon of peace and rest.But beyond the groans and gratingOf abhorrent Life, is waitingSweet Oblivion, culminatingAll the years of fruitless quest."
Fact and FancyBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"How dull the wretch, whose philosophic mindDisdains the pleasures of fantastic kind;Whose prosy thoughts the joys of life exclude,And wreck the solace of the poet’s mood!Young Zeno, practic’d in the Stoic’s art,Rejects the language of the glowing heart;Dissolves sweet Nature to a mess of laws;Condemns th’ effect whilst looking for the cause;Freezes poor Ovid in an ic’d review,And sneers because his fables are untrue!In search of Truth the hopeful zealot goes,But all the sadder tums, the more he knows!Stay! vandal sophist, whose deep lore would blastThe graceful legends of the story’d past;Whose tongue in censure flays th’ embellish’d page,And scolds the comforts of a dreary age:Would’st strip the foliage from the vital boughTill all men grow as wisely dull as thou?Happy the man whose fresh, untainted eyeDiscerns a Pantheon in the spangled sky;Finds Sylphs and Dryads in the waving trees,And spies soft Notus in the southern breeze;For whom the stream a cheering carol sings,While reedy music by the fountain rings;To whom the waves a Nereid tale confideTill friendly presence fills the rising tide.Happy is he, who void of learning’s woes,Th’ ethereal life of body’d Nature knows:I scorn the sage that tells me it but seems,And flout his gravity in sunlit dreams!"
FestivalBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"There is snow on the ground,And the valleys are cold,And a midnight profoundBlackly squats o’er the wold;But a light on the hilltops half-seen hints of feastings unhallow’d and old.There is death in the clouds,There is fear in the night,For the dead in their shroudsHail the sun’s turning flight,And chant wild in the woods as they dance round a Yule-altar fungous and white.To no gale of earth’s kindSways the forest of oak,Where the sick boughs entwin’dBy mad mistletoes choke,For these pow’rs are the pow’rs of the dark, from the graves of the lost Druid-folk.And mayst thou to such deedsBe an abbot and priest,Singing cannibal greedsAt each devil-wrought feast,And to all the incredulous world shewing dimly the sign of the beast."
Fungi from YuggothBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"I. The BookThe place was dark and dusty and half-lostIn tangles of old alleys near the quays,Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas,And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed.Small lozenge panes, obscured by smoke and frost,Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees,Rotting from floor to roof—congeriesOf crumbling elder lore at little cost.I entered, charmed, and from a cobwebbed heapTook up the nearest tome and thumbed it through,Trembling at curious words that seemed to keepSome secret, monstrous if one only knew.Then, looking for some seller old in craft,I could find nothing but a voice that laughed.II. PursuitI held the book beneath my coat, at painsTo hide the thing from sight in such a place;Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanesWith often-turning head and nervous pace.Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brickPeered at me oddly as I hastened by,And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sickFor a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky.No one had seen me take the thing—but stillA blank laugh echoed in my whirling head,And I could guess what nighted worlds of illLurked in that volume I had coveted.The way grew strange—the walls alike and madding—And far behind me, unseen feet were padding.III. The KeyI do not know what windings in the wasteOf those strange sea-lanes brought me home once more,But on my porch I trembled, white with hasteTo get inside and bolt the heavy door.I had the book that told the hidden wayAcross the void and through the space-hung screensThat hold the undimensioned worlds at bay,And keep lost aeons to their own demesnes.At last the key was mine to those vague visionsOf sunset spires and twilight woods that broodDim in the gulfs beyond this earth’s precisions,Lurking as memories of infinitude.The key was mine, but as I sat there mumbling,The attic window shook with a faint fumbling.IV. RecognitionThe day had come again, when as a childI saw—just once—that hollow of old oaks,Grey with a ground-mist that enfolds and chokesThe slinking shapes which madness has defiled.It was the same—an herbage rank and wildClings round an altar whose carved sign invokesThat Nameless One to whom a thousand smokesRose, aeons gone, from unclean towers up-piled.I saw the body spread on that dank stone,And knew those things which feasted were not men;I knew this strange, grey world was not my own,But Yuggoth, past the starry voids—and thenThe body shrieked at me with a dead cry,And all too late I knew that it was I!V. HomecomingThe daemon said that he would take me homeTo the pale, shadowy land I half recalledAs a high place of stair and terrace, walledWith marble balustrades that sky-winds comb,While miles below a maze of dome on domeAnd tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled.Once more, he told me, I would stand enthralledOn those old heights, and hear the far-off foam.All this he promised, and through sunset’s gateHe swept me, past the lapping lakes of flame,And red-gold thrones of gods without a nameWho shriek in fear at some impending fate.Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night:“Here was your home,” he mocked, “when you had sight!”VI. The LampWe found the lamp inside those hollow cliffsWhose chiseled sign no priest in Thebes could read,And from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphsWarned every living creature of earth’s breed.No more was there—just that one brazen bowlWith traces of a curious oil within;Fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll,And symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin.Little the fears of forty centuries meantTo us as we bore off our slender spoil,And when we scanned it in our darkened tentWe struck a match to test the ancient oil.It blazed—great God! . . . But the vast shapes we sawIn that mad flash have seared our lives with awe.VII. Zaman’s HillThe great hill hung close over the old town,A precipice against the main street’s end;Green, tall, and wooded, looking darkly downUpon the steeple at the highway bend.Two hundred years the whispers had been heardAbout what happened on the man-shunned slope—Tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird,Or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope.One day the mail-man found no village there,Nor were its folk or houses seen again;People came out from Aylesbury to stare—Yet they all told the mail-man it was plainThat he was mad for saying he had spiedThe great hill’s gluttonous eyes, and jaws stretched wide.VIII. The PortTen miles from Arkham I had struck the trailThat rides the cliff-edge over Boynton Beach,And hoped that just at sunset I could reachThe crest that looks on Innsmouth in the vale.Far out at sea was a retreating sail,White as hard years of ancient winds could bleach,But evil with some portent beyond speech,So that I did not wave my hand or hail.Sails out of Innsmouth! echoing old renownOf long-dead times. But now a too-swift nightIs closing in, and I have reached the heightWhence I so often scan the distant town.The spires and roofs are there—but look! The gloomSinks on dark lanes, as lightless as the tomb!IX. The CourtyardIt was the city I had known before;The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngsChant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongsIn crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore.The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at meFrom where they leaned, drunk and half-animate,As edging through the filth I passed the gateTo the black courtyard where the man would be.The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursedThat ever I had come to such a den,When suddenly a score of windows burstInto wild light, and swarmed with dancing men:Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead—And not a corpse had either hands or head!X. The Pigeon-FlyersThey took me slumming, where gaunt walls of brickBulge outward with a viscous stored-up evil,And twisted faces, thronging foul and thick,Wink messages to alien god and devil.A million fires were blazing in the streets,And from flat roofs a furtive few would flyBedraggled birds into the yawning skyWhile hidden drums droned on with measured beats.I knew those fires were brewing monstrous things,And that those birds of space had beenOutside—I guessed to what dark planet’s crypts they plied,And what they brought from Thog beneath their wings.The others laughed—till struck too mute to speakBy what they glimpsed in one bird’s evil beak.XI. The WellFarmer Seth Atwood was past eighty whenHe tried to sink that deep well by his door,With only Eb to help him bore and bore.We laughed, and hoped he’d soon be sane again.And yet, instead, young Eb went crazy, too,So that they shipped him to the county farm.Seth bricked the well-mouth up as tight as glue—Then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm.After the funeral we felt bound to getOut to that well and rip the bricks away,But all we saw were iron hand-holds setDown a black hole deeper than we could say.And yet we put the bricks back—for we foundThe hole too deep for any line to sound.XII. The HowlerThey told me not to take the Briggs’ Hill pathThat used to be the highroad through to Zoar,For Goody Watkins, hanged in seventeen-four,Had left a certain monstrous aftermath.Yet when I disobeyed, and had in viewThe vine-hung cottage by the great rock slope,I could not think of elms or hempen rope,But wondered why the house still seemed so new.Stopping a while to watch the fading day,I heard faint howls, as from a room upstairs,When through the ivied panes one sunset rayStruck in, and caught the howler unawares.I glimpsed—and ran in frenzy from the place,And from a four-pawed thing with human face.XIII. HesperiaThe winter sunset, flaming beyond spiresAnd chimneys half-detached from this dull sphere,Opens great gates to some forgotten yearOf elder splendours and divine desires.Expectant wonders burn in those rich fires,Adventure-fraught, and not untinged with fear;A row of sphinxes where the way leads clearToward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres.It is the land where beauty’s meaning flowers;Where every unplaced memory has a source;Where the great river Time begins its courseDown the vast void in starlit streams of hours.Dreams bring us close—but ancient lore repeatsThat human tread has never soiled these streets.XIV. Star-WindsIt is a certain hour of twilight glooms,Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind poursDown hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors,But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms.The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic twists,And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,Heeding geometries of outer space,While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists.This is the hour when moonstruck poets knowWhat fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scentsAnd tints of flowers fill Nithon’s continents,Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,A dozen more of ours they sweep away!XV. AntarktosDeep in my dream the great bird whispered queerlyOf the black cone amid the polar waste;Pushing above the ice-sheet lone and drearly,By storm-crazed aeons battered and defaced.Hither no living earth-shapes take their courses,And only pale auroras and faint sunsGlow on that pitted rock, whose primal sourcesAre guessed at dimly by the Elder Ones.If men should glimpse it, they would merely wonderWhat tricky mound of Nature’s build they spied;But the bird told of vaster parts, that underThe mile-deep ice-shroud crouch and brood and bide.God help the dreamer whose mad visions shewThose dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below!XVI. The WindowThe house was old, with tangled wings outthrown,Of which no one could ever half keep track,And in a small room somewhat near the backWas an odd window sealed with ancient stone.There, in a dream-plagued childhood, quite aloneI used to go, where night reigned vague and black;Parting the cobwebs with a curious lackOf fear, and with a wonder each time grown.One later day I brought the masons thereTo find what view my dim forbears had shunned,But as they pierced the stone, a rush of airBurst from the alien voids that yawned beyond.They fled—but I peered through and found unrolledAll the wild worlds of which my dreams had told.XVII. A MemoryThere were great steppes, and rocky table-landsStretching half-limitless in starlit night,With alien campfires shedding feeble lightOn beasts with tinkling bells, in shaggy bands.Far to the south the plain sloped low and wideTo a dark zigzag line of wall that layLike a huge python of some primal dayWhich endless time had chilled and petrified.I shivered oddly in the cold, thin air,And wondered where I was and how I came,When a cloaked form against a campfire’s glareRose and approached, and called me by my name.Staring at that dead face beneath the hood,I ceased to hope—because I understood.XVIII. The Gardens of YinBeyond that wall, whose ancient masonryReached almost to the sky in moss-thick towers,There would be terraced gardens, rich with flowers,And flutter of bird and butterfly and bee.There would be walks, and bridges arching overWarm lotos-pools reflecting temple eaves,And cherry-trees with delicate boughs and leavesAgainst a pink sky where the herons hover.All would be there, for had not old dreams flungOpen the gate to that stone-lanterned mazeWhere drowsy streams spin out their winding ways,Trailed by green vines from bending branches hung?I hurried—but when the wall rose, grim and great,I found there was no longer any gate.XIX. The BellsYear after year I heard that faint, far ringingOf deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind;Peals from no steeple I could ever find,But strange, as if across some great void winging.I searched my dreams and memories for a clue,And thought of all the chimes my visions carried;Of quiet Innsmouth, where the white gulls tarriedAround an ancient spire that once I knew.Always perplexed I heard those far notes falling,Till one March night the bleak rain splashing coldBeckoned me back through gateways of recallingTo elder towers where the mad clappers tolled.They tolled—but from the sunless tides that pourThrough sunken valleys on the sea’s dead floor.XX. Night-GauntsOut of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,But every night I see the rubbery things,Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings,And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell.They come in legions on the north wind’s swell,With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,Snatching me off on monstrous voyagingsTo grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare’s well.Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep,Heedless of all the cries I try to make,And down the nether pits to that foul lakeWhere the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.But oh! If only they would make some sound,Or wear a face where faces should be found!XXI. NyarlathotepAnd at the last from inner Egypt cameThe strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed;Silent and lean and cryptically proud,And wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame.Throngs pressed around, frantic for his commands,But leaving, could not tell what they had heard;While through the nations spread the awestruck wordThat wild beasts followed him and licked his hands.Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolledDown on the quaking citadels of man.Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,The idiot Chaos blew Earth’s dust away.XXII. AzathothOut in the mindless void the daemon bore me,Past the bright clusters of dimensioned space,Till neither time nor matter stretched before me,But only Chaos, without form or place.Here the vast Lord of All in darkness mutteredThings he had dreamed but could not understand,While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and flutteredIn idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned.They danced insanely to the high, thin whiningOf a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw,Whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combiningGives each frail cosmos its eternal law.“I am His Messenger,” the daemon said,As in contempt he struck his Master’s head.XXIII. MirageI do not know if ever it existed—That lost world floating dimly on Time’s stream—And yet I see it often, violet-misted,And shimmering at the back of some vague dream.There were strange towers and curious lapping rivers,Labyrinths of wonder, and low vaults of light,And bough-crossed skies of flame, like that which quiversWistfully just before a winter’s night.Great moors led off to sedgy shores unpeopled,Where vast birds wheeled, while on a windswept hillThere was a village, ancient and white-steepled,With evening chimes for which I listen still.I do not know what land it is—or dareAsk when or why I was, or will be, there.XXIV. The CanalSomewhere in dream there is an evil placeWhere tall, deserted buildings crowd alongA deep, black, narrow channel, reeking strongOf frightful things whence oily currents race.Lanes with old walls half meeting overheadWind off to streets one may or may not know,And feeble moonlight sheds a spectral glowOver long rows of windows, dark and dead.There are no footfalls, and the one soft soundIs of the oily water as it glidesUnder stone bridges, and along the sidesOf its deep flume, to some vague ocean bound.None lives to tell when that stream washed awayIts dream-lost region from the world of clay.XXV. St. Toad’s“Beware St. Toad’s cracked chimes!” I heard him screamAs I plunged into those mad lanes that windIn labyrinths obscure and undefinedSouth of the river where old centuries dream.He was a furtive figure, bent and ragged,And in a flash had staggered out of sight,So still I burrowed onward in the nightToward where more roof-lines rose, malign and jagged.No guide-book told of what was lurking here—But now I heard another old man shriek:“Beware St. Toad’s cracked chimes!” And growing weak,I paused, when a third greybeard croaked in fear:“Beware St. Toad’s cracked chimes!” Aghast, I fled—Till suddenly that black spire loomed ahead.XXVI. The FamiliarsJohn Whateley lived about a mile from town,Up where the hills began to huddle thick;We never thought his wits were very quick,Seeing the way he let his farm run down.He used to waste his time on some queer booksHe’d found around the attic of his place,Till funny lines got creased into his face,And folks all said they didn’t like his looks.When he began those night-howls we declaredHe’d better be locked up away from harm,So three men from the Aylesbury town farmWent for him—but came back alone and scared.They’d found him talking to two crouching thingsThat at their step flew off on great black wings.XXVII. The Elder PharosFrom Leng, where rocky peaks climb bleak and bareUnder cold stars obscure to human sight,There shoots at dusk a single beam of lightWhose far blue rays make shepherds whine in prayer.They say (though none has been there) that it comesOut of a pharos in a tower of stone,Where the last Elder One lives on alone,Talking to Chaos with the beat of drums.The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken maskOf yellow, whose queer folds appear to hideA face not of this earth, though none dares askJust what those features are, which bulge inside.Many, in man’s first youth, sought out that glow,But what they found, no one will ever know.XXVIII. ExpectancyI cannot tell why some things hold for meA sense of unplumbed marvels to befall,Or of a rift in the horizon’s wallOpening to worlds where only gods can be.There is a breathless, vague expectancy,As of vast ancient pomps I half recall,Or wild adventures, uncorporeal,Ecstasy-fraught, and as a day-dream free.It is in sunsets and strange city spires,Old villages and woods and misty downs,South winds, the sea, low hills, and lighted towns,Old gardens, half-heard songs, and the moon’s fires.But though its lure alone makes life worth living,None gains or guesses what it hints at giving.XXIX. NostalgiaOnce every year, in autumn’s wistful glow,The birds fly out over an ocean waste,Calling and chattering in a joyous hasteTo reach some land their inner memories know.Great terraced gardens where bright blossoms blow,And lines of mangoes luscious to the taste,And temple-groves with branches interlacedOver cool paths—all these their vague dreams shew.They search the sea for marks of their old shore—For the tall city, white and turreted—But only empty waters stretch ahead,So that at last they turn away once more.Yet sunken deep where alien polyps throng,The old towers miss their lost, remembered song.XXX. BackgroundI never can be tied to raw, new things,For I first saw the light in an old town,Where from my window huddled roofs sloped downTo a quaint harbour rich with visionings.Streets with carved doorways where the sunset beamsFlooded old fanlights and small window-panes,And Georgian steeples topped with gilded vanes—These were the sights that shaped my childhood dreams.Such treasures, left from times of cautious leaven,Cannot but loose the hold of flimsier wraithsThat flit with shifting ways and muddled faithsAcross the changeless walls of earth and heaven.They cut the moment’s thongs and leave me freeTo stand alone before eternity.XXXI. The DwellerIt had been old when Babylon was new;None knows how long it slept beneath that mound,Where in the end our questing shovels foundIts granite blocks and brought it back to view.There were vast pavements and foundation-walls,And crumbling slabs and statues, carved to shewFantastic beings of some long agoPast anything the world of man recalls.And then we saw those stone steps leading downThrough a choked gate of graven dolomiteTo some black haven of eternal nightWhere elder signs and primal secrets frown.We cleared a path—but raced in mad retreatWhen from below we heard those clumping feet.XXXII. AlienationHis solid flesh had never been away,For each dawn found him in his usual place,But every night his spirit loved to raceThrough gulfs and worlds remote from common day.He had seen Yaddith, yet retained his mind,And come back safely from the Ghooric zone,When one still night across curved space was thrownThat beckoning piping from the voids behind.He waked that morning as an older man,And nothing since has looked the same to him.Objects around float nebulous and dim—False, phantom trifles of some vaster plan.His folk and friends are now an alien throngTo which he struggles vainly to belong.XXXIII. Harbour WhistlesOver old roofs and past decaying spiresThe harbour whistles chant all through the night;Throats from strange ports, and beaches far and white,And fabulous oceans, ranged in motley choirs.Each to the other alien and unknown,Yet all, by some obscurely focussed forceFrom brooding gulfs beyond the Zodiac’s course,Fused into one mysterious cosmic drone.Through shadowy dreams they send a marching lineOf still more shadowy shapes and hints and views;Echoes from outer voids, and subtle cluesTo things which they themselves cannot define.And always in that chorus, faintly blent,We catch some notes no earth-ship ever sent.XXXIV. RecaptureThe way led down a dark, half-wooded heathWhere moss-grey boulders humped above the mould,And curious drops, disquieting and cold,Sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath.There was no wind, nor any trace of soundIn puzzling shrub, or alien-featured tree,Nor any view before—till suddenly,Straight in my path, I saw a monstrous mound.Half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread,Rank-grassed, and cluttered by a crumbling flightOf lava stairs that scaled the fear-topped heightIn steps too vast for any human tread.I shrieked—andknewwhat primal star and yearHad sucked me back from man’s dream-transient sphere!XXXV. Evening StarI saw it from that hidden, silent placeWhere the old wood half shuts the meadow in.It shone through all the sunset’s glories—thinAt first, but with a slowly brightening face.Night came, and that lone beacon, amber-hued,Beat on my sight as never it did of old;The evening star—but grown a thousandfoldMore haunting in this hush and solitude.It traced strange pictures on the quivering air—Half-memories that had always filled my eyes—Vast towers and gardens; curious seas and skiesOf some dim life—I never could tell where.But now I knew that through the cosmic domeThose rays were calling from my far, lost home.XXXVI. ContinuityThere is in certain ancient things a traceOf some dim essence—more than form or weight;A tenuous aether, indeterminate,Yet linked with all the laws of time and space.A faint, veiled sign of continuitiesThat outward eyes can never quite descry;Of locked dimensions harbouring years gone by,And out of reach except for hidden keys.It moves me most when slanting sunbeams glowOn old farm buildings set against a hill,And paint with life the shapes which linger stillFrom centuries less a dream than this we know.In that strange light I feel I am not farFrom the fixt mass whose sides the ages are."
A GardenBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"There’s an ancient, ancient garden that I see sometimes in dreams,Where the very Maytime sunlight plays and glows with spectral gleams;Where the gaudy-tinted blossoms seem to wither into grey,And the crumbling walls and pillars waken thoughts of yesterday.There are vines in nooks and crannies, and there’s moss about the pool,And the tangled weedy thicket chokes the arbour dark and cool:In the silent sunken pathways springs an herbage sparse and spare,Where the musty scent of dead things dulls the fragrance of the air.There is not a living creature in the lonely space around,And the hedge-encompass’d quiet never echoes to a sound.As I walk, and wait, and listen, I will often seek to findWhen it was I knew that garden in an age long left behind;I will oft conjure a vision of a day that is no more,As I gaze upon the grey, grey scenes I feel I knew before.Then a sadness settles o’er me, and a tremor seems to start:For I know the flow’rs are shrivell’d hopes—the garden is my heart!"
Hallowe’en in a SuburbBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"The steeples are white in the wild moonlight,And the trees have a silver glare;Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,And the harpies of upper air,That flutter and laugh and stare.For the village dead to the moon outspreadNever shone in the sunset’s gleam,But grew out of the deep that the dead years keepWhere the rivers of madness streamDown the gulfs to a pit of dream.A chill wind weaves thro’ the rows of sheavesIn the meadows that shimmer pale,And comes to twine where the headstones shineAnd the ghouls of the churchyard wailFor harvests that fly and fail.Not a breath of the strange grey gods of changeThat tore from the past its ownCan quicken this hour, when a spectral pow’rSpreads sleep o’er the cosmic throneAnd looses the vast unknown.So here again stretch the vale and plainThat moons long-forgotten saw,And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,Sprung out of the tomb’s black mawTo shake all the world with awe.And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,The ugliness and the pestOf rows where thick rise the stones and brick,Shall some day be with the rest,And brood with the shades unblest.Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,And the leprous spires ascend;For new and old alike in the foldOf horror and death are penn’d,For the hounds of Time to rend."
The HouseBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"’Tis a grove-circled dwellingSet close to a hill,Where the branches are tellingStrange legends of ill;Over timbers so oldThat they breathe of the dead,Crawl the vines, green and cold,By strange nourishment fed;And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank slimy bed.In the gardens are growingTall blossoms and fair,Each pallid bloom throwingPerfume on the air;But the afternoon sunWith its shining red raysMakes the picture loom dunOn the curious gaze,And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless days.The rank grasses are wavingOn terrace and lawn,Dim memories sav’ringOf things that have gone;The stones of the walksAre encrusted and wet,And a strange spirit stalksWhen the red sun has set,And the soul of the watcher is fill’d with faint pictures he fain would forget.It was in the hot JunetimeI stood by that scene,When the gold rays of noontimeBeat bright on the green.But I shiver’d with cold,Groping feebly for light,As a picture unroll’d—And my age-spanning sightSaw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the night."
In a Sequester’d Providence ChurchyardWhere Once Poe Walk’dBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,Arch’d high above a hidden world of yore.Round all the scene a light of memory plays,And dead leaves whisper of departed days,Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.Lonely and sad, a spectre glides alongAisles where of old his living footsteps fell;No common glance discerns him, tho’ his songPeals down thro’ time with a mysterious spell:Only the few who sorcery’s secret knowEspy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe."
Laeta; a LamentBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Respectfully Dedicated to Rheinhart Kleiner, Esq.With Compliments of the AuthorHow sad droop the willows by Zulal’s fair side,Where so lately I stray’d with my raven-hair’d bride:Ev’ry light-floating lily, each flow’r on the shore,Folds in sorrow since Laeta can see them no more!Oh, blest were the days when in childhood and hopeWith my Laeta I rov’d o’er the blossom-clad slope,Plucking white meadow-daisies and ferns by the stream,As we laugh’d at the ripples that twinkle and gleam.Not a bloom deck’d the mead that could rival in graceThe dear innocent charms of my Laeta’s fair face;Not a thrush thrill’d the grove with a carol so choiceAs the silvery strains of my Laeta’s sweet voice.The shy Nymphs of the woodland, the fount and the plain,Strove to equal her beauty, but strove all in vain;Yet no envy they bore her, while fruitless they strove,For so pure was my Laeta, they could only love!When the warm breath of Auster play’d soft o’er the flow’rs,And young Zephyrus rustled the gay scented bow’rs,Ev’ry breeze seem’d to pause as it drew near the fair,Too much aw’d at her sweetness to tumble her hair.How fond were our dreams on the day when we stoodIn the ivy-grown temple beside the dark wood;When our pledges we seal’d at the sanctify’d shrine,And I knew that my Laeta forever was mine!How blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came,And the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame;Yet how heavy my heart when I first felt the fearThat my starry-eyed Laeta would fade with the year!The pastures were sere and the heavens were greyWhen I laid my lov’d Laeta forever away,And the river god pity’d, as weeping I pac’dMingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste.Now the flow’rs have return’d, but they bloom not so sweetAs in days when they blossom’d round Laeta’s dear feet;And the willows complain to the answering hill,And the thrushes that once were so happy are still.The green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine,Whilst the Dryads no more in their madrigals join,The breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs,And blows soft o’er the spot where my lov’d Laeta lies.So pensive I roam o’er the desolate lawnWhere we wander’d and lov’d in the days that are gone,And I yearn for the autumn, when Zulal’s blue tideShall sing low by my grave at the lov’d Laeta’s side."
Life’s MysteryBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Life! Ah, Life!What may this fluorescent pageant mean?Who can the evanescent object glean?He that is dead is the key of Life—Gone is the symbol, deep is the grave!Man is a breath, and Life is the fire;Birth is death, and silence the choir.Wrest from the aeons the heart of gold!Tear from the fabric the threads that are old!Life! Ah, Life!—L. Phillips Howard"
"Lines on Gen. Robert Edward LeeBorn Jan. 19, 1807By H. P. Lovecraft by Born Jan. 19, 1807By H. P. Lovecraft","“Si veris magna paraturFama bonis, et si successu nuda remotoInspicitur virtus, quicquid laudamus in ulloMajorum, fortuna fuit.”—Lucan.Whilst martial echoes o’er the wave resound,And Europe’s gore incarnadines the ground;Today no foreign hero we bemoan,But count the glowing virtues of our own!Illustrious LEE! around whose honour’d nameEntwines a patriot’s and a Christian’s fame;With whose just praise admiring nations ring,And whom repenting foes contritely sing!When first our land fraternal fury bore,And Sumter’s guns alarm’d the anxious shore;When Faction’s reign ancestral rights o’erthrew,And sunder’d States a mutual hatred knew;Then clash’d contending chiefs of kindred line,In flesh to suffer and in fame to shine.But o’er them all, majestic in his might,Rose LEE, unrivall’d, to sublimest height:With torturing choice defy’d opposing Fate,And shunn’d Temptation for his native State!Thus Washington his monarch’s rule o’erturn’dWhen young Columbia with rebellion burn’d.And what in Washington the world reveres,In LEE with equal magnitude appears.Our nation’s Father, crown’d with vict’ry’s bays,Enjoys a loving land’s eternal praise:Let, then, our hearts with equal rev’rence greetHis proud successor, rising o’er defeat!Around his greatness pour disheartening woes,But still he tow’rs above his conqu’ring foes.Silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blameTh’ unspotted leader by a traitor’s name:If such was LEE, let blushing Justice mourn,And trait’rous Liberty endure our scorn!As Philopoemen once sublimely strove,And earn’d declining Hellas’ thankful love;So follow’d LEE the purest patriot’s part,And wak’d the worship of the grateful heart:The South her soul in body’d form discerns;The North from LEE a nobler freedom learns!Attend! ye sons of Albion’s ancient race,Whate’er your country, and whate’er your place:LEE’S valiant deeds, tho’ dear to Southern song,To all our Saxon strain as well belong.Courage like his the parent Island won,And led an Empire past the setting sun;To realms unknown our laws and language bore;Rais’d England’s banner on the desert shore;Crush’d the proud rival, and subdu’d the seaFor ages past, and aeons yet to be!From Scotia’s hilly bounds the paean rolls,And Afric’s distant Cape great LEE extols;The sainted soul and manly mien combineTo grace Britannia’s and Virginia's line!As dullards now in thoughtless fervour prateOf shameful peace, and sing th’ unmanly State;As churls their piping reprobations shriek,And damn the heroes that protect the weak;Let LEE’S brave shade the timid throng accost,And give them back the manhood they have lost!What kindlier spirit, breathing from on high,Can teach us how to live and how to die?"
The MessengerBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"To Bertrand K. Hart, Esq.The thing, he said, would come that night at threeFrom the old churchyard on the hill below;But crouching by an oak fire’s wholesome glow,I tried to tell myself it could not be.Surely, I mused, it was a pleasantryDevised by one who did not truly knowThe Elder Sign, bequeathed from long ago,That sets the fumbling forms of darkness free.He had not meant it—no—but still I litAnother lamp as starry Leo climbedOut of the Seekonk, and a steeple chimedThree—and the firelight faded, bit by bit.Then at the door that cautious rattling came—And the mad truth devoured me like a flame!"
NathicanaBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"It was in the pale garden of Zaïs;The mist-shrouded gardens of Zaïs,Where blossoms the white nephalotë,The redolent herald of midnight.There slumber the still lakes of crystal,And streamlets that flow without murm’ring;Smooth streamlets from caverns of KathosWhere brood the calm spirits of twilight.And over the lakes and the streamletsAre bridges of pure alabaster,White bridges all cunningly carvenWith figures of fairies and daemons.Here glimmer strange suns and strange planets,And strange is the crescent BanapisThat sets ’yond the ivy-grown rampartsWhere thickens the dust of the evening.Here fall the white vapours of Yabon;And here in the swirl of vapoursI saw the divine Nathicana;The garlanded, white Nathicana;The slender, black-hair’d Nathicana;The sloe-ey’d, red-lipp’d Nathicana;The silver-voic’d, sweet Nathicana;The pale-rob’d, belov’d Nathicana.And ever was she my belovèd,From ages when Time was unfashion’d;From days when the stars were not fashion’dNor any thing fashion’d but Yabon.And here dwelt we ever and ever,The innocent children of Zaïs,At peace in the paths and the arbours,White-crown’d with the blest nephalotë.How oft would we float in the twilightO’er flow’r-cover’d pastures and hillsidesAll white with the lowly astalthon;The lowly yet lovely astalthon,And dream in a world made of dreamingThe dreams that are fairer than Aidenn;Bright dreams that are truer than reason!So dream’d and so lov’d we thro’ ages,Till came the curs’d season of Dzannin;The daemon-damn’d season of Dzannin;When red shone the suns and the planets,And red gleamed the crescent Banapis,And red fell the vapours of Yabon.Then redden’d the blossoms and streamletsAnd lakes that lay under the bridges,And even the calm alabasterGlow’d pink with uncanny reflectionsTill all the carv’d fairies and daemonsLeer’d redly from the backgrounds of shadow.Now redden’d my vision, and madlyI strove to peer thro’ the dense curtainAnd glimpse the divine Nathicana;The pure, ever-pale Nathicana;The lov’d, the unchang’d Nathicana.But vortex on vortex of madnessBeclouded my labouring vision;My damnable, reddening visionThat built a new world for my seeing;A new world of redness and darkness,A horrible coma call’d living.So now in this coma call’d livingI view the bright phantons of beauty;The false, hollow phantoms of beautyThat cloak all the evils of Dzannin.I view them with infinite longing,So like do they seem to my lov’d one;So shapely and fair like my lov’d one;Yet foul from their eyes shines their evil;Their cruel and pitiless evil,More evil than Thaphron and Latgoz,Twice ill for its gorgeous concealment.And only in slumbers of midnightAppears the lost maid Nathicana,The pallid, the pure Nathicana,Who fades at the glance of the dreamer.Again and again do I seek her;I woo with deep draughts of Plathotis,Deep draughts brew’d in wine of AstarteAnd strengthen’d with tears of long weeping.I yearn for the gardens of Zaïs;The lovely lost garden of ZaïsWhere blossoms the white nephalotë,The redolent herald of midnight.The last potent draught I am brewing;A draught that the daemons delight in;A draught that will banish the redness;The horrible coma call’d living.Soon, soon, if I fail not in brewing,The redness and madness will vanish,And deep in the worm-peopled darknessWill rot the base chains that hav bound me.Once more shall the gardens of ZaïsDawn white on my long-tortur’d vision,And there midst the vapours of YabonWill stand the divine Nathicana;The deathless, restor’d NathicanaWhose like is not met with in living."
NemesisBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Thro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,Past the wan-moon’d abysses of night,I have liv’d o’er my lives without number,I have sounded all things with my sight;And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.I have whirl’d with the earth at the dawning,When the sky was a vaporous flame;I have seen the dark universe yawning,Where the black planets roll without aim;Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.I had drifted o’er seas without ending,Under sinister grey-clouded skiesThat the many-fork’d lightning is rending,That resound with hysterical cries;With the moans of invisible daemons that out of the green waters rise.I have plung’d like a deer thro’ the archesOf the hoary primordial grove,Where the oaks feel the presence that marchesAnd stalks on where no spirit dares rove;And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers thro’ dead branches above.I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountainsThat rise barren and bleak from the plain,I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountainsThat ooze down to the marsh and the main;And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things I care not to gaze on again.I have scann’d the vast ivy-clad palace,I have trod its untenanted hall,Where the moon writhing up from the valleysShews the tapestried things on the wall;Strange figures discordantly woven, which I cannot endure to recall.I have peer’d from the casement in wonderAt the mouldering meadows around,At the many-roof’d village laid underThe curse of a grave-girdled ground;And from rows of white urn-carven marble I listen intently for sound.I have haunted the tombs of the ages,I have flown on the pinions of fearWhere the smoke-belching Erebus rages,Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer.I was old when the Pharaohs first mountedThe jewel-deck’d throne by the Nile;I was old in those epochs uncountedWhen I, and I only, was vile;And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle.Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,And great is the reach of its doom;Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it,Nor can respite be found in the tomb:Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.Thro’ the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,Past the wan-moon’d abysses of night,I have liv’d o’er my lives without number,I have sounded all things with my sight;And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright."
The Nightmare LakeBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"There is a lake in distant Zan,Beyond the wonted haunts of man,Where broods alone in a hideous stateA spirit dead and desolate;A spirit ancient and unholy,Heavy with fearsome melancholy,Which from the waters dull and denseDraws vapors cursed with pestilence.Around the banks, a mire of clay,Sprawl things offensive in decay,And curious birds that reach that shoreAre seen by mortals nevermore.Here shines by day the searing sunOn glassy wastes beheld by none,And here by night pale moonbeams flowInto the deeps that yawn below.In nightmares only is it toldWhat scenes beneath those beams unfold;What scenes, too old for human sight,Lie sunken there in endless night;For in those depths there only paceThe shadows of a voiceless race.One midnight, redolent of ill,I saw that lake, asleep and still;While in the lurid sky there rodeA gibbous moon that glow’d and glow’d.I saw the stretching marshy shore,And the foul things those marshes bore:Lizards and snakes convuls’d and dying;Ravens and vampires putrefying;All these, and hov’ring o’er the dead,Narcophagi that on them fed.And as the dreadful moon climb’d high,Fright’ning the stars from out the sky,I saw the lake’s dull water glowTill sunken things appear’d below.There shone unnumber’d fathoms down,The tow’rs of a forgotten town;The tarnish’d domes and mossy walls;Weed-tangled spires and empty halls;Deserted fanes and vaults of dread,And streets of gold uncoveted.These I beheld, and saw besideA horde of shapeless shadows glide;A noxious horde which to my glanceSeem’d moving in a hideous danceRound slimy sepulchres that layBeside a never-travell’d way.Straight from those tombs a heaving roseThat vex’d the waters’ dull repose,While lethal shades of upper spaceHowl’d at the moon’s sardonic face.Then sank the lake within its bed,Suck’d down to caverns of the dead,Till from the reeking, new-stript earthCurl’d foetid fumes of noisome birth.About the city, nigh uncover’d,The monstrous dancing shadows hover’d,When lo! there oped with sudden stirThe portal of each sepulchre!No ear may learn, no tongue may tellWhat nameless horror then befell.I see that lake—that moon agrin—That city and thethingswithin—Waking, I pray that on that shoreThe nightmare lake may sinkno more!"
"Ode for July Fourth, 1917By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft","As Columbia’s brave scions, in anger array’d,Once defy’d a proud monarch and built a new nation;’Gainst their brothers of Britain unsheath’d the sharp bladeThat hath ne’er met defeat nor endur’d desecration;So must we in this hourShow our valour and pow’r,And dispel the black perils that over us low’r:Whilst the sons of Britannia, no longer our foes,Will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows!See the banners of Liberty float in the breezeThat plays light o’er the regions our fathers defended;Hear the voice of the million resound o’er the leas,As the deeds of the past are proclaim’d and commended;And in splendour on highWhere our flags proudly fly,See the folds we tore down flung again to the sky:For the Emblem of England, in kinship unfurl’d,Shall divide with Old Glory the praise of the world!Bury’d now are the hatreds of subject and King,And the strife that once sunder’d an Empire hath vanish’d.With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ringAs the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish’d;And the broad British sea,Of her enemies free,Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee:For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side,Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!"
On Reading Lord Dunsany’sBook of WonderBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"The hours of night unheeded fly,And in the grate the embers fade;Vast shadows one by one pass byIn silent daemon cavalcade.But still the magic volume holdsThe raptur’d eye in realms apart,And fulgent sorcery enfoldsThe willing mind and eager heart.The lonely room no more is there—For to the sight in pomp appearTemples and cities pois’d in airAnd blazing glories—sphere on sphere."
On Receiving a Picture of SwansBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"With pensive grace the melancholy SwanMourns o’er the tomb of luckless Phaëton;On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave,And guard with tender care the wat’ry grave.Would that I might, should I too proudly claimAn Heav’nly parent, or a Godlike fame,When flown too high, and dash’d to depths below,Receive such tribute as a Cygnus’ woe!The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along,Sighs all the deeper for his want of song."
The OutpostBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"When evening cools the yellow stream,And shadows stalk the jungle’s ways,Zimbabwe’s palace flares ablazeFor a great King who fears to dream.For he alone of all mankindWaded the swamp that serpents shun;And struggling toward the setting sun,Came on the veldt that lies behind.No other eyes had vented thereSince eyes were lent for human sight—But there, as sunset turned to night,He found the Elder Secret’s lair.Strange turrets rose beyond the plain,And walls and bastions spread aroundThe distant domes that fouled the groundLike leprous fungi after rain.A grudging moon writhed up to shinePast leagues where life can have no home;And paling far-off tower and dome,Shewed each unwindowed and malign.Then he who in his boyhood ranThrough vine-hung ruins free of fear,Trembled at what he saw—for hereWas no dead, ruined seat of man.Inhuman shapes, half-seen, half-guessed,Half solid and half ether-spawned,Seethed down from starless voids that yawnedIn heav’n, to these blank walls of pest.And voidward from that pest-mad zoneAmorphous hordes seethed darkly back,Their dim claws laden with the wrackOf things that men have dreamed and known.The ancient Fishers from Outside—Were there not tales the high-priest told,Of how they found the worlds of old,And took what pelf their fancy spied?Their hidden, dread-ringed outposts broodUpon a million worlds of space;Abhorred by every living race,Yet scatheless in their solitude.Sweating with fright, the watcher creptBack to the swamp that serpents shun,So that he lay, by rise of sun,Safe in the palace where he slept.None saw him leave, or come at dawn,Nor does his flesh bear any markOf what he met in that curst dark—Yet from his sleep all peace has gone.When evening cools the yellow stream,And shadows stalk the jungle’s ways,Zimbabwe’s palace flares ablaze,For a great King who fears to dream."
Pacifist War Song—1917By H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"We are the valiant Knights of PeaceWho prattle for the Right:Our banner is of snowy fleece,Inscribed: “TOO PROUD TO FIGHT!”By sweet Chautauqua’s flow’ry banksWe love to sing and play,But should we spy a foeman’s ranks,We’d proudly run away!When Prussian fury sweeps the mainOur freedom to deny;Of tyrant laws we ne’er complain,But gladsomely comply!We do not fear the submarinesThat plough the troubled foam;We scorn the ugly old machines—And safely stay at home!They say our country’s close to war,And soon must man the guns;But we see naught to struggle for—We love the gentle Huns!What tho’ their hireling Greaser bandsInvade our southern plains?We well can spare those boist’rous lands,Content with what remains!Our fathers were both rude and bold,And would not live like brothers;But we are of a finer mould—We’re much more like our mothers!"

Lovecraft,"(Supposed to be a “pome,” but cast strictly in modern metre.)The vicar sat in the firelight’s glow,A volume in his hand;And a tear he shed for the widespread woe,And the anguish brought by the vicious foeThat overran the land.But ne’er a hand for his King rais’d he,For he was a man of peace;And he car’d not a whit for the victoryThat must come to preserve his nation free,And the world from fear release.His son had buckled on his sword,The first at the front was he;But the vicar his valiant child ignor’d,And his noble deeds in the field deplor’d,For he knew not bravery.On his flock he strove to fix his will,And lead them to scorn the fray.He told them that conquest brings but ill;That meek submission would serve them stillTo keep the foe away.In vain did he hear the bugle’s soundThat strove to avert the fall.The land, quoth he, is all men’s ground,What matter if friend or foe be foundAs master of us all?One day from the village green hard byThe vicar heard a roarOf cannon that rivall’d the anguish’d cryOf the hundreds that liv’d, but wish’d to dieAs the enemy rode them o’er.Now he sees his own cathedral shakeAt the foeman’s wanton aim.The ancient tow’rs with the bullets quake;The steeples fall, the foundations break,And the whole is lost in flame.Up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade,And the vicar, and daughter, and wifeScream out in vain for the needed aidThat only a regiment might have madeEre they lose what is more than life.Then quick to his brain came manhood’s thought,As he saw his erring course;And the vicar his dusty rifle broughtThat the foe might at least by one be fought,And force repaid with force.One shot—the enemy’s blasting fireA breach in the wall cuts thro’,But the vicar replies with his waken’d ire;Fells one arm’d brute for each fallen spire,And in blood is born anew.Two shots—the wife and daughter sink,Each with a mortal wound;And the vicar, too madden’d by far to think,Rushes boldly on to death’s vague brink,With the manhood he has found.Three shots—but shots of another kindThe smoky regions rend;And upon the foeman with rage gone blind,Like a ceaseless, resistless, avenging wind,The rescuing troops descend.The smoke-pall clears, and the vicar’s sonHis father’s life has sav’d;And the vicar looks o’er the ruin done,Ere the vict’ry by his child was won,His face with care engrav’d.The vicar sat in the firelight’s glow,The volume in his hand,That brought to his hearth the bitter woeWhich only a husband and father can know,And truly understand.With a chasten’d mien he flung the bookTo the leaping flames before;And a breath of sad relief he tookAs the pages blacken’d beneath his look—The fool of Peace no more!EpilogueThe rev’rend parson, wak’d to man’s estate,Laments his wife’s and daughter’s common fate.His martial son in warm embrace enfolds,And clings the tighter to the child he holds.His peaceful notions, banish’d in an hour,Will nevermore his wit or sense devour;But steep’d in truth, ’tis now his nobler planTo cure, yet recognise, the faults of man."
The Poe-et’s NightmareBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"A FableLuxus tumultus semper causa est.Lucullus Languish, student of the skies,And connoisseur of rarebits and mince pies,A bard by choice, a grocer’s clerk by trade,(Grown pessimist thro’ honours long delay’d),A secret yearning bore, that he might shineIn breathing numbers, and in song divine.Each day his fountain pen was wont to dropAn ode or dirge or two about the shop,Yet naught could strike the chord within his heartThat throbb’d for poesy, and cry’d for art.Each eve he sought his bashful Muse to wakeWith overdoses of ice-cream and cake;But thou’ th’ ambitious youth a dreamer grew,Th’ Aonian Nymph declin’d to come to view.Sometimes at dusk he scour’d the heav’ns afar,Searching for raptures in the evening star;One night he strove to catch a tale untoldIn crystal deeps—but only caught a cold.So pin’d Lucullus with his lofty woe,Till one drear day he bought a set of Poe:Charm’d with the cheerful horrors there display’d,He vow’d with gloom to woo the Heav’nly Maid.Of Auber’s tarn and Yaanek’s slope he dreams,And weaves an hundred Ravens in his schemes.Not far from our young hero’s peaceful homeLies the fair grove wherein he loves to roam.Tho’ but a stunted copse in vacant lot,He dubs it Tempe, and adores the spot;When shallow puddles dot the wooded plain,And brim o’er muddy banks with muddy rain,He calls them limpid lakes or poison pools(Depending on which bard his fancy rules).’Tis here he comes with Heliconian fireOn Sundays when he smites the Attic lyre;And here one afternoon he brought his gloom,Resolv’d to chant a poet’s lay of doom.Roget’s Thesaurus, and a book of rhymes,Provide the rungs whereon his spirit climbs:With this grave retinue he trod the groveAnd pray’d the Fauns he might a Poe-et prove.But sad to tell, ere Pegasus flew high,The not unrelish’d supper hour drew nigh;Our tuneful swain th’ imperious call attends,And soon above the groaning table bends.Tho’ it were too prosaic to relateTh’ exact particulars of what he ate(Such long-drawn lists the hasty reader skips,Like Homer’s well-known catalogue of ships),This much we swear: that as adjournment near’d,A monstrous lot of cake had disappear’d!Soon to his chamber the young bard repairs,And courts soft Somnus with sweet Lydian airs;Thro’ open casement scans the star-strown deep,And ’neath Orion’s beams sinks off to sleep.Now start from airy dell the elfin trainThat dance each midnight o’er the sleeping plain,To bless the just, or cast a warning spellOn those who dine not wisely, but too well.First Deacon Smith they plague, whose nasal glowComes from what Holmes hath call’d “Elixir Pro”;Group’d round the couch his visage they deride,Whilst thro’ his dreams unnumber’d serpents glide.Next troop the little folk into the roomWhere snores our young Endymion, swath’d in gloom:A smile lights up his boyish face, whilst heDreams of the moon—or what he ate at tea.The chieftain elf th’ unconscious youth surveys,And on his form a strange enchantment lays:Those lips, that lately thrill’d with frosted cake,Uneasy sounds in slumbrous fashion make;At length their owner’s fancies they rehearse,And lisp this awesome Poe-em in blank verse:Aletheia PhrikodesOmnia risus et omnia pulvis et omnia nihil.Demoniac clouds, up-pil’d in chasmy reachOf soundless heav’n, smother’d the brooding night;Nor came the wonted whisp’rings of the swamp,Nor voice of autumn wind along the moor,Nor mutter’d noises of th’ insomnious groveWhose black recesses never saw the sun.Within that grove a hideous hollow lies,Half bare of trees; a pool in centre lurksThat none dares sound; a tarn of murky face(Tho’ naught can prove its hue, since light of day,Affrighted, shuns the forest-shadow’d banks).Hard by, a yawning hillside grotto breathes,From deeps unvisited, a dull, dank airThat sears the leaves on certain stunted treesWhich stand about, clawing the spectral gloomWith evil boughs.  To this accursed dellCome woodland creatures, seldom to depart:Once I behold, upon a crumbling stoneSet altar-like before the cave, a thingI saw not clearly, yet from glimpsing, fled.In this half-dusk I meditate aloneAt many a weary noontide, when withoutA world forgets me in its sun-blest mirth.Here howl by night the werewolves, and the soulsOf those that knew me well in other days.Yet on this night the grove spake not to me;Nor spake the swamp, nor wind along the moor,Nor moan’d the wind about the lonely eavesOf the bleak, haunted pile wherein I lay.I was afraid to sleep, or quench the sparkOf the low-burning taper by my couch.I was afraid when thro’ the vaulted spaceOf the old tow’r, the clock-ticks died awayInto a silence so profound and chillThat my teeth chatter’d—giving yet no sound.Then flicker’d low the light, and all dissolv’d,Leaving me floating in the hellish graspOf body’d blackness, from whose beating wingsCame ghoulish blasts of charnel-scented mist.Things vague, unseen, unfashion’d, and unnam’dJostled each other in the seething voidThat gap’d, chaotic, downward to a seaOf speechless horror, foul with writhing thoughts.All this I felt, and felt the mocking eyesOf the curs’d universe upon my soul;Yet naught I saw nor heard, till flash’d a beamOf lurid lustre thro’ the rotting heav’ns,Playing on scenes I labour’d not to see.Methought the nameless tarn, alight at last,Reflected shapes, and more reveal’d withinThose shocking depths than ne’er were seen before;Methought from out the cave a demon train,Grinning and smirking, reel’d in fiendish rout;Bearing within their reeking paws a loadOf carrion viands for an impious feast.Methought the stunted trees with hungry armsGrop’d greedily for things I dare not name;The while a stifling, wraith-like noisomenessFill’d all the dale, and spoke a larger lifeOf uncorporeal hideousness awakeIn the half-sentient wholeness of the spot.Now glow’d the ground, and tarn, and cave, and trees,And moving forms, and things not spoken of,With such a phosphorescence as men glimpseIn the putrescent thickets of the swampWhere logs decaying lie, and rankness reigns.Methought a fire-mist drap’d with lucent foldThe well-remember’d features of the grove,Whilst whirling ether bore in eddying streamsThe hot, unfinish’d stuff of nascent worldsHither and thither thro’ infinitiesOf light and darkness, strangely intermix’d;Wherein all entity had consciousness,Without th’ accustom’d outward shape of life.Of these swift-circling currents was my soul,Free from the flesh, a true constituent part;Nor felt I less myself, for want of form.Then clear’d the mist, and o’er a star-strown scene,Divine and measureless, I gaz’d in awe.Alone in space, I view’d a feeble fleckOf silvern light, marking the narrow kenWhich mortals call the boundless universe.On ev’ry side, each as a tiny star,Shone more creations, vaster than our own,And teeming with unnumber’d forms of life;Tho’ we as life would recognise it not,Being bound to earthy thoughts of human mould.As on a moonless night the Milky WayIn solid sheen displays its countless orbsTo weak terrestrial eyes, each orb a sun;So beam’d the prospect on my wond’ring soul:A spangled curtain, rich with twinkling gems,Yet each a mighty universe of suns.But as I gaz’d, I sens’d a spirit voiceIn speech didactic, tho’ no voice it was,Save as it carried thought.  It bade me markThat all the universes in my viewForm’d but an atom in infinity;Whose reaches pass the ether-laden realmsOf heat and light, extending to far fieldsWhere flourish worlds invisible and vague,Fill’d with strange wisdom and uncanny life,And yet beyond; to myriad spheres of light,To spheres of darkness, to abysmal voidsThat know the pulses of disorder’d force.Big with these musings, I survey’d the surgeOf boundless being, yet I us’d not eyes,For spirit leans not on the props of sense.The docent presence swell’d my strength of soul;All things I knew, but knew with mind alone.Time’s endless vista spread before my thoughtWith its vast pageant of unceasing changeAnd sempiternal strife of force and will;I saw the ages flow in stately streamPast rise and fall of universe and life;I saw the birth of suns and worlds, their death,Their transmutation into limpid flame,Their second birth and second death, their coursePerpetual thro’ the aeons’ termless flight,Never the same, yet born again to serveThe varying purpose of omnipotence.And whilst I watch’d, I knew each second’s spaceWas greater than the lifetime of our world.Then turn’d my musings to that speck of dustWhereon my form corporeal took its rise;That speck, born but a second, which must dieIn one brief second more; that fragile earth;That crude experiment; that cosmic sportWhich holds our proud, aspiring race of mitesAnd moral vermin; those presuming mitesWhom ignorance with empty pomp adorns,And misinstructs in specious dignity;Those mites who, reas’ning outward, vaunt themselvesAs the chief work of Nature, and enjoyIn fatuous fancy the particular careOf all her mystic, super-regnant pow’r.And as I strove to vision the sad sphereWhich lurk’d, lost in ethereal vortices,Methough my soul, tun’d to the infinite,Refus’d to glimpse that poor atomic blight;That misbegotten accident of space;That globe of insignificance, whereon(My guide celestial told me) dwells no partOf empyrean virtue, but where breedThe coarse corruptions of divine disease;The fest’ring ailments of infinity;The morbid matter by itself call’d man:Such matter (said my guide) as oft breaks forthOn broad Creation’s fabric, to annoyFor a brief instant, ere assuaging deathHeal up the malady its birth provok’d.Sicken’d, I turn’d my heavy thoughts away.Then spake th’ ethereal guide with mocking mien,Upbraiding me for searching after Truth;Visiting on my mind the searing scornOf mind superior; laughing at the woeWhich rent the vital essence of my soul.Methought he brought remembrance of the timeWhen from my fellows to the grove I stray’d,In solitude and dusk to meditateOn things forbidden, and to pierce the veilOf seeming good and seeming beauteousnessThat covers o’er the tragedy of Truth,Helping mankind forget his sorry lot,And raising Hope where Truth would crush it down.He spake, and as he ceas’d, methought the flamesOf fuming Heav’n resolv’d in torments dire;Whirling in maelstroms of rebellious might,Yet ever bound by laws I fathom’d not.Cycles and epicycles, of such girthThat each a cosmos seem’d, dazzled my gazeTill all a wild phantasmal glow became.Now burst athwart the fulgent formlessnessA rift of purer sheen, a sight supernal,Broader that all the void conceiv’d by man,Yet narrow here.  A glimpse of heav’ns beyond;Of weird creations so remote and greatThat ev’n my guide assum’d a tone of awe.Borne on the wings of stark immensity,A touch of rhythm celestial reach’d my soul;Thrilling me more with horror than with joy.Again the spirit mock’d my human pangs,And deep revil’d me for presumptuous thoughts:Yet changing now his mien, he bade me scanThe wid’ning rift that clave the walls of space;He bade me search it for the ultimate;He bade me find the Truth I sought so long;He bade me brave th’ unutterable Thing,The final Truth of moving entity.All this he bade and offer’d—but my soul,Clinging to life, fled without aim or knowledge,Shrieking in silence thro’ the gibbering deeps.Thus shriek’d the young Lucullus, as he fledThro’ gibbering deeps—and tumbled out of bed;Within the room the morning sunshine gleams,Whilst the poor youth recalls his troubled dreams.He feels his aching limbs, whose woeful painInforms his soul his body lives again,And thanks his stars—or cosmoses—or suchThat he survives the noxious nightmare’s clutch.Thrill’d with the music of th’ eternal spheres(Or is it the alarm-clock that he hears?),He vows to all the Pantheon, high and low,No more to feed on cake, or pie, or Poe.And now his gloomy spirits seem to rise,As he the world beholds with clearer eyes;The cup he thought too full of dregs to quaffAffords him wine enough to raise a laugh.(All this is metaphor—you must not thinkOur late Endymion prone to stronger drink!)With brighter visage and with lighter heart,He turns his fancies to the grocer’s mart;And strange to say, at last he seems to findHis daily duties worthy of his mind.Since Truth prov’d such a high and dang’rous goal,Our bard seeks one less trying to his soul;With deep-drawn breath he flouts his dreary woes,And a good clerk from a bad poet grows!Now close attend my lay, ye scribbling crewThat bay the moon in numbers strange and new;That madly for the spark celestial bawlIn metres short or long, or none at all:Curb your rash force, in numbers or at tea,Nor overzealous for high fancies be;Reflect, ere ye the draught Pierian take,What worthy clerks or plumbers ye might make;Wax not too frenzied in the leaping lineThat neither sense nor measure can confine,Lest ye, like young Lucullus Launguish, groanBeneath Poe-etic nightmares of your own!"

ProvidenceBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"Where bay and river tranquil blend,And leafy hillsides rise,The spires of Providence ascendAgainst the ancient skies.Here centuried domes of shining goldSalute the morning’s glare,While slanting gables, odd and old,Are scatter’d here and there.And in the narrow winding waysThat climb o’er slope and crest,The magic of forgotten daysMay still be found to rest.A fanlight’s gleam, a knocker’s blow,A glimpse of Georgian brick—The sights and sounds of long agoWhere fancies cluster thick.A flight of steps with iron rail,A belfry looming tall,A slender steeple, carv’d and pale,A moss-grown garden wall.A hidden churchyard’s crumbling proofsOf man’s mortality,A rotting wharf where gambrel roofsKeep watch above the sea.Square and parade, whose walls have tower’dFull fifteen decades longBy cobbled ways ’mid trees embower’d,And slighted by the throng.Stone bridges spanning languid streams,Houses perch’d on the hill,And courts where mysteries and dreamsThe brooding spirit fill.Steep alley steps by vines conceal’d,Where small-pan’d windows glowAt twilight on a bit of fieldThat chance has left below.My Providence!  What airy hostsTurn still thy gilded vanes;What winds of elf that with grey ghostsPeople thine ancient lanes!The chimes of evening as of oldAbove thy valleys sound,While thy stern fathers ’neath the mouldMake blest thy sacred ground.Thou dream’st beside the waters there,Unchang’d by cruel years;A spirit from an age more fairThat shines behind our tears.Thy twinkling lights each night I see,Tho’ time and space divide;For thou art of the soul of me,And always at my side!"
Psychopompos: A Tale in RhymeBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"I am He who howls in the night;I am He who moans in the snow;I am He who hath never seen light;I am He who mounts from below.My car is the car of Death;My wings are the wings of dread;My breath is the north wind’s breath;My prey are the cold and the dead.In old Auvergne, when schools were poor and few,And peasants fancy’d what they scarcely knew,When lords and gentry shunn’d their Monarch’s throneFor solitary castles of their own,There dwelt a man of rank, whose fortress stoodIn the hush’d twilight of a hoary wood.De Blois his name; his lineage high and vast,A proud memorial of an honour’d past;But curious swains would whisper now and thenThat Sieur De Blois was not as other men.In person dark and lean, with glossy hair,And gleaming teeth that he would often bare,With piercing eye, and stealthy roving glance,And tongue that clipt the soft, sweet speech of France;The Sieur was little lov’d and seldom seen,So close he kept within his own demesne.The castle servants, few, discreet, and old,Full many a tale of strangeness might have told;But bow’d with years, they rarely left the doorWherein their sires and grandsires serv’d before.Thus gossip rose, as gossip rises best,When mystery imparts a keener zest;Seclusion oft the poison tongue attracts,And scandal prospers on a dearth of facts.’Twas said, the Sieur had more than once been spy’dAlone at midnight by the river’s side,With aspect so uncouth, and gaze so strange,That rustics cross’d themselves to see the change;Yet none, when press’d, could clearly say or knowJust what it was, or why they trembled so.De Blois, as rumour whisper’d, fear’d to pray,Nor us’d his chapel on the Sabbath day;Howe’er this may have been, ’twas known at leastHis household had no chaplain, monk, or priest.But if the Master liv’d in dubious fame,Twice fear’d and hated was his noble Dame;As dark as he, in features wild and proud,And with a weird supernal grace endow’d,The haughty mistress scorn’d the rural trainWho sought to learn her source, but sought in vain.Old women call’d her eyes too bright by half,And nervous children shiver’d at her laugh;Richard, the dwarf (whose word had little weight),Vow’d she was like a serpent in her gait,Whilst ancient Pierre (the aged often err)Laid all her husband’s mystery to her.Still more absurd were those odd mutter’d thingsThat calumny to curious list’ners brings;Those subtle slanders, told with downcast face,And muffled voice—those tales no man may trace;Tales that the faith of old wives can command,Tho’ always heard at sixth or seventh hand.Thus village legend darkly would implyThat Dame De Blois possess’d an evil eye;Or going further, furtively suggestA lurking spark of sorcery in her breast;Old Mère Allard (herself half witch) once saidThe lady’s glance work’d strangely on the dead.So liv’d the pair, like many another twoThat shun the crowd, and shrink from public view.They scorn’d the doubts by ev’ry peasant shewn,And ask’d but one thing—to be let alone!’Twas Candlemas, the dreariest time of year,With fall long gone, and spring too far to cheer,When little Jean, the bailiff’s son and heir,Fell sick and threw the doctors in despair.A child so stout and strong that few would thinkAn hour might carry him to death’s dark brink,Yet pale he lay, tho’ hidden was the cause,And Galens search’d in vain thro’ Nature’s laws.But stricken sadness could not quite suppressThe roving thought, or wrinkled grandam’s guess:Tho’ spoke by stealth, ’twas known to half a scoreThat Dame De Blois rode by the day before;She had (they said) with glances weird and wildPaus’d by the gate to view the prattling child,Nor did they like the smile which seem’d to traceNew lines of evil on her proud, dark face.These things they whisper’d, when the mother’s cryTold of the end—the gentle soul gone by;In genuine grief the kindly watcher wept,Whilst the lov’d babe with saints and angels slept.The village priest his simple rites went thro’,And good Michel nail’d up the box of yew;Around the corpse the holy candles burn’d,The mourners sighed, the parents dumbly yearn’d.Then one by one each sought his humble bed,And left the lonely mother with her dead.Late in the night it was, when o’er the valeThe storm-king swept with pandemoniac gale;Deep pil’d the cruel snow, yet strange to tell,The lightning sputter’d while the white flakes fell;A hideous presence seem’d abroad to steal,And terror sounded in the thunder’s peal.Within the house of grief the tapers glow’dWhilst the poor mother bow’d beneath her load;Her salty eyes too tired now to weep,Too pain’d to see, too sad to close in sleep.The clock struck three, above the tempest heard,When something near the lifeless infant stirr’d;Some slipp’ry thing, that flopp’d in awkward way,And climb’d the table where the coffin lay;With scaly convolutions strove to findThe cold, still clay that death had left behind.The nodding mother hears—starts broad awake—Empower’d to reason, yet too stunn’d to shake;The pois’nous thing she sees, and nimbly foilsThe ghoulish purpose of the quiv’ring coils:With ready axe the serpent’s head she cleaves,And thrills with savage triumph whilst she grieves.The injur’d reptile hissing glides from sight,And hides its cloven carcass in the night.The weeks slipp’d by, and gossip’s tongue beganTo call the Sieur De Blois an alter’d man;With curious mien he oft would pace alongThe village street, and eye the gaping throng.Yet whilst he shew’d himself as ne’er before,His wild-eyed lady was observ’d no more.In course of time, ’twas scarce thought odd or illThat he his ears with village lore should fill;Nor was the town with special rumour rifeWhen he sought out the bailiff and his wife:Their tale of sorrow, with its ghastly end,Was told, indeed, by ev’ry wond’ring friend.The Sieur heard all, and low’ring rode away,Nor was he seen again for many a day.When vernal sunshine shed its cheering glow,And genial zephyrs blew away the snow,To frighten’d swains a horror was reveal’dIn the damp herbage of a melting field.There (half preserv’d by winter’s frigid bed)Lay the dark Dame De Blois, untimely dead;By some assassin’s stroke most foully slain,Her shapely brow and temples cleft in twain.Reluctant hands the dismal burden boreTo the stone arches of the husband’s door,Where silent serfs the ghastly thing receiv’d,Trembling with fright, but less amaz’d than griev’d;The Sieur his dame beheld with blazing eyes,And shook with anger, more than with surprise.(At least ’tis thus the stupid peasants toldTheir wide-mouth’d wives when they the tale unroll’d.)The village wonder’d why De Blois had keptHis spouse’s loss unmention’d and unwept,Nor were there lacking sland’rous tongues to claimThat the dark master was himself to blame.But village talk could scarcely hope to solveA crime so deep, and thus the months revolve:The rural train repeat the gruesome tale,And gape and marvel more than they bewail.Swift flew the sun, and winter once againWith icy talons gripp’d the frigid plain.December brought its store of Christmas cheer,And grateful peasants hail’d the op’ning year;But by the hearth as Candlemas drew nigh,The whisp’ring ancients spoke of things gone by.Few had forgot the dark demoniac loreOf things that came the Candlemas before,And many a crone intently eyed the houseWhere dwelt the sadden’d bailiff and his spouse.At last the day arriv’d, the sky o’erspreadWith dark’ning messengers and clouds of lead;Each neighb’ring grove Aeolian warnings sigh’d,And thick’ning terrors broadcast seem’d to bide.The good folk, tho’ they knew not why, would runSwift past the bailiff’s door, the scene to shun;Within the house the grieving couple wept,And mourn’d the child who now forever slept.On rush’d the dusk in doubly hideous form,Borne on the pinions of the gath’ring storm;Unusual murmurs fill’d the rainless wind,The rising river lash’d the troubled shore;Black thro’ the night the awful storm-god prowl’d,And froze the list’ners’ life-blood as he howl’d;Gigantic trees like supple rushes sway’d,Whilst for his home the trembling cotter pray’d.Now falls a sudden lull amidst the gale;With less’ning force the circling currents wail;Far down the stream that laves the neighb’ring meadBurst a new ululation, wildly key’d;The peasant train a frantic mien assume,And huddle closer in the spectral gloom:To each strain’d ear the truth too well is known,For that dread sound can come from wolves alone!The rustics close attend, when ere they think,A lupine army swarms the river’s brink;From out the waters leap a howling trainThat rend the air, and scatter o’er the plain:With flaming orbs the frothing creatures fly,And chant with hellish voice their hungry cry.First of the pack a mighty monster leapsWith fearless tread, and martial order keeps;Th’ attendant wolves his yelping tones obey,And form in columns for the coming fray:No frighten’d swain they harm, but silent boundWith a fix’d purpose o’er the frozen ground.Straight course the monsters thro’ the village street,Unholy vigour in their flying feet;Thro’ half-shut blinds the shelter’d peasants peer,And wax in wonder as they lose in fear.Th’ excited pack at last their goal perceive,And the vex’d air with deaf’ning clamour cleave;The churls, astonish’d, watch th’ unnatural herdFlock round a cottage at the leader’s word:Quick spreads the fearsome fact, by rumour blown,That the doom’d cottage is the bailiff’s own!Round and around the howling daemons glide,Whilst the fierce leader scales the vine-clad side;The frantic wind its horrid wail renews,And mutters madly thro’ the lifeless yews.In the frail house the bailiff calmly waitsThe rav’ning horde, and trusts th’ impartial Fates,But the wan wife revives with curious mienAnother monster and an older scene;Amidst th’ increasing wind that rocks the walls,The dame to him the serpent’s deed recalls:Then as a nameless thought fills both their minds,The bare-fang’d leader crashes thro’ the blinds.Across the room, with murd’rous fury rife,Leaps the mad wolf, and seizes on the wife;With strange intent he drags his shrieking preyClose to the spot where once the coffin lay.Wilder and wilder roars the mounting galeThat sweeps the hills and hurtles thro’ the vale;The ill-made cottage shakes, the pack withoutDance with new fury in demoniac rout.Quick as his thought, the valiant bailiff standsAbove the wolf, a weapon in his hands;The ready axe that serv’d a year before,Now serves as well to slay one monster more.The creature drops inert, with shatter’d head,Full on the floor, and silent as the dead;The rescu’d wife recalls the dire alarms,And faints from terror in her husband’s arms.But as he holds her, all the cottage quakes,And with full force the titan tempest breaks:Down crash the walls, and o’er their shrinking formsBurst the mad revels of the storm of storms.Th’ encircling wolves advance with ghastly pace,Hunger and murder in each gleaming face,But as they close, from out the hideous nightFlashes a bolt of unexpected light:The vivid scene to ev’ry eye appears,And peasants shiver with returning fears.Above the wreck the scatheless chimney stays,Its outline glimm’ring in the fitful rays,Whilst o’er the hearth still hangs the household shrine,The Saviour’s image and the Cross divine!Round the blest spot a lambent radiance glows,And shields the cotters from their stealthy foes:Each monstrous creature marks the wondrous glare,Drops, fades, and vanishes in empty air!The village train with startled eyes adore,And count their beads in rev’rence o’er and o’er.Now fades the light, and dies the raging blast,The hour of dread and reign of horror past.Pallid and bruis’d, from out his toppled wallsThe panting bailiff with his good wife crawls:Kind hands attend them, whilst o’er all the townA strange sweet peace of spirit settles down.Wonder and fear are still’d in soothing sleep,As thro’ the breaking clouds the moon rays peep.Here paus’d the prattling grandam in her speech,Confus’d with age, the tale half out of reach;The list’ning guest, impatient for a clue,Fears ’tis not one tale, but a blend of two;He fain would know how far’d the widow’d lordWhose eerie ways th’ initial theme afford,And marvels that the crone so quick should slightHis fate, to babble of the wolf-wrack’d night.The old wife, press’d, for greater clearness strives,Nods wisely, and her scatter’d wits revives;Yet strangely lingers on her latter taleOf wolf and bailiff, miracle and gale.When (quoth the crone) the dawn’s bright radiance bath’dTh’ eventful scene, so late in terror swath’d,The chatt’ring churls that sought the ruin’d cotFound a new marvel in the gruesome spot.From fallen walls a trail of gory red,As of the stricken wolf, erratic led;O’er road and mead the new-dript crimson wound,Till lost amidst the neighb’ring swampy ground:With wonder unappeas’d the peasants burn’d,For what the quicksand takes is ne’er return’d.Once more the grandam, with a knowing eye,Stops in her tale, to watch a hawk soar by;The weary list’ner, baffled, seeks anewFor some plain statement, or enlight’ning clue.Th’ indulgent crone attends the puzzled plea,Yet strangely mutters o’er the mystery.The Sieur?  Ah, yes—that morning all in vainHis shaking servants scour’d the frozen plain;No man had seen him since he rode awayIn silence on the dark preceding day.His horse, wild-eyed with some unusual fright,Came wand’ring from the river-bank that night.His hunting-hound, that mourn’d with piteous woe,Howl’d by the quicksand swamp, his grief to shew.The village folk thought much, but utter’d less;The servants’ search wore out in emptiness:For Sieur De Blois (the old wife’s tale is o’er)Was lost to mortal sight for evermore."
RevelationBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"In a vale of light and laughter,Shining ’neath the friendly sun,Where fulfilment follow’d afterEv’ry hope or dream begun;Where an Aidenn gay and glorious,Beckon’d down the winsome way;There my soul, o’er pain victorious,Laugh’d and lingered—yesterday.Green and narrow was my valley,Temper’d with a verdant shade;Sun-deck’d brooklets musicallySparkled thro’ each glorious glade;And at night the stars serenelyGlow’d betwixt the boughs o’erhead,While Astarte, calm and queenly,Floods of fairy radiance shed.There amid the tinted bowers,Raptur’d with the opiate spellOf the grasses, ferns, and flowers,Poppy, phlox and pimpernel,Long I lay, entranc’d and dreaming,Pleas’d with Nature’s bounteous store,Till I mark’d the shaded gleamingOf the sky, and yearn’d for more.Eagerly the branches tearing,Clear’d I all the space above,Till the bolder gaze, high faring,Scann’d the naked skies of Jove;Deeps unguess’d now shone before me,Splendid beam’d the solar car;Wings of fervid fancy bore meOut beyond the farthest star.Reaching, gasping, wishing, longingFor the pageant brought to sight,Vain I watch’d the gold orbs throngingRound celestial poles of light.Madly on a moonbeam ladderHeav’n’s abyss I sought to scale,Ever wiser, ever sadder,As the fruitless task would fail.Then, with futile striving sated,Veer’d my soul to earth again,Well content that I was fatedFor a fair, yet low domain;Pleasing thoughts of glad tomorrows,Like the blissful moments past,Lull’d to rest my transient sorrows,Still’d my godless greed at last.But my downward glance, returning,Shrank in fright from what it spy’d;Slopes in hideous torment burning,Terror in the brooklet’s tide:For the dell, of shade denudedBy my desecrating hand,’Neath the bare sky blaz’d and broodedAs a lost, accursed land."
The Rose of EnglandBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"At morn the rosebud greets the sunAnd sheds the evening dew,Expanding ere the day is done,In bloom of radiant hue;And when the sun his rest hath found,Rose-petals strow the garden round!Thus that blest Isle that owns the RoseFrom mist and darkness came,A million glories to disclose,And spread BRITANNIA’S name;And ere Life’s Sun shall leave the blue,ENGLAND shall reign the whole world thro’!"
SunsetBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"The cloudless day is richer at its close;A golden glory settles on the lea;Soft, stealing shadows hint of cool reposeTo mellowing landscape, and to calming sea.And in that nobler, gentler, lovelier light,The soul to sweeter, loftier bliss inclines;Freed form the noonday glare, the favour’d sightIncreasing grace in earth and sky divines.But ere the purest radiance crowns the green,Or fairest lustre fills th’ expectant grove,The twilight thickens, and the fleeting sceneLeaves but a hallow’d memory of love!"
"To Clark Ashton Smith, Esq.,upon His Phantastick Tales,Verses, Pictures, and SculpturesBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft","A time-black tower against dim banks of cloud;Around its base the pathless, pressing wood.Shadow and silence, moss and mould, enshroudGrey, age-fell’d slabs that once as cromlechs stood.No fall of foot, no song of bird awakesThe lethal aisles of sempiternal night,Tho’ oft with stir of wings the dense air shakes,As in the tower there glows a pallid light.For here, apart, dwells one whose hands have wroughtStrange eidola that chill the world with fear;Whose graven runes in tones of dread have taughtWhat things beyond the star-gulfs lurk and leer.Dark Lord of Averoigne—whose windows stareOn pits of dream no other gaze could bear!"
"To Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett,Eighteenth Baron DunsanyBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft","As when the sun above a dusky woldSprings into sight, and turns the gloom to gold,Lights with his magic beams the dew-deck’d bow’rs,And wakes to life the gay responsive flow’rs;So now o’er realms where dark’ning dulness lies,In solar state see shiningPlunkettrise!Monarch of Fancy! whose ethereal mindMounts fairy peaks, and leaves the throng behind;Whose soul untainted bursts the bounds of space,And leads to regions of supernal grace;Can any praise thee with too strong a tone,Who in this age of folly gleam’st alone?Thy quill,Dunsany,with an art divineRecalls the gods to each deserted shrine;From mystic air a novel pantheon makes,And with new spirits fills the meads and brakes;With thee we wander thro’ primeval bow’rs,For thou hast brought earth’s childhood back, and ours!How leaps the soul, with sudden bliss increas’d,When led by thee to lands beyond the East!Sick of this sphere, in crime and conflict old,We yearn for wonders distant and untold;O’er Homer’s page a second time we pore,And rack our brains for gleams of infant lore:But all in vain—for valiant tho’ we striveNo common means these pictures can revive.Then dawnsDunsanywith celestial light,And fulgent visions break upon our sight:His barque enchanted each sad spirit bearsTo shores of gold, beyond the reach of cares.No earthly trammels now our thoughts may chain;For childhood’s fancy hath come back again!What glitt’ring worlds now wait our eager eyes!What roads untrodden beckon thro’ the skies!Wonders on wonders line the gorgeous ways,And glorious vistas greet the ravish’d gaze;Mountains of clouds, castles of crystal dreams,Ethereal cities and Elysian streams;Temples of blue, where myriad stars adoreForgotten gods of aeons gone before!Such are thine arts,Dunsany,such thy skill,That scarce terrestrial seems thy moving quill;Can man, and man alone, successful drawSuch scenes of wonder and domains of awe?Our hearts, enraptur’d, fix thy mind’s abodeIn highPegāna;hail thee as a god;And sure, can aught more high or godlike beThan such a fancy as resides in thee?Delighted Pan a friend and peer perceivesAs thy sweet music stirs the sylvan leaves;The Nine, transported, bless thy golden lyre,Approve thy fancy, and applaud thy fire;Whilst Jove himself assumes a brother’s tone,And vows the pantheon equal to his own.Dunsany,may thy days be glad and long;Replete with visions, and atune with song;May thy rare notes increasing millions cheer,Thy name beloved, and thy mem’ry dear!’Tis thou who hast in hours of dulness broughtNew charms of language, and new gems of thought;Hast with a poet’s grace enrich’d the earthWith aureate dreams as noble as thy birth.Grateful we name thee, bright with fix’d renown,The fairest jewel inHibernia’scrown."
"Unda; or, The Bride of the SeaBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft","Respectfully Dedicated with Permission to MAURICE WINTER MOE, Esq.A Dull, Dark, Drear, Dactylic Delirium in Sixteen Silly, Senseless, Sickly Stanzas“Ego, canus, lunam cano.”—Maevius Bavianus.Black loom the crags of the uplands behind me;Dark are the sands of the far-stretching shore.Dim are the pathways and rocks that remind meSadly of years in the lost nevermore.Soft laps the ocean on wave-polish’d boulder;Sweet is the sound and familiar to me.Here, with her head gently bent to my shoulder,Walk’d I with Unda, the Bride of the Sea.Bright was the morn of my youth when I met her,Sweet as the breeze that blew in o’er the brine.Swift was I captur’d in Love’s strongest fetter,Glad to be hers, and she glad to be mine.Never a question ask’d I where she wander’d,Never a question ask’d she of my birth:Happy as children, we thought not nor ponder’d,Glad with the bounty of ocean and earth.Once when the moonlight play’d soft ’mid the billows,High on the cliff o’er the waters we stood,Bound was her hair with a garland of willows,Pluck’d by the fount in the bird-haunted wood.Strangely she gaz’d on the surges beneath her,Charm’d by the sound or entranc’d by the light.Then did the waves a wild aspect bequeath her,Stern as the ocean and weird as the night.Coldly she left me, astonish’d and weeping,Standing alone ’mid the regions she bless’d:Down, ever downward, half gliding, half creeping,Stole the sweet Unda in oceanward quest.Calm grew the sea, and tumultuous beatingTurn’d to a ripple, as Unda the fairTrod the wet sands in affectionate greeting,Beckon’d to me, and no longer was there!Long did I pace by the banks where she vanish’d:High climb’d the moon, and descended again.Grey broke the dawn till the sad night was banish’d,Still ach’d my soul with its infinite pain.All the wide world have I search’d for my darling,Scour’d the far deserts and sail’d distant seas.Once on the wave while the tempest was snarling,Flash’d a fair face that brought quiet and ease.Ever in restlessness onward I stumble,Seeking and pining, scarce heeding my way.Now have I stray’d where the wide waters rumble,Back to the scene of the lost yesterday.Lo! the red moon from the ocean’s low hazesRises in ominous grandeur to view.Strange is its face as my tortur’d eye gazesO’er the vast reaches of sparkle and blue.Straight from the moon to the shore where I’m sighingGrows a bright bridge, made of wavelets and beams.Frail may it be, yet how simple the trying;Wand’ring from earth to the orb of sweet dreams.What is yon face in the moonlight appearing;Have I at last found the maiden that fled?Out on the beam-bridge my footsteps are nearingHer whose sweet beckoning hastens my tread.Currents surround me, and drowsily swaying,Far on the moon-path I seek the sweet face.Eagerly hasting, half panting, half praying,Forward I reach for the vision of grace.Murmuring waters about me are closing,Soft the sweet vision advances to me:Done are my trials; my heart is reposingSafe with my Unda, the Bride of the Sea.EpilogueAs the rash fool, a prey of Unda’s art,Drown thro’ the passion of his fever’d heart,So are our youth, inflam’d by tempters fair,Bereft of reason and the manly air.How sad the sight of Strephon’s virile graceTurn’d to confusion at his Chloë’s face,And e’er Pelides, dear to Grecian eyes,Sulking for loss of his thrice-cherish’d prize.Brothers, attend!  If cares too sharply vex,Gain rest by shunning the destructive sex!"

The WoodBy H. P. Lovecraft by By H. P. Lovecraft,"They cut it down, and where the pitch-black aislesOf forest night had hid eternal things,They scal’d the sky with tow’rs and marble pilesTo make a city for their revellings.White and amazing to the lands aroundThat wondrous wealth of domes and turrets rose;Crystal and ivory, sublimely crown’dWith pinnacles that bore unmelting snows.And through its halls the pipe and sistrum rang,While wine and riot brought their scarlet stains;Never a voice of elder marvels sang,Nor any eye call’d up the hills and plains.Thus down the years, till on one purple nightA drunken minstrel in his careless verseSpoke the vile words that should not see the light,And stirr’d the shadows of an ancient curse.Forests may fall, but not the dusk they shield;So on the spot where that proud city stood,The shuddering dawn no single stone reveal’d,But fled the blackness of a primal wood."
